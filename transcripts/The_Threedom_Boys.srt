there there's still some good as the

70
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:45,030
thing you know what i mean because

71
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:46,290
it doesn't have being the same thing

72
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:48,390
over and over again is you're you're

73
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:50,460
you know you're walking down a corridor

74
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:52,380
and there's the other day yeah crazy

75
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:54,930
love is the documentary on netflix about

76
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:57,270
to be two tabs um and someone

77
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:58,590
jumps out at you yeah somebody jumps

78
00:02:58,590 --> 00:02:59,760
out at you but sometimes they're good

79
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,710
good sometimes good but it's very rare

80
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:03,750
and most of the time you end

81
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,580
up seeing them reset you know what

82
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:07,470
i mean like far enough away that

83
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:08,760
issue when you have to get when

84
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,800
you go through like universal studios are

85
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,420
not scary farm older there's so many

86
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:15,690
people that these would all be great

87
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:17,850
if you it's just you going through

88
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:19,740
the maze and then you know you

89
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:19,920
you

90
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:22,140
wait like twenty seconds for the next

91
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:23,940
person but because you're just there with

92
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,860
like a long stream of people who

93
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:27,390
knows if you're gonna scare oh there

94
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:30,390
was one at the the hollywood hayride

95
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,760
oh yeah be great and now it's

96
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:33,930
not good the first time i went

97
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:35,190
through that man there was something that

98
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:37,260
happened that was so scary they threw

99
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:39,060
like a garbage can at us or

100
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,080
something in it like

101
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,380
hit right next to the hole in

102
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:44,640
the hay ride itself on the hayride

103
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,020
itself yeah hit right next to us

104
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:47,041
and then they pulled it back with

105
00:03:47,041 --> 00:03:49,292
a string or whatever like yeah it

106
00:03:49,292 --> 00:03:51,360
isn't really creative and interesting now it's

107
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,550
just like boring is boring yeah but

108
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:55,950
they had a haunted house like amaze

109
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:59,430
right that was all strobe lights and

110
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,240
no warning

111
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:01,290
at all yeah that makes you say

112
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,330
oh no warning but yeah you kind

113
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:04,920
of you have to tell people you

114
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,380
have to legally luckily none of us

115
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:08,910

116
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:10,863
like there was i remember like i

117
00:04:10,863 --> 00:04:12,029

when you're walking around yeah that makes

176
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,410
me very uncomfortable that it can be

177
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:08,880

it dumb if i buy isn't a

389
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:20,865
bad idea if i buy the soundtrack

right oh yeah and listen to it

391
00:13:22,335 --> 00:13:24,255

394
00:13:27,195 --> 00:13:28,665
hansen oh dear evan hansen yeah

395
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:29,936
and i did it and then i

396
00:13:29,985 --> 00:13:31,305
thought but i might have been more

397
00:13:31,305 --> 00:13:32,505
excited to see it if i hadn't

398
00:13:32,505 --> 00:13:33,735
left yeah how did that affect you

399
00:13:33,765 --> 00:13:35,205
did you like them just as much

400
00:13:35,235 --> 00:13:36,555
i liked it because i loved the

401
00:13:36,555 --> 00:13:37,727
songs by that point so i was

402
00:13:37,755 --> 00:13:38,864
really excited to hear all the songs

403
00:13:38,864 --> 00:13:40,095
but i i filled in a lot

404
00:13:40,095 --> 00:13:41,175
of the holes because i didn't know

405
00:13:41,175 --> 00:13:42,255
all the plot i could like your

406
00:13:42,255 --> 00:13:45,255
old apartment yeah i couldn't figure everything

407
00:13:45,255 --> 00:13:46,605
out from the soundtrack because they leave

408
00:13:46,725 --> 00:13:48,135
there's a lot yeah well that's my

409
00:13:48,465 --> 00:13:48,855
that's my

410
00:13:48,885 --> 00:13:50,355
point is when you listen to a

411
00:13:50,355 --> 00:13:52,125
cast album before you see the show

412
00:13:52,545 --> 00:13:53,745
you you don't get it you don't

413
00:13:53,745 --> 00:13:55,695
get why the songs are good because

414
00:13:55,695 --> 00:13:56,895
you don't know what's happening well but

415
00:13:56,895 --> 00:13:59,415
here's the thing okay so people said

416
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:01,365
you should first listen to the original

417
00:14:01,365 --> 00:14:03,105
concept album right because then you get

418
00:14:03,105 --> 00:14:05,145
the whole story yes yeah it's really

419
00:14:05,175 --> 00:14:06,350
a new post this and like bony

420
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:08,985
vera made that not what didn't

421
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:10,065
you do like all the songs or

422
00:14:10,065 --> 00:14:12,435
something owner know why i thought you

423
00:14:12,435 --> 00:14:13,875
posted a screen grab of that i

424
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:15,765
did post a screen grab me i

425
00:14:15,765 --> 00:14:16,605
think they also like so it was

426
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:19,125
sort of like sometimes in a musical

427
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:21,255
they they make a an album about

428
00:14:21,255 --> 00:14:24,015
at first such as jesus christ superstar

429
00:14:24,135 --> 00:14:28,485
yeah viva evita was a vietnam visa

430
00:14:28,755 --> 00:14:29,175
that was

431
00:14:29,175 --> 00:14:30,555
in a concept album first i think

432
00:14:30,555 --> 00:14:32,445
it was the yeah so but ah

433
00:14:32,445 --> 00:14:33,705
and no no it was yeah it

434
00:14:33,705 --> 00:14:35,535
was what's cause maybe i just don't

435
00:14:35,535 --> 00:14:38,025
know anyway which one yeah and then

436
00:14:38,025 --> 00:14:39,645
they base a musical it's called hades

437
00:14:39,645 --> 00:14:41,775
tell you find anna you spoke these

438
00:14:41,775 --> 00:14:44,625
guys are on their phones but no

439
00:14:44,925 --> 00:14:46,935
it's germane to the that's why we

440
00:14:46,935 --> 00:14:49,215
have this guide will he does yeah

441
00:14:49,335 --> 00:14:51,435
because he's just saying he doesn't know

442
00:14:51,435 --> 00:14:54,315
balls slapping computer and in justin vernon

443
00:14:54,315 --> 00:14:56,955
is bones bony ver oh my word

444
00:14:56,977 --> 00:14:58,395
and i know that and bruce wayne

445
00:14:58,425 --> 00:14:58,995
is batman

446
00:15:00,195 --> 00:15:02,205
man one of the funniest things in

447
00:15:02,205 --> 00:15:05,685
bazillion dollar properties was ryan gallen drew

448
00:15:05,685 --> 00:15:07,875
tarver you know doing one of the

449
00:15:07,875 --> 00:15:10,935
talking heads segments write their characters and

450
00:15:11,835 --> 00:15:13,935
ah so you know it's like ah

451
00:15:13,935 --> 00:15:16,095
you know he's like ah bruce wayne

452
00:15:16,095 --> 00:15:17,385
and he's like you know it's like

453
00:15:17,385 --> 00:15:19,635
bruce wayne being batman and ryan says

454
00:15:20,193 --> 00:15:23,505
batman right like how there's it now

455
00:15:23,505 --> 00:15:25,425
the idea that you would know of

456
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:26,982
the fictional character that you would wrote

457
00:15:26,982 --> 00:15:28,905
both those fictional characters i feel like

458
00:15:28,905 --> 00:15:31,755
that's a kevin sasha thing that's a

459
00:15:31,815 --> 00:15:33,615
i think it's a tremendous joke right

460
00:15:33,765 --> 00:15:35,235
it's a tremendous because i remember we

461
00:15:35,235 --> 00:15:38,595
all wrote those before they happened and

462
00:15:38,595 --> 00:15:39,915
i'm pretty sure kevin

463
00:15:39,975 --> 00:15:41,085
or that one but yeah it's funny

464
00:15:41,179 --> 00:15:42,105
it's a good one yeah it's good

465
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:43,815
well enough i will take the credit

466
00:15:43,815 --> 00:15:45,975
away from ryan yes transferred to good

467
00:15:45,975 --> 00:15:49,095
stuff good stuff kevin good stuff anyway

468
00:15:49,095 --> 00:15:51,075
she wrote the music on east mitchell

469
00:15:52,215 --> 00:15:53,925
okay she liked the concept oh yes

470
00:15:53,925 --> 00:15:55,755

471
00:15:55,755 --> 00:15:57,975

738
00:25:02,605 --> 00:25:04,225
ground no i don't think i've ever

739
00:25:04,225 --> 00:25:05,185
seen one of them it looks like

740
00:25:05,185 --> 00:25:07,855
a urinal laid down onto the floor

741
00:25:07,885 --> 00:25:09,295
and was sleeping and taking a nap

742
00:25:09,325 --> 00:25:11,575
these are women's restrooms matter if they're

743
00:25:11,575 --> 00:25:13,435
just women's but i came across them

744
00:25:13,435 --> 00:25:16,735
in women's restrooms right and i um

745
00:25:17,035 --> 00:25:18,955
was always afraid of them because when

746
00:25:18,955 --> 00:25:20,155
i first wanted to japan a couple

747
00:25:20,155 --> 00:25:20,215
of

748
00:25:20,215 --> 00:25:21,805
years ago the first toilet i saw

749
00:25:21,805 --> 00:25:23,215
when i was in the airport was

750
00:25:23,215 --> 00:25:24,115
this and it was a hole in

751
00:25:24,115 --> 00:25:25,375
the ground it's basically a hole in

752
00:25:25,375 --> 00:25:26,755
the ground the bar on the wall

753
00:25:26,755 --> 00:25:27,655
and i was like like are you

754
00:25:27,656 --> 00:25:30,055
supposed to lean back lean and squat

755
00:25:30,055 --> 00:25:33,115
over the thing and it really intimidated

756
00:25:33,115 --> 00:25:34,285
me especially because i was really twist

757
00:25:34,315 --> 00:25:35,875
like the like you're like i'm not

758
00:25:35,875 --> 00:25:37,015
trying this and then the first time

759
00:25:37,015 --> 00:25:39,085
you like hovered above it like rosa

760
00:25:39,115 --> 00:25:40,315
to me it would

761
00:25:40,645 --> 00:25:43,135
any the craziest was but i was

762
00:25:43,135 --> 00:25:44,035
so afraid that i was gonna get

763
00:25:44,035 --> 00:25:45,865
peel over myself if i didn't if

764
00:25:45,865 --> 00:25:47,845
i just did it wrong yeah and

765
00:25:47,905 --> 00:25:49,226
then i told paul about it and

766
00:25:49,226 --> 00:25:50,485
then i did use once and i

767
00:25:50,485 --> 00:25:51,355
had to tell him i did it

768
00:25:51,475 --> 00:25:52,555
oh they had to because i was

769
00:25:52,555 --> 00:25:53,845
out to do it all over yourself

770
00:25:53,845 --> 00:25:55,195
no i did great but and what

771
00:25:55,195 --> 00:25:56,845
did i say in return he was

772
00:25:56,845 --> 00:25:59,305
proud of me but i i did

773
00:25:59,305 --> 00:26:00,535
it like a baseball dime

774
00:26:00,535 --> 00:26:01,315
and like they had like a little

775
00:26:01,405 --> 00:26:03,745
public restroom there and i went in

776
00:26:03,745 --> 00:26:05,455
and i might at that point we've

777
00:26:05,455 --> 00:26:06,535
been walking so much through you're talking

778
00:26:06,535 --> 00:26:07,465
about how when you guys went you

779
00:26:07,465 --> 00:26:08,335
want like ten miles a day you

780
00:26:08,335 --> 00:26:09,115
did the same thing and it was

781
00:26:09,115 --> 00:26:11,275
like i'm my hosting blogs are wearing

782
00:26:11,275 --> 00:26:13,345
the wrong shoes so my back was

783
00:26:13,345 --> 00:26:15,145
hurting so much and then i i

784
00:26:15,145 --> 00:26:16,135
had to pee so bad and so

785
00:26:16,135 --> 00:26:17,365
i went in and i did it

786
00:26:17,365 --> 00:26:18,415
but then i almost couldn't get up

787
00:26:18,415 --> 00:26:19,885
because my eye was like squatting in

788
00:26:19,885 --> 00:26:20,695
holding onto the bar

789
00:26:20,695 --> 00:26:22,795
or why would they do this like

790
00:26:22,795 --> 00:26:24,586
the purpose my back hurt so much

791
00:26:24,633 --> 00:26:25,975
i was like whoa with it all

792
00:26:25,975 --> 00:26:28,255
of my mizo to get up if

793
00:26:28,255 --> 00:26:29,665
you have to do a pull-up to

794
00:26:29,665 --> 00:26:31,015
get off of a toilet what are

795
00:26:31,015 --> 00:26:32,725
we even doing guys you know we're

796
00:26:32,725 --> 00:26:34,855
dying we're working our core know but

797
00:26:34,855 --> 00:26:36,475
i was still impressed by i wondered

798
00:26:36,475 --> 00:26:38,215
also if maybe someone out there can

799
00:26:38,215 --> 00:26:39,175
tell me or i could google it

800
00:26:39,175 --> 00:26:40,855
but if the bar is more

801
00:26:40,885 --> 00:26:42,655
for like people older people or people

802
00:26:42,655 --> 00:26:43,585
who don't know how to use these

803
00:26:43,585 --> 00:26:45,205
toilets and if typically you don't need

804
00:26:45,205 --> 00:26:48,602
the bar if you know yes why

805
00:26:48,715 --> 00:26:50,065
don't you use the bar you know

806
00:26:50,065 --> 00:26:51,085
what i mean i nobody was a

807
00:26:51,115 --> 00:26:52,975
real fool maybe it was like whoa

808
00:26:53,185 --> 00:26:54,505
wait wait wait wait are you like

809
00:26:54,565 --> 00:26:55,825
are you holding onto you you were

810
00:26:55,825 --> 00:26:56,965
sort of like me like you're in

811
00:26:56,965 --> 00:26:58,675
a roller coaster i was holding onto

812
00:26:58,675 --> 00:27:00,595
it and you hold the body well

813
00:27:00,625 --> 00:27:01,015
i mean if

814
00:27:01,045 --> 00:27:03,025
you're just squatting over something you don't

815
00:27:03,025 --> 00:27:04,105
need a bar i guess if i

816
00:27:04,105 --> 00:27:05,665
was wearing a dress or something i'd

817
00:27:05,665 --> 00:27:07,525
be easier but if my with pants

818
00:27:07,525 --> 00:27:08,965
on i would get peel i guess

819
00:27:09,025 --> 00:27:10,405
what do how far did the pants

820
00:27:10,405 --> 00:27:12,535
go down to like knees or their

821
00:27:12,535 --> 00:27:13,225
pants

822
00:27:15,235 --> 00:27:16,465
you mean when i pulled him down

823
00:27:16,705 --> 00:27:17,095
kaua'i

824
00:27:18,295 --> 00:27:20,245
i've pulled them down past my knees

00:27:20,365 --> 00:27:22,345
past your knees like what to shoes

826
00:27:22,975 --> 00:27:24,895
i didn't pull them to the shoe

827
00:27:25,135 --> 00:27:26,515
so between me and shoe

828
00:27:28,225 --> 00:27:30,715
cashflow what's normal for the two

829
00:27:30,925 --> 00:27:33,385

830
00:27:33,385 --> 00:27:36,295
knees whereas civic questions and making you

831
00:27:36,295 --> 00:27:38,635
feel nobody i want to picture you

832
00:27:38,665 --> 00:27:40,645
on the toilet do you pull your

833
00:27:40,645 --> 00:27:42,355
pants all the way down i've had

834
00:27:42,385 --> 00:27:44,035
your okay paul have you seen this

835
00:27:44,035 --> 00:27:46,465
where you go into a men's restroom

836
00:27:46,495 --> 00:27:47,965
boy and someone at the urinal has

837
00:27:47,965 --> 00:27:49,255
their pants all the way down like

838
00:27:49,285 --> 00:27:50,935
pastor noel boys yeah

839
00:27:51,055 --> 00:27:53,575
yes a grown ass man string why

840
00:27:53,575 --> 00:27:55,105
on earth would you ever do it's

841
00:27:55,105 --> 00:27:57,115
weird what is the reasoning okay if

842
00:27:57,115 --> 00:27:58,135
you're out there and you do it

843
00:27:58,135 --> 00:27:59,605
and then you have started doing it

844
00:27:59,635 --> 00:28:01,075
will stop doing it but also we

845
00:28:01,075 --> 00:28:03,475
hate with sorry no commenting about you

846
00:28:03,475 --> 00:28:05,425
but it's weird to see there's probably

847
00:28:05,425 --> 00:28:06,775
gotta be a reason but like what

848
00:28:06,775 --> 00:28:08,155
just not getting pee on your pants

849
00:28:08,185 --> 00:28:09,145
if you're going through the i don't

850
00:28:09,145 --> 00:28:11,095
get it i also i honestly don't

851
00:28:11,097 --> 00:28:13,105
don't know it's it's beyond me why

852
00:28:13,225 --> 00:28:14,965
guys do that it's so crazy i

853
00:28:14,965 --> 00:28:16,075
also think it's so i think it's

854
00:28:16,075 --> 00:28:17,275
weird to have urinals i think they

855
00:28:17,277 --> 00:28:19,195
should be like outlawed why can't you

856
00:28:19,195 --> 00:28:22,915
just have privacy yeah well i'm all

857
00:28:22,915 --> 00:28:24,645
for that i think that all because

858
00:28:24,645 --> 00:28:26,605
instead of making when you that's gross

859
00:28:26,635 --> 00:28:27,985
when you go to a movie theater

860
00:28:28,405 --> 00:28:30,835
instead of having one big room that

861
00:28:30,835 --> 00:28:31,225
has a

862
00:28:31,255 --> 00:28:32,635
a lot of places for a lot

863
00:28:32,635 --> 00:28:33,655
of people to go to the bathroom

864
00:28:33,655 --> 00:28:35,995
instead make like thirty little bathrooms this

865
00:28:35,995 --> 00:28:37,525
is great they should just be all

866
00:28:37,525 --> 00:28:40,645
over the place okay so nice surprise

867
00:28:40,675 --> 00:28:42,085
every seat in the mood so over

868
00:28:42,085 --> 00:28:43,345
me in the movie theater there should

869
00:28:43,345 --> 00:28:46,615
be lawyers there's doors everywhere sometimes over

870
00:28:46,648 --> 00:28:48,715
door brick wall so the door there's

871
00:28:48,715 --> 00:28:50,635

873
00:28:52,435 --> 00:28:53,125
that's fun

874
00:28:54,025 --> 00:28:56,245
sometimes a scary clown have you what's

875
00:28:56,245 --> 00:28:58,105
the craziest thing you've ever used alone

876
00:28:58,375 --> 00:29:00,865
the craziest toilet i knew we didn't

877
00:29:00,865 --> 00:29:03,505

878
00:29:03,505 --> 00:29:05,035
that i've ever made even been on

879
00:29:05,035 --> 00:29:06,195

i want one so bad well i

883
00:29:11,935 --> 00:29:13,645
will say that we happen to realise

884
00:29:13,645 --> 00:29:13,765
it

885
00:29:13,975 --> 00:29:15,745
when we went to like europe and

886
00:29:15,745 --> 00:29:18,715
stuff they're usually a separate toilet yeah

887
00:29:18,805 --> 00:29:20,695
like the yeah yeah in when we

888
00:29:20,695 --> 00:29:21,925
were just in japan i will say

889
00:29:21,925 --> 00:29:23,845
that that anytime you walked into the

890
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:26,633
bathroom it had a motion sensor with

891
00:29:26,633 --> 00:29:27,595
that toilet crazy

892
00:29:28,975 --> 00:29:31,825
like the toilets like like oh please

893
00:29:31,825 --> 00:29:32,785
shoot me

894
00:29:33,895 --> 00:29:36,895
oh my love she's norm and you

895
00:29:36,895 --> 00:29:37,915
can also press a button that makes

896
00:29:37,915 --> 00:29:39,475
like water sounds so it covers the

897
00:29:39,475 --> 00:29:40,795
sound of you going oh so yeah

898
00:29:40,795 --> 00:29:42,205
like i had a friend who when

899
00:29:42,205 --> 00:29:44,155
we were in a musical together we

900
00:29:44,155 --> 00:29:45,805
add a our dressing room had a

901
00:29:45,805 --> 00:29:47,905
tiny bathroom and he always would like

902
00:29:47,905 --> 00:29:49,975
blast the sink on yeah and then

903
00:29:49,975 --> 00:29:52,345
sing because he just didn't want any

904
00:29:52,345 --> 00:29:53,575
nurses to be i don't think i

905
00:29:53,575 --> 00:29:54,055
would ask the

906
00:29:54,090 --> 00:29:55,315
other person is saying i wouldn't want

907
00:29:55,315 --> 00:29:57,265
to be singing right but think about

908
00:29:57,475 --> 00:29:59,335
if we had this in america when

909
00:29:59,335 --> 00:30:00,925
you are in a public bathroom with

910
00:30:00,925 --> 00:30:02,774
stalls you could have a sound going

911
00:30:02,819 --> 00:30:04,195
have a sound going i feel people

912
00:30:04,195 --> 00:30:05,935
are the sound of like artists it's

913
00:30:05,935 --> 00:30:07,015
what japan is so much better than

914
00:30:07,015 --> 00:30:10,375
american i've always said that everywhere i

915
00:30:10,375 --> 00:30:12,745
also use a home the floor one

916
00:30:12,745 --> 00:30:14,185
time in france and

917
00:30:14,245 --> 00:30:18,505
old restaurant downstairs basement i went down

918
00:30:18,505 --> 00:30:19,915
there and then all they had was

919
00:30:19,915 --> 00:30:21,174
a hole in the foil like like

920
00:30:21,205 --> 00:30:24,055
ivy it was like a toilet hole

00:36:59,991 --> 00:37:01,610
do fucking it with a needle or

1127
00:37:01,610 --> 00:37:03,440
what do they do yeah yeah was

1128
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,700
it early they're taking out all the

1129
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:08,330

00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:10,910

no go ahead or butlins that your

1138
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:27,140
alias is yeah i don't i don't

1139
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:31,280
like to do specific gender things but

1140
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,720
this seems like a thing that women

1141
00:37:32,810 --> 00:37:34,670
are willing really like dark i do

1142
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:37,460
think there's some something about that i

1143
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:39,020
also feel like i was someone who

1144
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:40,400
liked to do that i think it's

1145
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,480
because men have peace

1146
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:43,610
is that erupt and so we're good

1147
00:37:43,610 --> 00:37:45,200

1284
00:42:45,385 --> 00:42:47,275
point to cover a big wardrobe and

1285
00:42:47,275 --> 00:42:49,045
set change they wrote

1286
00:42:49,135 --> 00:42:51,025
on a screen and they showed a

1287
00:42:51,025 --> 00:42:55,315
scene from the movie that's crazy nuts

1288
00:42:55,375 --> 00:42:56,935
it was right it was not so

1289
00:42:57,535 --> 00:42:58,675
i'm playing by the chimney sweep we're

van dyke know lin manuel

1294
00:43:08,095 --> 00:43:10,165
the only version i choose to brag

1295
00:43:10,165 --> 00:43:12,475
fair enough fair enough i was yellow

1296
00:43:12,475 --> 00:43:15,085
them in this and we visit revisit

1297
00:43:15,085 --> 00:43:17,095
what was the meryl streep character

1298
00:43:18,175 --> 00:43:20,845
yeah and this was played by edwin

1299
00:43:20,845 --> 00:43:23,605
plays uncle albert who is related to

1300
00:43:23,605 --> 00:43:25,465
mary poppies and chatter he's also vaguely

1301
00:43:25,465 --> 00:43:28,259
magical but when he laughs he makes

1302
00:43:28,259 --> 00:43:30,445
you fly up into the ceiling and

1303
00:43:30,445 --> 00:43:31,885
so then everybody starts laughing they're flying

1304
00:43:31,885 --> 00:43:34,225
up in the ceiling and so the

1305
00:43:34,255 --> 00:43:35,395
how did you pull that off for

1306
00:43:35,395 --> 00:43:36,505
yawn rope but let me tell you

1307
00:43:36,685 --> 00:43:38,335
the kids the two kids

1308
00:43:38,335 --> 00:43:41,215
dhs and mary poppins run wires their

1309
00:43:41,215 --> 00:43:43,255
own big heavy cables which when they

1310
00:43:43,255 --> 00:43:44,845
got hauled into the air is crazy

1311
00:43:44,905 --> 00:43:47,635
in retrospect like i remember doing high

1312
00:43:47,635 --> 00:43:49,525
school shows i think and maybe a

1313
00:43:49,525 --> 00:43:51,565
college show where people were using the

1314
00:43:51,565 --> 00:43:53,815
fully fly system yeah and on wires

1315
00:43:53,815 --> 00:43:55,915
and that in retrospect is fucking crazy

1316
00:43:55,945 --> 00:43:57,505
i can't find that there are eighteen

1317
00:43:57,505 --> 00:43:58,465
year olds think about it now

1318
00:43:58,620 --> 00:44:00,535
yes like in charge of absolutely well

1319
00:44:00,565 --> 00:44:02,605
you drop into the air of peter

1320
00:44:02,605 --> 00:44:04,195
pan like the horrible peter pan that

1321
00:44:04,195 --> 00:44:05,605
goes awry it's like a school production

1322
00:44:05,605 --> 00:44:07,811
and on wires and it's so funny

1323
00:44:07,990 --> 00:44:09,205
it's fun it was on this american

1324
00:44:09,205 --> 00:44:12,535
life matter no but the kids basically

1325
00:44:12,535 --> 00:44:13,585
keep going up when they don't expect

1326
00:44:13,585 --> 00:44:14,425
it was so

1327
00:44:16,225 --> 00:44:17,875
well this would be so like mary

1328
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:19,765
poppins would be standing there you know

1329
00:44:19,795 --> 00:44:22,753
very statuesque holding her umbrella and the

1330
00:44:22,753 --> 00:44:24,115
the raising of the umbrella was the

1331
00:44:24,115 --> 00:44:26,365
signal for her to fly away right

1332
00:44:27,595 --> 00:44:30,325
so there be like this jerky is

1333
00:44:30,475 --> 00:44:32,095
oh my try to like keep it

1334
00:44:32,095 --> 00:44:34,975
together right and act smooth but but

1335
00:44:34,975 --> 00:44:36,565
she's being hauled up on a rope

1336
00:44:36,595 --> 00:44:38,905
yeah it's not like a sophisticated system

1337
00:44:38,905 --> 00:44:41,245
yeah right so the the so the

1338
00:44:41,245 --> 00:44:43,345
two banks' children and mary poppins run

1339
00:44:43,525 --> 00:44:45,115
their cables and they're all the exact

1340
00:44:45,115 --> 00:44:45,595
same age

1341
00:44:47,035 --> 00:44:48,205
that's exactly right

1342
00:44:49,015 --> 00:44:51,895
and ah myself and uncle albert are

1343
00:44:51,895 --> 00:44:52,405
on

1344
00:44:53,485 --> 00:44:58,525
wooden platforms like just columns covered with

1345
00:44:58,525 --> 00:45:01,075
black duvet teen right to make it

1346
00:45:01,075 --> 00:45:02,575
appear as if we're just floating in

1347
00:45:02,605 --> 00:45:04,345
oh okay and so we had to

1348
00:45:04,645 --> 00:45:05,965
like keep we had to be sitting

1349
00:45:05,965 --> 00:45:07,495
like this with our legs and arms

1350
00:45:07,495 --> 00:45:10,645

1354
00:45:15,685 --> 00:45:18,115
know convey the illusion and it was

1355
00:45:18,115 --> 00:45:20,875
really any company anywhere loud to everybody

1356
00:45:21,625 --> 00:45:23,065

1466
00:49:22,045 --> 00:49:24,055
so the idea of this game is

1467
00:49:24,835 --> 00:49:28,375
one ah player will make a wish

1468
00:49:29,305 --> 00:49:30,355
to kind of wish you'd make with

1469
00:49:30,355 --> 00:49:31,555
the genie i wish i had a

1470
00:49:31,555 --> 00:49:34,045
million dollars and are we trying to

1471
00:49:34,045 --> 00:49:36,655
make it as bulletproof as possible or

1472
00:49:36,685 --> 00:49:38,815
are we just making a regulation seeing

1473
00:49:38,905 --> 00:49:41,305
well scott that i don't remember okay

1474
00:49:41,335 --> 00:49:42,175
well let's see how she

1475
00:49:42,175 --> 00:49:44,545
shakes out i think the idea is

1476
00:49:44,545 --> 00:49:45,925
you make it just like a regular

1477
00:49:46,225 --> 00:49:48,445
roll yeah and then the onus is

1478
00:49:48,445 --> 00:49:51,175
on the genie to subvert the wish

1479
00:49:51,175 --> 00:49:53,065
a monkey's paw that shit some rockies

1480
00:49:53,065 --> 00:49:55,045
paw that shit and may and come

1481
00:49:55,045 --> 00:49:57,025
up with the ironic granting of the

1482
00:49:57,025 --> 00:49:58,135
wish okay

1483
00:50:00,145 --> 00:50:00,385
i'm

1484
00:50:02,425 --> 00:50:04,975
i just shivered shivered and scott offered

1485
00:50:04,975 --> 00:50:07,795
me a headphone case that i draped

1486
00:50:07,795 --> 00:50:09,865
around her shoulder while paul was handing

1487
00:50:09,865 --> 00:50:11,515
me a jacket i don't have a

1488
00:50:11,515 --> 00:50:12,835
jacket i'm not gonna take off my

1489
00:50:12,835 --> 00:50:13,255
shirt

1490
00:50:14,545 --> 00:50:16,645
a gentleman is always code please take

1491
00:50:16,645 --> 00:50:20,035
it off ok magic mike this should

1492
00:50:20,035 --> 00:50:21,565
do i look like really cool now

1493
00:50:21,625 --> 00:50:23,605
yeah you actually look like robert palmer

1494
00:50:24,445 --> 00:50:25,975
yeah that's weird and you're gonna look

1495
00:50:25,975 --> 00:50:27,775
like his backup girl oh my

1496
00:50:30,625 --> 00:50:32,095
the idea is that the the genie

1497
00:50:32,095 --> 00:50:33,475
will then grant the wish but in

1498
00:50:33,475 --> 00:50:36,145
an ironic way that fucks over okay

1499
00:50:36,145 --> 00:50:39,565
let's try it you'll be a genie

1500
00:50:40,225 --> 00:50:41,005
poe great

1501
00:50:42,385 --> 00:50:43,615

part for you under the refers to

1503
00:50:46,161 --> 00:50:47,037

00:52:58,180 --> 00:53:00,070
the way they're just gonna plow right

1559
00:53:00,070 --> 00:53:01,780
through like you're not even there and

1560
00:53:01,780 --> 00:53:03,425
same thing with the cars you are

1561
00:53:03,425 --> 00:53:03,640
going to

1562
00:53:03,700 --> 00:53:05,830
