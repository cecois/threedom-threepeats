104
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:28,140
you say jesus didn't exist

105
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:31,050
were you going to say somebody i

106
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:32,970
don't know you or your disease dive

107
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:35,040
oh they they talk about passive income

108
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,620
they have their amazon stores that you

109
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:38,850
can have and i think klopp made

110
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:41,010
one oh yeah um so that's been

111
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:43,320
kind of fun but then just saying

112
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,430
hers got shut it was getting shut

113
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:46,110
down for lack of purchases being made

114
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:48,360
on that seems what's the unfair what

115
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,380
does the amazon store if

116
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:52,080
set up your own store like i

117
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:53,760
like the lauren store and it's like

118
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:55,800
here's my favorite items and then if

119
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,120
you buy it through my store i

120
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,190
get some money back which seems great

121
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:01,238
to fuck with amazon it's like someone

122
00:04:01,238 --> 00:04:03,030
else can make money that's anything though

123
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:04,680
you could like have a website i

124
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:06,690
think and and have a link and

125
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:09,000
you tell your fans and friends like

126
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,600
hey if you're gonna buy

127
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:11,280
something through amazon go through this link

128
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,440
because yeah it's like an affiliate link

129
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:16,170
yeah anyway yeah um seems i was

130
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:17,436
gonna say is this a scam or

131
00:04:17,436 --> 00:04:21,210
a shama raham that you that these

132
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:22,620
invites are they trying to make it

133
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:24,420
seem exclusive or they just can't handle

134
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:27,210
the web traffic or is it like

135
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:29,160
a new thing my guess more like

136
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:29,760
cry

137
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:32,610
oh i was trying it out well

138
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:34,140
it's no no but you know reveals

139
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:35,550
elite so you're like ooh i wanna

140
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:37,110
do what i'm saying that's a scam

141
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:40,200
ah or a sham monday i think

142
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,250
it's more of a sham it's more

143
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:42,570
of a sham and associate where they're

144
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:45,030
trying to make it seem elites right

145
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:47,040
but they could handle as many ways

146
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:48,930
i mean you think google could have

147
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:49,920
would not have had a problem

148
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,570
elam yeah with a bunch of people

149
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:53,130

162
00:05:20,108 --> 00:05:22,770
so i mean he's below cool blow

163
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:25,664
up deaf should not you know she's

164
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,300
hey she says this is a trial

165
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,220
protocol of a long time probationary citizen

166
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:32,190
beta yeah okay um she also is

167
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:32,490
a beta

168
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,990
but ah what was oh yeah is

169
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:38,850
my friend asks me like oh my

170
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:41,160
god where did you ah how did

171
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,810
you find that out and i just

172
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:45,660
like right back a google link like

173
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:47,280
to google not to the link of

174
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,810
the thing they're trying to just like

175
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:50,250
your favorite bit is to say i

176
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,140
looked at google dot com yes yeah

177
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:54,480
because like that's so many times when

178
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,590
if people are asking you a question

179
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:57,780
it's like something very easily global but

180
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:58,800
you don't give them the link of

181
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,450
them just the link to show that's

182
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,520
number two i feel like i mean

183
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:04,710
no better things better i think he's

184
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:06,090
better than google dot com and i

185
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:07,710
think wow right under it i was

186
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:09,360
gonna say that but i think that

187
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,970
i think emmy i agree with scott

188
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:12,930
that it's too soon to tell on

189
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:14,580
me yeah she might watches be bad

190
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:17,280
eat this true she might be ah

191
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:19,290
one of those macaulay culkin yeah she's

192
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:20,250
gonna try to push a kid off

193
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:22,890
a tree huh something yeah yeah yeah

194
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:25,110
yeah it's so ironic that it's called

195
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:27,090
the good son when he was so

196
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:28,530
bad i know but is it about

197
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:30,180
him or is it about elijah wood

198
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:33,000
i think that's sort of right they'd

199
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,140
maybe you think the good son is

200
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:34,800
macaulay cult

201
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,390
aiken and then he does bad things

202
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:38,310
and you're like actually the twist was

203
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:40,050
the title was about alleged would oh

204
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:41,610
so that's the ny channel on twist

205
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:43,170
at the end with what the title

206
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:45,657
refers to so the author comes up

207
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,640
to very specific as he comes out

208
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:51,120
lord grantham style lou was just seeing

209
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:53,520
his twists mr grantham lord grant but

210
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:54,960
mr graham calling back

211
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:57,090
our last days i shall be holy

212
00:06:57,090 --> 00:06:59,100
what is the ultimate dream factory

213
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,650
it's already said in the new one

214
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,290
mr mosley says oh one of the

215
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:05,970
one of the few hours the hollywood

216
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:07,020
at the end of this last film

217
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,430
right and he i think he becomes

218
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:09,300
a screenwriter yeah

219
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:12,840
i love that movie why does it

220
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:15,180
does the latest dance and have the

221
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:16,920
the new doubt the most recent of

222
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:19,703
everybody's oh they have movies the oldie

223
00:07:19,703 --> 00:07:22,620
of movies now six seasons and a

224
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:25,860
movie is is upstairs downstairs good i

225
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:27,030
was thinking about that my parents used

226
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:27,690
to watch it when i was a

227
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:29,640
kid i watched those in adult and

228
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:30,240
really enjoyed it

229
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:31,740
yeah yeah i think it would be

230
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:33,900
good it goes through different time periods

231
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:36,420
i think it's bad that that pbx

232
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:40,350
look exists yes john das no no

233
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:42,750
no i now with streaming and everything

234
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,700
like that i feel like you never

235
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:47,250
go through pbx anymore when it used

236
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:49,380
to be so reliably wonderful to like

237
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:50,640
as as something

238
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:51,930
you know to watch as opposed to

239
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:54,060
just be their slogan reliably wonderful yeah

240
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:56,400
but you know what i mean like

241
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,390
b now why we're reliably wonderful why

242
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:02,370
would you happen across pbx at this

243
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:03,540
point you know it would take a

244
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:05,070
lot you have to be little channel

245
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:06,750
i yeah yeah it's i mean even

246
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,760
you know the classics like sesame street

247
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,520
happen with showmax their app on apple

248
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,170
tv how often do you watch it

249
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:14,490
never exactly

250
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:16,518
yeah you're right i can switch artifact

251
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:19,860
so yeah but but isn't it wonderful

252
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:21,210
very easy to find and skip over

253
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:22,920
isn't it incredible that they had a

254
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,900
huge hit with with downton abbey yeah

255
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:26,310
and it was just word of mouth

256
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:28,650
that was their show yeah well i

257
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:30,750
knew it was you know yeah four

258
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:33,300
but it was because they didn't have

259
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:33,990
billboards

260
00:08:34,805 --> 00:08:36,630
bad review on every day zappa you

261
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:38,070
know what why did you ever watch

262
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:41,580
it well because i'd love some matters

263
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:47,010
good manners badwater yeah exactly yeah lucy

264
00:08:47,035 --> 00:08:48,330
i was gonna deal with the manners

265
00:08:49,448 --> 00:08:51,450
i never really watched that show like

266
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:52,470
i don't really know you got to

267
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:54,390
see it because it's because it's got

268
00:08:54,815 --> 00:08:58,320
ah ah dialogue and actual i did

269
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,030
watch the first episode and i think

270
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:01,860
there was a surprise blow job that

271
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:03,900
kind of threw me oily and i

272
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:05,640
was like what's surprised you the audience

273
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,140
or the person receiving it the person

274
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:09,240
giving everyone involved what am i doing

275
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:10,260
but

276
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:11,910
good to hear

277
00:09:13,045 --> 00:09:13,871
stuff my beautiful

278
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:16,560
yeah

279
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:20,250
and then i found myself giving a

280
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:21,000
blow job

281
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:23,850
what i meant to set up the

282
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:24,630
croquet

283
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:28,320
well if you if you had to

284
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,040
live back then

285
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:31,770
and you couldn't be part of the

286
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:34,080
aristocracy yeah what job would you want

287
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:34,290
to do

288
00:09:36,524 --> 00:09:37,920
what are my options like if you

289
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,180
could be one of the downton abbey

290
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:41,310
like servants so it's like oh chauffeur

291
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:43,350
you want to show love to drive

292
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,870
those cars yeah yeah yeah that would

293
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:47,130
be he would always talk to me

294
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:48,630
but it would be so bumpy

295
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,930
it yeah you went over a bump

296
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:53,130
the other day and you had a

297
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:54,480
bad time a lot of tire that's

298
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:57,360
right are you now reconsidering your choice

299
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,520
that would happen to you all the

300
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,320
time do you think pull the tire

301
00:10:01,329 --> 00:10:03,450
just wood or pop oh that's right

302
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:05,430
so they're more durable yeah i'm not

303
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:07,200
worried about the bumps now but the

304
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,730
roads also are probably in a way

305
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:09,240
better

306
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,050
yeah worse well they weren't they weren't

307
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:14,240
like i don't think they have things

308
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,070
like dirt and big potholes you had

309
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:18,480
you had dirt yeah yeah but you

310
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,670
had like it was you had some

311
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:23,010
risks that got me when you weren't

312
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:25,650
just driving over the country like that

313
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:28,050
roads that but their roads just because

314
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:29,640
like people have gone down them so

315
00:10:29,672 --> 00:10:30,660
oh they're not paying

316
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:33,810
eve they are a little medieval times

317
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:36,990
like here is like the third yeah

318
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:39,000
we know is like the tenth to

319
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,590
the thirties i think yeah yes it's

320
00:10:40,813 --> 00:10:41,940
some top so you but what if

321
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:44,310
they had paved roads empty hence they

322
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,480
did in the city i'm just saying

323
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,580
like if you got from downton abbey

324
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:49,620
and went to the city you'd have

325
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:50,700
to go over a lot of bumps

326
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:51,990
i don't think so i just agree

327
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,250
i think it would be bumpy i

328
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:54,180
don't know i don't know why we're

329
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:57,540
having to argue bumpy roads and nineteen

330
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:58,815
ten where i know i can you

331
00:10:58,860 --> 00:10:59,070
run

332
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:02,550
i would disagree with me when you

333
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:04,320
could have just paid no mind to

334
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,750
that's exactly i think i'd like to

335
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:08,024
be like um

336
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:10,710
you could be a scullery maid what's

337
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:11,040
that

338
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:15,000
you could be what does that she

339
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,500
would wash the pots and pans right

340
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:17,610
oh no i'd like to be the

341
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:19,620
the cook the cook but i don't

342
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,000
know how to keep the statue might

343
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,260
be good the cook is allowed to

344
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:24,120
be sad yeah you assume you would

345
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,620
be well you have the skill in

346
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:26,940
this game that we're playing right now

347
00:11:27,005 --> 00:11:28,830
you are good at the thing yes

348
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:30,780
no no it's you held then i

349
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:31,800
guess i'd be like the nanny

350
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:34,620
like you know what to call it

351
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,470
i guess did they have a dedicated

352
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:40,110
nanny back then or there or did

353
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:41,310
everyone just kind of take turns on

354
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:42,870
it i can't remember i yeah i

355
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:44,340
don't because they did eventually have babies

356
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:46,050
there yeah but you never saw like

357
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:47,460
one of the people i don't remember

358
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:49,134
my only job is being an yeah

359
00:11:49,134 --> 00:11:51,480
yeah yeah interesting they also sort of

360
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,950
but also made it seem like the

361
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:55,020
servants didn't play that much of a

362
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:55,860
part in a baby

363
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:57,570
his life when of course they would

364
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,670
they wouldn't want to remember it seemed

365
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:01,590
like it i do remember one scene

366
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:02,490
where they was just there and there

367
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:04,140
was a baby they suddenly the baby

368
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,880
came in everyone went oh wow

369
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:08,100
yeah they played with the baby a

370
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,480
little zed all right take her away

371
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:11,670
yeah so i don't know that's living

372
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:13,590

00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:18,240
like my friend did too okay it's

375
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,130

and see some all of someone's belongings

525
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:58,170

kind of like yeah oh

527
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:00,270

557
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:02,550
it's similar it's based on the rapture

558
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:04,830
the first one her camera know these

559
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:06,150
these are the seventy s this is

560
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:07,890
not the cross this way i played

561
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,210
just not the cross and the switchblade

562
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:10,170
with erik estrada

563
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:12,840
i remember that that he did a

564
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,460
christian movie called the cross and switchblade

565
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,200
but um back in the sixties but

566
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:18,840
ah this this is the thief in

567
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:21,120
the night which is from a bible

568
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,470
verse and it's basically the first ones

569
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:24,270
very tidy which is a woman wakes

570
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:26,250
up in her entire family is gone

571
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:29,070
the raptures happened oh and she's the

572
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:31,230
one who's never believed in in all

573
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:37,350
oh and basically like the government starts

574
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:38,790
to oppress people where everyone needs a

575
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:40,680
bar code tattooed on their either their

576
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,990
forehead or left-hand i have talked about

577
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:44,910
this yeah anyway but then then the

578
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:47,010
fifth one is just like zombies chasing

579
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:49,950

580
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:53,340
yeah it does have nuclear explosion happens

581
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,660

00:18:55,770 --> 00:18:58,080
god's wrath no no alright

584
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:02,250

669
00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:56,473

671
00:21:58,980 --> 00:21:59,580

00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,590
sorry i'm just getting excited i just

674
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:06,420
think you should hang up because i'm

675
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:07,320
going to have to leave i mean

676
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:08,460
or you can keep talking no i

677
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:09,900
just needed a second opinion on this

678
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:11,730
thing or two psychics think the same

679
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:13,650
thing then it's actually okay so what

680
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:15,450
i can't be sure yeah i'm still

681
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:17,310
here yeah okay so this this all

682
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:18,870
lines up with the person who gave

683
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:19,680
me the first opinion

684
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:21,240
okay so he saying something you say

685
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:22,710
he says the exact same thing that

686
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:24,090
makes sense because that's exactly what's going

687
00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:26,190
to happen right yeah why don't you

688
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:27,240
get to the i'm gonna end the

689
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:27,660
scene here

690
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,990
why don't people get a second opinion

691
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:32,040
from another psychic

692
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:34,200
you know i think a lot of

693
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,460
people don't want to break the spell

694
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:36,570
you know what i mean i do

695
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:39,870
it with a doctor that's off the

696
00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:42,480
idea if people truly know what's gonna

697
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:46,080
happen to be people know it because

698
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,310
then they would realize there's no such

699
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:49,710
thing as psychics don't wanna ruin it

700
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:53,100
oh if you seem healthy goldman yeah

701
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:54,300
no and i need to watch this

702
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:55,410
i don't even know a thing about

703
00:22:55,410 --> 00:22:56,700
it but i keep hearing about it

704
00:22:56,730 --> 00:22:58,464
absolutely watch i was reluctant to watch

705
00:22:58,475 --> 00:22:59,880
but i'm glad i don't know anything

706
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:01,080
but i heard it's good there's a

707
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,450
psychic in that yeah no spoiler no

708
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:04,860
i won't spoil anything about the cycle

709
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:07,050
but essentially but this all reminded me

710
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:09,090
talking about this reminded me that article

711
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:10,200
i sent you guys the other day

712
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:11,100
bass

713
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:12,960
based on a previous episode discussion we

714
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:17,790
had about hypnotism yes ah now teach

715
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:21,240
the controversy so just to just to

716
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,380
back up a little we were talking

717
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:24,420
about how i tried to get hypnotized

718
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:25,890
in a show when i was young

719
00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:28,200
and it didn't work but i pretended

720
00:23:28,222 --> 00:23:29,430
and i went along with it and

721
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:30,540
i raised my arms like they were

722
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:31,260
light as a feather

723
00:23:31,749 --> 00:23:32,880
there were balloons on the end of

724
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,800
my fingers and it was raised and

725
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,240
i didn't get picked for the show

726
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,800
and i was secretly glad because i

727
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:40,080
was just faking it and some people

728
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,850
have said you know some people have

729
00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:43,830
replied oh yes this is what those

730
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:45,360
hypnotism shows are they just find the

731
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,310
most extroverted person and everyone is faking

732
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:51,420
it and so we're good theory so

733
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:54,060
homes accurate this then after we did

734
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:56,730
that episode was extroverted person in everyone

735
00:23:56,730 --> 00:23:58,346
is faking it yeah everyone's faking it

736
00:23:58,346 --> 00:23:59,520
so just find a person who will

737
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,050
like go along with it and do

738
00:24:01,050 --> 00:24:02,430
the acting like a chicken and stuff

739
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:04,950
oh so i wasn't extroverted enough i

740
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:06,570
guess um i got to work a

741
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:09,990
little harder but um this article came

742
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:11,580
out called i faked my

743
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:15,030
the hypnosis during therapy and then lied

744
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:17,543
about it for years i know this

745
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:19,650
is fascinated it's a great title and

746
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:22,140
it's literally this woman writes woman notes

747
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:25,350
a fellow named patrick i'm sorry waster

748
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,460
i know you would think it would

749
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:28,201
be a woman because lying is something

750
00:24:28,201 --> 00:24:28,410
that

751
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,840
no i thought i thought i was

752
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,580
way under there was liking work that

753
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:33,600
made me think it was a woman

754
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,828
but um yeah i thought it was

755
00:24:34,828 --> 00:24:35,820
a woman too but i just looked

756
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:37,590
down and it's this guy patrick patrick

757
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:40,050
wake doctor he's a buzzfeed contributor i'll

758
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:41,160
tell you that much thanks for your

759
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:43,140
contribution one thing that he feels her

760
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:45,060
but i thought was really interesting i

761
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:46,980
wanted to try with you guys yeah

762
00:24:47,010 --> 00:24:48,780
is that he wrote there's ah there's

763
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:49,680
a little test

764
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:52,050
that hypnotists will do yes is there

765
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:53,940
to see if you can be hypnotized

766
00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:55,200
you're more likely to be able to

767
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,210
be hypnotized susceptible so you roll your

768
00:24:57,210 --> 00:24:59,340
eyes back what does it roll your

769
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:00,600
eyes back in your head and close

770
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,670
your eyes right and when you do

771
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:04,920
if your eyes come back so if

772
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,090
i look at you and i'm only

773
00:25:06,090 --> 00:25:08,160
seeing your sclera a white part of

774
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,900
the eye well that's gonna show me

775
00:25:09,990 --> 00:25:12,690
it's clear you no one has ever

776
00:25:12,690 --> 00:25:14,280
seen my dad and that you're more

777
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:16,560
likely to be hypnotized but if your

778
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:18,240
eyes kind of come back you are

779
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,340
less susceptible okay if your eyes are

780
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:21,570
just in place when you open your

781
00:25:21,570 --> 00:25:23,280
eyes you know like you roll back

782
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,660
and close your eyes and if your

783
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:27,690
eyes don't roll if your irises right

784
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:29,160
so let me just do what you

785
00:25:29,370 --> 00:25:30,060
asked me to do and

786
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:31,530
you tell me okay roll your eyes

787
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:32,880
back and close your eyes

788
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,240
i see i feel like you had

789
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,470
a lot of iris

790
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:40,560
too much iris like let me show

791
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:43,050
you like the goosebumps i'm gonna see

792
00:25:43,050 --> 00:25:45,390
what happens when i do okay yeah

793
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,300
okay no i just square a square

794
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:49,770
for days oh wait so i'm supposed

795
00:25:49,770 --> 00:25:51,510
to keep my mind open like you're

796
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:53,220
supposed to roll back as far as

797
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:55,080
you can and then close your eyes

798
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:56,910
okay okay here here and i see

799
00:25:56,910 --> 00:25:58,740
what you're doing it has made me

800
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:00,720
all is well re doing okay i

801
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,860
was about to do it he's rolling

802
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:03,300
his eyes back i can't even roll

803
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,650
i know you can't can't do it

804
00:26:04,650 --> 00:26:05,700
so you're not saying that's why you're

805
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:07,950
not hypnotized let me try it okay

806
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:13,470
what happened is really funny

807
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:16,410
it's was it i opener i was

808
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,180
doing what happened tonight they went back

809
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:20,220
you i still saw your iris while

810
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:21,750
you were closing right yeah but you

811
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:23,850
got pretty far but some people can't

812
00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:25,020
roll their eyes when you got pretty

813
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:26,310
but that means i can't be advertised

814
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:29,970
so supposedly according to patrick wow miku

815
00:26:29,970 --> 00:26:31,650
who wrote this article well i don't

816
00:26:31,650 --> 00:26:33,090
know i talk about the story blog

817
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:34,770
you leave let's talk about this article

818
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:36,660
a second because ah just to some

819
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:37,761
by the way when i saw the

820
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:39,300
u so i think lawrence said there's

821
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:41,400
an eye roll test and i was

822
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,140
like and i like if the comedian

823
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:44,821
if the images tries to advertise you

824
00:26:44,821 --> 00:26:46,860
and you're like come on dude like

825
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:49,650
okay i get it baby clara after

826
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:52,080
he entered come on and tell elsa

827
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:56,310
yeah so this first era dispersing layer

828
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:59,760
ah this person went to a hypnotist

829
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,970
because ah he was having a lot

830
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:06,240
of ah mental anguish um the lingering

831
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,070
pain of a divorce a lot of

832
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:09,660
anxiety now i feel i thought he

833
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:10,860
felt one of his own quizzes

834
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:15,630
um and he went to get hypnotized

835
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:20,430
and essentially paid for three you gotta

836
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:21,810
pay for three sessions i think in

837
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:22,920
advance and it was a lot of

838
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:27,060
money and um he went to the

839
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:28,980
therapist that would make me suspicious right

840
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,030
away i know they say well if

841
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:30,780
you're gonna do this you have to

842
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:32,130
do three yeah

843
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:34,470
nothing interesting and painted nice thing you

844
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:35,820
know you're gonna want like yeah i

845
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,500
feel like a lot of beauty things

846
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:38,580
will have you do that right oh

847
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:39,360
if you're gonna do this you should

848
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,890
do six sessions and you get this

849
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:42,540
discount and blah blah blah and then

850
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:43,860
it's like at the end of all

851
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:45,390
i don't know if i want that

852
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:47,580
yes but i'm missing on a discount

853
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:49,200
because i'm tried it yet for me

854
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,370
the issue and i think i think

855
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:52,290
the real person who does hypnotism

856
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:53,850
brings us up halfway through is like

857
00:27:54,210 --> 00:27:55,860
this hypnotist was saying oh and we'll

858
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:57,630
delve into past lives which to me

859
00:27:57,630 --> 00:27:59,370
is like oh you're not a serious

860
00:27:59,370 --> 00:28:01,650
person yeah this point yeah so and

861
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:03,750
that's what the anyway so but but

862
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:05,370
this guy this guy goes in he

863
00:28:05,370 --> 00:28:07,650
does the first session pretends to be

864
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:10,410
hypnotized it doesn't work he's awake the

865
00:28:10,410 --> 00:28:12,540
entire time says at the end like

866
00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:13,860
oh that was really good yeah and

867
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:16,770
i sure was hypnotized yeah and then

868
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:18,360
the then the second one oh by

869
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:19,770
the way he starts to kind of

870
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:21,570
talk about his feelings first before the

871
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:23,310
hypnotism of the persons like not interesting

872
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:24,720
does not and will just tell you

873
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:28,890
no feelings just a separate person no

874
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:30,960
this is the third hypnotist is a

875
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,550
separate person from the person being hipped

876
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:34,620
knows if that's what you're asking however

877
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:38,040
thank you i'm saying did the was

878
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,840
the therapist the hypnotist or was a

879
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,520
separate it was a it was a

880
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:44,070
hypnotherapy person which is not like you

881
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:45,630
can't be credited for it

882
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:47,100
so and forgive me because i have

883
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,570
not read the article because if somebody

884
00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:49,530
sends me a link it goes right

885
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:52,350
in the trash okay um wow what

886
00:28:53,610 --> 00:28:55,200
that's i'm certainly talks about it for

887
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,450
a while was ah what you pretend

888
00:28:57,450 --> 00:28:58,800
to do if read it right

889
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,910
i started writing for buzzfeed oh um

890
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:05,430
did he go to a regular therapist

891
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:07,230
first or was this his first stop

892
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:08,760
was no i think i think he

893
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,040
i think maybe he did and again

894
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,930
i'm just you know i read this

895
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:13,950
a week ago when i sent it

896
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:15,990
to you but as i recall he

897
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:17,280
tried a lot of different stuff and

898
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,650
finding the price and finally settled on

899
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:19,980
hypno

900
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:21,480
racism because there were various people who

901
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,010
had said like oh this really works

902
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,750
right so we're all hip to justice

903
00:29:24,810 --> 00:29:27,510
so he found one who said oh

904
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:28,770
you gotta come in three times and

905
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:30,780
relevant to past lives first-time they just

906
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:33,000
hypnotized and he goes he goes okay

907
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,140
now play this every night as you

908
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:36,180
go to sleep the tape of it

909
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:37,980
and then the second time he goes

910
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:39,300
okay now we're gonna delve into past

911
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:40,140
lives he said

912
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:44,010
bill pretends to be hypnotized and then

913
00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:46,920
they then the the hypnotherapist says like

914
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:49,710
okay now you're in your past life

915
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:50,790
and tell me what your name is

916
00:29:50,790 --> 00:29:51,990
it could be anything it could be

917
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:54,390
like a sound even and he just

918
00:29:54,390 --> 00:30:00,120
goes like buh buh ah alright bo

919
00:30:00,698 --> 00:30:02,130
well you can't see me on the

920
00:30:02,130 --> 00:30:04,890
spot because i'm now speaking to book

921
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:08,730
so um so so he does the

922
00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:10,170
whole thing and he's like in his

00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,780
a dirty couch and going why is

925
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:14,250

926
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:15,900
of the money i'm giving like a

927

clean their couch um and then he's

928
00:30:18,930 --> 00:30:20,460
quality comes out of it

929
00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:22,020
it and goes like oh that was

930
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:23,550

appointment he goes nope i'm cured

934
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:33,120
um so but here's the weird part

935
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:35,550
the lying about it for years yeah

936
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:37,290
two he lied about it as he

937
00:30:37,290 --> 00:30:38,550
said he was open to all of

938
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:40,980
his harmonies like i did this thing

939
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:43,380
you've gotta doing it really working for

940
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:46,620
me that's that is very maybe that's

941
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:48,360
what he actually got hypnotized to do

942
00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:50,340
i know this really was just recommend

943
00:30:50,610 --> 00:30:50,910
system

944
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:52,470
i don't know whether it's like you

945
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:54,000
don't have to tell the story about

946
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,250
hypnotism is it to seem interesting or

947
00:30:56,250 --> 00:30:57,810
is it to seem but it's like

948
00:30:57,810 --> 00:30:59,130
it would be such an interesting story

949
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:01,050
to say i went to a hypnotist

950
00:31:01,050 --> 00:31:02,040
and it was all a lie and

951
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,630
i was faking it yeah does he

952
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:05,730
say why he lied about it no

953
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:07,410
he just kind of says like i

954
00:31:07,410 --> 00:31:08,850
know if you're my friend and you're

955
00:31:08,850 --> 00:31:10,890

like that and i found out they've

958
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:15,900
been lying to me that way this

959
00:31:15,930 --> 00:31:17,910
isn't be hilarious i had such a

960
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:20,430
that would be wild if you saw

00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,450
something your friend said oh only heard

00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:26,010
them say many yeah oh by the

964
00:31:26,010 --> 00:31:27,240
way she's never done that kind of

965
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,740
medicine yeah and like hero an article

966
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:30,450
about it reminded me of paul's book

967
00:31:30,450 --> 00:31:31,230
about how he quit

968
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:32,730
smoking and how like what if you

969
00:31:32,730 --> 00:31:35,940
were still smoked wow yeah i told

970
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:37,770
everyone about that book yeah it's just

971
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:39,420
a weird thing to do is so

972
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:42,270
strange also and i had a totally

973
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:43,830
different idea based on the art of

974
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:44,940
the title of the art of what

975
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:46,320
the article would be i thought it

976
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,000
was he had a therapist who at

977
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,390
some point suggested hypnotherapy and he didn't

978
00:31:51,390 --> 00:31:52,890
go under but then he he kept

979
00:31:52,890 --> 00:31:55,620
continuing to see this therapist for years

980
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,570
and was saying like yes so you

981
00:31:57,570 --> 00:32:00,210
did hypnotize me and um not that

982
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:02,705
he went around telling telling others yeah

983
00:32:02,705 --> 00:32:04,260
that's the bizarre part and i don't

984
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:06,240
think he ever explains why he does

985
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,530
it he needs i do think i

986
00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:09,570
could have a follow up article with

987
00:32:09,570 --> 00:32:11,520
this yeah definitely see lying to the

988
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:12,990
person and saying it work because i

989
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:14,550
definitely have had situations yeah where i

990
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:17,850
find myself no problem weird sort of

991
00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:19,800
like i got like a free rookie

992
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:21,600

993
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,500

995
00:32:24,690 --> 00:32:26,160

bug

1000
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:34,110
of cypress california but that i'm all

1001
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:35,760
ready to go but then telling your

1002
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,770
friends about it i'm saying it were

1003
00:32:37,770 --> 00:32:38,820
up to me that they should do

1004
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:40,980
it yeah yeah but in any case

1005
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:43,200
so he wondered can anyone be hypnotized

1006
00:32:43,230 --> 00:32:45,870
anyway without lying about yeah anyone to

1007
00:32:45,870 --> 00:32:48,090
a person who who who actually was

1008
00:32:48,090 --> 00:32:50,370
like oh the first thing is like

1009
00:32:50,370 --> 00:32:51,870
people talking about past lives that

1010
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:54,690
it's like quackery you know that's you

1011
00:32:54,690 --> 00:32:56,100
know he goes but no i mean

1012
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:57,420
this is how you actually do get

1013
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:59,130
hypnotized and talked to some people who

1014
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:02,310
have these kind of sessions on tape

1015
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:03,870
that they play every night because they

1016
00:33:03,870 --> 00:33:05,340
have trouble going to sleep and they

1017
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:07,200
go i have never heard the end

1018
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,210
of this tape because i'm it i'm

1019
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:11,550
out and he goes thing and he

1020
00:33:11,550 --> 00:33:12,030
goes well

1021
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:13,020
you know a lot of those just

1022
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:15,990
like psyching your body into think it's

1023
00:33:15,990 --> 00:33:18,568
one of my albums oh no oh

1024
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:20,430
i've never heard the end because i'm

1025
00:33:20,430 --> 00:33:22,709
just about to to turn on and

1026
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:23,160
fast

1027
00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:25,350
but a lot of it is just

1028
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:27,870
psyching your body into like a meditative

1029
00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:29,460
state yes good in order to fall

1030
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:31,741
asleep sure so but yeah yeah so

1031
00:33:31,741 --> 00:33:32,760
i just want to follow up with

1032
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:37,380
that about hypnotism the closest i feel

1033
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:39,870
i've allowed myself to get to hypnotism

1034
00:33:39,870 --> 00:33:42,630
is wanting to drunk history was allowing

1035
00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:44,430
myself to be that volant yeah

1036
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,260
did you feel that way is so

1037
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:48,060
weird because every time i did it

1038
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:49,620
i never felt i think i did

1039
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:51,840
it twice agency every time i never

1040
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:55,410
felt um that drunk during it but

1041
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:57,150
i look at it and i'm like

1042
00:33:57,330 --> 00:34:00,060
i am yeah i obviously was i

1043
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:01,170
was drinking more than i ever would

1044
00:34:01,170 --> 00:34:02,426
drink and i can get drunk off

1045
00:34:02,433 --> 00:34:03,960
very little so i was like but

1046
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:04,590
as much the sich

1047
00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:07,560
curation was so unnatural that like it's

1048
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:08,850
like my body was still kind of

1049
00:34:08,850 --> 00:34:10,020
going like you're fine

1050
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,570
and it's like no and also that's

1051
00:34:12,570 --> 00:34:14,010
definitely how i've been talking to someone

1052
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:15,240
at a party and think that i'm

1053
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:17,700
fine and i'm like not is weird

1054
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:18,900
but you feel like you are more

1055
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:20,670
like in a tribe and i blacked

1056
00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:22,973
out oh so i had no reckon

1057
00:34:22,973 --> 00:34:24,000
you have it because i feel like

1058
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,230
i definitely watched her do you like

1059
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:26,640
fall over at some point and in

1060
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:28,890
your couch and like no economics i

1061
00:34:28,890 --> 00:34:30,360
did not fully mix you up with

1062
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:30,570
some

1063
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:32,400
one point i did have like a

1064
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,920
little apparently a little nap because i

1065
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:36,900
think it was after i was done

1066
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:38,490
and they were like they left the

1067
00:34:38,490 --> 00:34:40,680
camera on like she people packing shit

1068
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:42,480
up and everything like yep equipment and

1069
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,460
everything yeah i'm just peacefully it's actually

1070
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:46,410
kind of swimming but it was i've

1071
00:34:46,410 --> 00:34:47,580
only watched it once i feel like

1072
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:48,870
i wanna watch it again because it

1073
00:34:48,870 --> 00:34:50,910
was so shocking to see myself

1074
00:34:50,910 --> 00:34:52,680
i like that yeah but that's why

1075
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:54,240
i did it yeah because i wanted

1076
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:56,430
to be like that because i didn't

1077
00:34:56,430 --> 00:34:58,260
know what was going to happen yeah

1078
00:34:58,290 --> 00:34:59,670
and i was like i just want

1079
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:01,322
to give myself over to that experience

1080
00:35:01,322 --> 00:35:03,090
that's really fun you know and like

1081
00:35:03,090 --> 00:35:04,830
without having to do shots when we

1082
00:35:04,830 --> 00:35:06,630
did it was like he set up

1083
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:07,710
a game where we were doing like

1084
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:09,930
water or vodka shots yeah roulette oh

1085
00:35:09,930 --> 00:35:11,070
yeah and i

1086
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:12,120
ended up getting back like so many

1087
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:13,890
times i never do shots i'm i

1088
00:35:13,890 --> 00:35:15,090
mean so it's like i know that

1089
00:35:15,090 --> 00:35:17,160
i was but it's it i think

1090
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:18,180
there is that part of your body

1091
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:19,950
sometimes when you're drunk that's like telling

1092
00:35:19,950 --> 00:35:22,710
you everything's great yeah yeah and that's

1093
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:25,590
why we're going you're having great conversations

1094
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:26,610
why it's so fun to drive

1095
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:30,150
oh driving drugs stuff bad i remember

1096
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:31,680

and like i i put water on

1325
00:43:25,065 --> 00:43:27,465
my face and then i looked in

1326
00:43:27,465 --> 00:43:29,265
the mirror and i saw my pupils

1327
00:43:29,265 --> 00:43:32,925

agree to give yourself up to the

1332
00:43:40,545 --> 00:43:42,615
experience we went yeah we went to

1333
00:43:42,615 --> 00:43:44,265
this we went to this party and

1334
00:43:44,265 --> 00:43:45,165
then when we got to the party

1335
00:43:45,165 --> 00:43:47,055
it was like weird for us because

1336
00:43:47,865 --> 00:43:49,395
we were the only people that were

1337
00:43:49,395 --> 00:43:51,675
having this one experience and we were

1338
00:43:51,675 --> 00:43:54,645
like we were not the greatest guest

1339
00:43:54,645 --> 00:43:56,205
at this party because we kept going

1340
00:43:56,205 --> 00:43:59,325
off by ourselves talking about touch stuff

1341
00:44:01,935 --> 00:44:04,485
yeah i love this fans of the

1342
00:44:04,485 --> 00:44:07,485
show basically you're listening to two nerds

1343
00:44:07,485 --> 00:44:10,245
talk about being on what am i

1344
00:44:10,485 --> 00:44:12,795
i mean you're cooler than us yeah

1345
00:44:12,825 --> 00:44:14,505
true i was pretty cool i think

1346
00:44:14,505 --> 00:44:16,545
we're all really cool and i think

1347
00:44:16,545 --> 00:44:19,679
our stories are ah neighborly i'm simply

1348
00:44:19,769 --> 00:44:20,595
that or they were

1349
00:44:20,595 --> 00:44:22,515
relatable to a bunch of squares hopefully

1350
00:44:22,575 --> 00:44:24,045
well yeah because everyone there because everyone

1351
00:44:24,045 --> 00:44:26,115
out there goes everyone does coke you

1352
00:44:26,115 --> 00:44:27,495

1353
00:44:28,545 --> 00:44:30,255
whatever i do your thing if you're

1354
00:44:30,255 --> 00:44:31,785
like you whenever you want we're just

1355
00:44:31,785 --> 00:44:33,735

00:44:35,565 --> 00:44:37,905
around you alright we have to take

1358
00:44:37,905 --> 00:44:38,115
a break

1359
00:44:47,295 --> 00:44:49,965
and we're back and we're back and

1360
00:44:50,025 --> 00:44:51,105
by the way one thing i want

1361
00:44:51,105 --> 00:44:52,395
to say oh people give us a

1362
00:44:52,395 --> 00:44:53,805
bad rap for telling the same stories

1363
00:44:53,805 --> 00:44:56,565
over and over yeah i started the

1364
00:44:56,565 --> 00:44:59,385
story thinking i'd told it before about

1365
00:44:59,385 --> 00:45:01,125
the thief in the night series and

1366
00:45:01,125 --> 00:45:03,225
you guys were like no what is

1367
00:45:03,225 --> 00:45:04,515
that oh of course

1368
00:45:04,695 --> 00:45:06,525
so it's we know it's a half

1369
00:45:06,525 --> 00:45:07,995
my fault half year this is how

1370
00:45:07,995 --> 00:45:08,295
it is

1371
00:45:10,215 --> 00:45:11,325
this is just life i mean i

1372
00:45:11,325 --> 00:45:13,635
think you tell the same jokes in

1373
00:45:13,635 --> 00:45:16,095
line why my question is why do

1374
00:45:16,095 --> 00:45:17,955
any of you remember these stories we

1375
00:45:18,165 --> 00:45:20,805
oh good point yeah forgot you should

1376
00:45:20,805 --> 00:45:25,155
forget everybody hypnotized yourselves into forgetting everything

1377
00:45:25,155 --> 00:45:26,385
we talk about on the show this

1378
00:45:26,385 --> 00:45:29,415
is i'm constantly saying this folks

1379
00:45:29,505 --> 00:45:31,485
you've got to hypnotize yourself you got

1380
00:45:31,485 --> 00:45:33,615
to do it there's the love living

1381
00:45:33,615 --> 00:45:36,765
in you have the stories okay it's

1382
00:45:36,765 --> 00:45:38,385
also funny that you won't remember a

1383
00:45:38,385 --> 00:45:40,395
story until there's one crucial detail it's

1384
00:45:40,395 --> 00:45:42,405
like yeah oh i have her i

1385
00:45:42,405 --> 00:45:43,575
know it oh i remember it was

1386
00:45:43,575 --> 00:45:45,465
the craziest thing oh i know well

1387
00:45:45,465 --> 00:45:46,575
that's kind of what that game was

1388
00:45:46,575 --> 00:45:48,795
really hard were no questions because i'm

1389
00:45:48,795 --> 00:45:49,635
not listening to your song

1390
00:45:49,665 --> 00:45:50,775
but i don't have the context at

1391
00:45:50,775 --> 00:45:52,035
all and i know who you are

1392
00:45:52,095 --> 00:45:54,405
yeah yeah alright we're gonna play pretty

1393
00:45:54,405 --> 00:45:55,245
sure yeah i'm trying to think of

1394
00:45:55,245 --> 00:45:56,535
the rhythm for this three because i've

1395
00:45:56,535 --> 00:45:58,065
done it an improv okay this is

1396
00:45:58,065 --> 00:46:00,435
called bad rap it's submitted by emma

1397
00:46:00,435 --> 00:46:03,945
bradshaw and we basically are going to

1398
00:46:04,005 --> 00:46:05,955
chant bad rap bad rap bad rap

1399
00:46:06,345 --> 00:46:07,425
and you're saying it's like the beastie

1400
00:46:07,425 --> 00:46:09,435
boys i think the chacko my favorite

1401
00:46:09,435 --> 00:46:09,675
shirt

1402
00:46:09,975 --> 00:46:12,375
my favorite shirt is blue and red

1403
00:46:12,495 --> 00:46:14,925
yeah right yeah right yeah she's only

1404
00:46:15,105 --> 00:46:16,785
just do it like that okay no

1405
00:46:16,785 --> 00:46:18,945
no it's definitely wrong but i think

1406
00:46:18,945 --> 00:46:20,565
we just like that because i can't

1407
00:46:20,565 --> 00:46:21,585
really figure out in my head what

1408
00:46:21,585 --> 00:46:23,415
it is my favorite color is blue

1409
00:46:23,445 --> 00:46:25,995
and red but bad rap bad yeah

1410
00:46:26,055 --> 00:46:27,405
and then the next person when i'm

1411
00:46:27,405 --> 00:46:29,835
tired i go to sleep yeah right

1412
00:46:30,255 --> 00:46:31,755
but yeah so you say a line

1413
00:46:31,755 --> 00:46:34,815
that would rhyme yeah we indeed should

1414
00:46:34,815 --> 00:46:35,925
run should run out and said you

1415
00:46:35,925 --> 00:46:37,185
change the last word now my question

1416
00:46:37,185 --> 00:46:39,045
is does the next person know i

1417
00:46:39,045 --> 00:46:40,395
think you start over a new you

1418
00:46:40,395 --> 00:46:41,925
start over anyway okay so you don't

1419
00:46:41,925 --> 00:46:43,365
have to do the rhyming with sleep

1420
00:46:43,365 --> 00:46:44,835
would be an extra added level to

1421
00:46:44,835 --> 00:46:46,215
la yeah and it also makes it

1422
00:46:46,215 --> 00:46:47,805
harder if you're the random word you

1423
00:46:47,805 --> 00:46:49,845
throw in is really weird yeah okay

1424
00:46:50,115 --> 00:46:50,865
