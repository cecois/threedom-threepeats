me to not feel like how did

159
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:10,290
we lose again and there's there's a

160
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,470
sort of meme that i'll admit i've

161
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:15,090
laughed at some of this sometimes but

162
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:15,600
the idea of

163
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:17,850
that we don't know how to we're

164
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:18,690
not going to know how to be

165
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:20,940
around each other again he was like

166
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:23,400
no we are i mean because also

167
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:25,050
we've been talking to people through our

168
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:27,780
fucking computers and you've seen people in

169
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:29,670
distanced hangs and stuff like that i

170
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:31,410
think i feel like a loser within

171
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,330
ten minutes yeah i feel like it's

172
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:35,250
a very small sliver of people who

173
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:35,760

feel free when i get in the

189
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,040
car i feel like that's when it

190
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,570
feels the most normal because you have

191
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:08,160
the most power over life and death

192
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:09,990
well i mean cause i don't have

193
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:11,730
my mask on and i can have

194
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,470
my windows down my music it feels

195
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:17,040
like a normal experience yeah well will

196
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,180

197
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:19,800
get together at some point but

198
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,930
it's inevitable i guess yeah

199
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,050
i know we're seeing each other you

00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:25,920

lauren have you been part of an

208
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:44,130
improv group that that is that touchy-feely

209
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:46,440
where you like huh you're not around

210
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:50,010
yourself up that way yeah so yeah

211
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:51,810
i definitely been part of a lot

212
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:54,330
of improv teams over the years and

213
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:59,040
there's varying degrees of ah loopy loopy

214
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:01,710
sort of stuff going on beforehand you

215
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:03,360
know what i mean it's very filter

216
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,890
like i feel like when i was

217
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:06,720
in chicago that was even more the

218
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,260
case because you were in chicago when

219
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:13,800
but like i feel like the energy

220
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,500
around improv there was even more like

221
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:20,130
this is everything kind of thing yay

222
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,130
and paul rust ah reminded me on

223
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:24,270
when he was on bang bang the

224
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:26,370
other week that when he and neil

225
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:28,890
campbell did the live show oh yeah

226
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:31,440
show us yes that um i i

227
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,210
he came backstage before the show and

228
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:35,850
caught them stretching before the show and

229
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:37,770
then i guess in my intro i

230
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:39,469
made fun of them for stretching before

231
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:41,850
show was just like you know you

232
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:43,260
get into comedy so you don't have

233
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:45,390
to stretch you know yeah i mean

234
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:46,860
i think some of those things are

235
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,360
nice just to like feel like you're

236
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:50,250
focused and are about to do something

237
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:51,600
well also if you're gonna do so

238
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,520
some physical if you're gonna move around

239
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:57,030
yeah but um i think there was

240
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,830
i did a lot more corny things

241
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:00,060
and i'm willing to do now

242
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:02,700
just what corner things are you willing

243
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:03,660
to do now what can we get

244
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:05,463
you to do right now right now

245
00:09:05,463 --> 00:09:07,380
i just look like a chicken okay

246
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:13,410
nah see it um i it was

247
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:15,120
more that i feel like now like

248
00:09:15,592 --> 00:09:17,250
you know you spend so many years

249
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:20,070

00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:23,520
weekly improv practice and then for each

251
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,080
team that you're on and then at

252
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,610
a certain point you kind of go

253
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,522
i think we're good enough to not

254
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,940
do that anymore yeah and then that

255
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,530
feels amazing and then you're like why

256
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:33,150

257
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:34,860

259
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:38,640
that way too that that because ah

260
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:41,640
you know i've got into improv relatively

261
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:45,090
late but there are some some people

262
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:47,130
in the seventies when i was in

263
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:48,540
myself when you yes and you've been

264
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:48,720
aged

265
00:09:48,794 --> 00:09:52,110
backwards ever say yes bb benji bucks

266
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:57,240
so um but thank you pause so

267
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:58,890
i was part of benjamin buttons you

268
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:00,360
just had a really nice but it

269
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,040
everyone's like yeah the aging thing but

270
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,270
like i mean have you seen the

271
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:04,920
movie when he does have a nice

272
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:07,530
but at one point wow

273
00:10:08,786 --> 00:10:08,960
yeah

274
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:13,790
old so um some groups i've noticed

275
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:17,210
that some people ah it people that

276
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:20,300
i don't improvise with often or have

277
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,520
only like improvise with one time are

278
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:24,800
people that tend to do warm up

279
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,090
so they want to do like a

280
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:27,860
little scenes before a show or something

281
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,570
and this is people they maybe it's

282
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:30,110
because of the

283
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:32,030
presence of me because they all know

284
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:33,890
each other but i always get the

285
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:35,450
impression like oh no they do this

286
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:39,230
before every show whereas i don't i

287
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:40,880
don't do that because i first of

288
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,070
all i never learned those were right

289
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,350
but also can't learn them anymore yeah

290
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:48,380
but also knows july to your baby

291
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,000
but i just wanted to escalate

292
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,915
yeah but it's not like like there's

293
00:10:52,915 --> 00:10:53,960
some two legs

294
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:56,923
to learn it learning

295
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:00,650
but things like vocal exercises i think

296
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,480
still have a use no matter how

297
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,060
long you've been doing a thing um

298
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:06,740
whether it's singing or acting if you

299
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:08,990
do like your tongue twisters and shit

300
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:10,910
like that like i get that to

301
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:13,340
to to make sure that you're you're

302
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:15,230
limber you know with your with your

303
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:17,450
mouth on stage and the singing of

304
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:18,110
course you got to lose

305
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:20,300
listen up your make your your throws

306
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,560
in tune i mean you are making

307
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,300
me think that like there are moments

308
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:25,490
where like you're with a team and

309
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:26,360
you haven't seen each other in a

310
00:11:26,362 --> 00:11:27,620
while and then like you're kind of

311
00:11:27,624 --> 00:11:29,360
on different pages where like it would

312
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,600
be helpful to center yourself yeah and

313
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,980
kind of like check-in and go like

314
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:36,290
cheerios rice krispies

315
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:38,900
first way you got jumped into the

316
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:41,720
proud boys did they did they say

317
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:44,570
that or that's fairly that's like ah

318
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,250
one of the initiation things as you

319
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:47,450
have to name a bunch of cereals

320
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:48,650
while guys are beating the shit out

321
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:52,460
oh yeah why would anyone out i

322
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:55,820
found that i that i need to

323
00:11:56,210 --> 00:11:57,467
say if i'm i'm

324
00:11:57,470 --> 00:11:59,300
about to have a really uncomfortable conversation

325
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:01,700
with someone i need to say the

326
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:03,920
words out loud for the first time

327
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,680
before i talked to them because you

328
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:09,680
know how you know how like that's

329
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,900
why cool up stop touching my stuff

330
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:15,080
by which and then you and my

331
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:18,140
bedroom door coolum i want to watch

332
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:19,700
tv my show tonight

333
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:22,700
no but you know how how you

334
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:23,900
know that's why you go to therapy

335
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,070
so you can say stuff out loud

336
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:27,320
for the first time because if you

337
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,910
don't you keep it inside or whatever

338
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:30,984
but um you know the whole thing

339
00:12:30,984 --> 00:12:32,750
is if it's never even mentioned able

340
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:33,980
it's manageable you know what i mean

341
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:36,260
like like a lot of a lot

342
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:39,080
of people who have really bad problems

343
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,910
just like internalize everything right so

344
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:42,200
so but i found that i need

345
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,280
to if i'm about to have an

346
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,020
uncomfortable conversation with someone where i need

347
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:47,510
to like you know lower the boom

348
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:49,430
and i'm not great at confrontation you

349
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:50,480
know what i mean i need to

350
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,420
like practicing it out loud because if

351
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:54,740
i don't the first time i say

352
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:57,230
it out loud will be like filled

353
00:12:57,230 --> 00:12:59,750
with emotion you know so you are

354
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,040
like those scenes in movies

355
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:02,630
that i do not like where somebody

356
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:02,930
is

357
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:06,260
practicing a big speech in the mirror

358
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:07,580
not in the mirror i just need

359
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:10,460
to like literally say you're fired no

360
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:13,190
no no say different your your wires

361
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:17,090
well i think that's helpful too because

362
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:20,060
sometimes if i just think about something

363
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:21,620
that i wanna say i like forget

364
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:23,810
all my points by the time i'm

365
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:27,170
actually having the conversation yeah like if

366
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:29,120
you like on the few instances where

367
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,680
i've had to fire a manager for

368
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,210
instance you know what i mean and

369
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:33,140
and i've been with them for a

370
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:34,430
long time yeah

371
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:36,380

00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:10,940
to watch it after like all that

417
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,890
that stuff happened when it originally happened

418
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:13,940
when we were all hearing about it

419
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:18,530
and it's it's absolutely insane like you

420
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:19,910
i watched the first twenty minutes that

421
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:21,020
movie i was like this is just

00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:29,330
it because i'm like yeah next you'll

427
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:30,920

00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:45,230
how things are

436
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:46,550
different like you don't watch it going

437
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:47,270
like oh wow

438
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:50,180

439
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:51,290
happen you just kind of watch it

440
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:52,820
going like oh and nineteen seventy nine

441
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:54,771
yeah that's what that's why it's not

442
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:55,550
golden

443
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:58,880
wow i don't even a good question

444
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:02,420
we didn't get age of consent until

445
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:06,050
nineteen ninety nine yeah weird lincoln park

446
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,280
came out with their album they're like

447
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,230
we gotta get age of consent going

448
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:13,100
on so age of consent laws started

449
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:17,300
in the eighteen hundreds yes were you

450
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:19,635
fact checking me lauren i'm actually just

451
00:16:19,635 --> 00:16:20,270
wanting to know

452
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,430
and eighteen thirty the age of consent

453
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:24,140
for marriage was raised eighteen years old

454
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:26,810
for males and sixteen females premier okay

455
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:30,230
um that's so gross it's crazy that

456
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:32,210
people got married when they were fourteen

457
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:33,840
it's crazy that people still get married

458
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:35,630
therefore that's so crazy that people get

459
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:36,890
married i'll just reduce it down to

460
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:39,890
this it's an archaic institution it means

461
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:40,370
nothing

462
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:43,070

467
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:54,560

people back thirty years

479
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:18,710

480
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:21,050
younger even just in like no people

481
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:23,600

482
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,060
older now but i just why why

00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:30,500
i know no one i own this

486
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:32,630

00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:53,990
at like one fifty yeah ooh seems

498
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:54,590
reasonable

00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:58,130
you know but like like i if

500
00:17:58,130 --> 00:17:59,990
people start living to two hundred do

501
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:02,930
you think the whole conception of marriage

502
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:04,520
will start to go away i mean

503
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:07,640
especially with like alimony and stuff like

504
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:10,280
can you imagine getting marrying melinda gates

505
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:12,710
for like one hundred years yeah can

506
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:15,710

years i mean i'm sure we know

510
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:22,970
by now but i am curious how

511
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:24,259
much money melinda gates is going to

512
00:18:24,259 --> 00:18:26,503

513
00:18:26,503 --> 00:18:27,380
in the box

514
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:31,700

00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:33,020
rich right yeah

516
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,170
they they were just too poor people

517
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:38,810
who are selling malaria together and then

518
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,160
he said figure out ways to get

519
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:40,370
around

520
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:41,870
yeah

521
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:44,510
how can we track everyone on earth

522
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:48,350
we got a trick i'm somehow well

523
00:18:48,357 --> 00:18:51,950
i'll admit a serum it is crazy

524
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:54,860
like i clicked on a tweet about

525
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:57,050
them divorcing and i read some comments

526
00:18:57,050 --> 00:18:58,700
underneath it which i shouldn't do but

527
00:18:58,700 --> 00:18:59,510
it was all like

528
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:03,590
like these people finally getting what is

529
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:05,810
coming to them and finally satan

530
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:09,440
is is getting it's come up and

531
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:11,541
and like i'm like because they're getting

532
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:13,340
a divorce i think it's probably fine

533
00:19:13,670 --> 00:19:15,080
like what are they saying must be

534
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:17,120
okay harrassed well first of all they

535
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,310
think they like they're focusing on the

536
00:19:19,310 --> 00:19:21,650
wrong thing like everyone kind of i

537
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:22,880
feel like has agreed at a certain

538
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,140
point that getting divorced is a good

539
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:26,510
thing so it's like he's probably have

540
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:28,640
being the time of his life oh

541
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,100

00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:09,230
raya and she unmatched thinking he was

558
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:10,730
fake and then he sent her a

559
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:12,380
message and then she sent her an

560
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:13,550
instagram instagram

561
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:16,740
yeah an app yes a video message

562
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:19,650
and then join match me thence me

563
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:21,150
and that but then she played it

564
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:23,370
she played this private message i just

565
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:25,260
felt mortified for him i thought that

566
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:27,630
was mortifying i agree i mean and

567
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:28,439
you know it was for her because

568
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,430
he said her name and and she

569
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:30,750
had a very specific name and he

570
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:32,190
put a lot into it he put

571
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:33,720
a lot and he put alive he

572
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:34,290
was really sure

573
00:20:34,841 --> 00:20:37,080
honestly was flirting in the videos yeah

574
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:39,210
it was supposed to be hot and

575
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:41,100
i felt concerned about it and i

576
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:42,900
felt kind of i felt so i

577
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,730
felt like i was too personal like

578
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:46,590
i just knew too much i don't

579
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,000
think that should be allowed

580
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,700
well i think if someone sends you

581
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,500
a video that's the whole thing right

582
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:53,580
i mean it's just like how does

583
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:55,890
anyone die thankfully i was done with

584
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:59,370
dating before all of this stuff was

585
00:20:59,370 --> 00:21:01,530
invented but it's i sound incredibly old

586
00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:03,510
but i but yeah just how how

587
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:05,910
could anyone ever especially if you're famous

588
00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:08,250
how could you ever say like okay

589
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:08,928
i'm gonna send

590
00:21:09,249 --> 00:21:10,740
i feel like i would just retreat

591
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:12,540
into a cocoon and never date anyone

592
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,520
ever again i said yeah it does

593
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,320
seem really hard i think about that

594
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,850
a lot like people that are that

595
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:20,730
level of fame that but it's also

596
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:23,220
like well you gotta factor that in

597
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:24,570
when you do things you know what

598
00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:26,469
i mean like i've been like wasn't

599
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:29,076
you do armageddon you gotta factor in

600
00:21:29,076 --> 00:21:29,220
that

601
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:31,470
at some point someone's gonna buy less

602
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:34,050
likely factor but if you're if you're

603
00:21:34,050 --> 00:21:35,820
ben affleck who

604
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:41,790

00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:54,210
that same message right like and it

610
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:55,500
was just like why did you unfriend

612
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:00,120

have to prove it's me because no

618
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:10,590
one would think it was me but

619
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:14,400

621
00:22:16,890 --> 00:22:17,370

644
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:05,220
of reference instead of our tiny yeah

645
00:23:05,670 --> 00:23:06,810

00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:09,510
seeing gwyneth paltrow on the oscars referred

647
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:12,390
to anthony hopkins does anthony hopkins because

648
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:13,980
that's how people pronounce it over there

649
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:15,330
and it's like come on lady that

650
00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:17,400
should be as embarrassing as ben affleck

651
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,290
sending that video absolutely

652
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,400
one hundred percent we should bring it

653
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,520
back bring back that video but i

654
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:27,150
just hate who will listen the culture

655
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:28,710
yeah i feel like they did let's

656
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:30,870
see why not let's say they did

657
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:34,140
but i think you know how it's

658
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:35,670
we were talking on the last episode

yeah remember their centre record a phone

662
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:47,700

thirteen and shouldn't jack bauer he twenty

664
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,860
four big kids shouldn't it be illegal

665
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:54,840
to post someone's video message at some

666
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,640
point especially if they're famous yeah i

um yeah but ben affleck i've i

680
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:38,490
you know i read some people talking

681
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:39,420
about it and they're all like what

682
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:40,860
a creep and i was just like

683
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:42,420
man i feel bad for him out

684
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:43,680
of and i feel i feel like

685
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,690
she shouldn't have done that yeah i

686
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:46,740
know what you mean i don't i

687
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:48,360
don't think it was well laura what

688
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,170
do you say it was it was

689
00:24:49,170 --> 00:24:50,640
it creepy or was it just like

690
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:51,600
okay dude

691
00:24:51,930 --> 00:24:53,040
well to me it was a little

692
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:55,050
creepy i felt unsettled by the video

693
00:24:55,050 --> 00:24:57,120
itself yeah but i also understood definitely

694
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,710
by how turned on your i feel

695
00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:00,480
like i feel like it definitely did

696
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,130
not come off the way he intended

697
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:03,420
it to come know and she's much

698
00:25:03,450 --> 00:25:04,890
younger than him so that's also part

699
00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:06,360
of what makes it yeah weird like

700
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:07,800
you're like why is he doing this

701
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,240
like yeah so why did he find

702
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,555
me on another app which is like

703
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:12,000
kind of a difficult thing to do

704
00:25:12,090 --> 00:25:13,050
if you don't have the last name

705
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:14,460
of the person it's like there's just

706
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:15,810
like a lot about it that feels

707
00:25:15,810 --> 00:25:17,820
kind of how over the top really

708
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:19,050
well but it's a little bit that's

709
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:20,370
what you're listening oh it's so difficult

710
00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:21,930
to find but it's okay maybe not

711
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:24,450
difficult but same but it's invasive to

712
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:26,220
then send a message like the person

713
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:29,280
unmatched yo so then it you're assuming

714
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:31,230
it's because you are but it was

715
00:25:31,770 --> 00:25:32,010
but

716
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:33,660
oh but you're assuming the match because

717
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:35,100
they don't know that it's you and

718
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,480
that was true she said it was

719
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,920
true she said that's why she did

720
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,210
it yeah she said yeah unmatched him

721
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:40,200
because she didn't think it was the

722
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,610
real ben affleck okay well so he

723
00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:43,110
guessed right but i'm still seeing what's

724
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:44,220
happened to him all the time there's

725
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:46,350
something a little creepy about it that

726
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:49,200
being said i still think like i

727
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,940
would be delighted that happened like i

728
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:52,410
don't think like would be

729
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:54,090
i think it's this that i'm seeing

730
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:56,040
it as internet crash yeah because it

731
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:58,230
becomes hilarious when to take because when

732
00:25:58,230 --> 00:25:59,820
you when you are in possession of

733
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:01,620
ah of something like that it has

734
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:03,840
value to give you like internet fame

735
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,640
for one day and she did yeah

736
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:07,590
and she she made us all laugh

737
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:09,570
at ben affleck for one day great

738
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:11,670
and we'll ever see her again

739
00:26:12,690 --> 00:26:15,450

a blanket

795
00:28:10,530 --> 00:28:12,600
that is like a sort of pho

796
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:15,330
furry blanket that is folded at the

797
00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:17,160
foot of the bed that we pull

798
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:20,070
up at night sometimes you will sleep

799
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:21,570
on top of the duvet for a

800
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:22,530
nap you'll sleep on top of the

801
00:28:22,530 --> 00:28:25,710
dovey under that fuzzy blander that fuzzy

802
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:28,020
that sounds comfortable it is it's really

803
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:30,180
nice i think a nap i can

804
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:30,540
do it on

805
00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:33,570
the couch with no blankets that usually

806
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,310
it just at some point my brain

807
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:36,840
shuts down it goes you need to

808
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,190
be asleep right now and we'll just

809
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:40,860
like fall asleep wherever i am so

810
00:28:40,890 --> 00:28:42,540
that'll be on the couch sometimes and

811
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:44,340
i can do it without a blanket

812
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:45,780
but there's nothing better than an app

813
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:47,520
where you just like it's basically just

814
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:48,960
going back to bed but for only

815
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,370
an eighth of the time that's the

816
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:50,730
thing because

817
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,200
i have to really make a play

818
00:28:52,213 --> 00:28:53,700
i have to really put myself into

819
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:55,620
the headspace of i'm gonna fall asleep

820
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:56,880
because otherwise i feel like i should

821
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,080
get up and do something even if

822
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,056
i'm really really tired real snoozing i

823
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:02,190
have to emi sound machine i turned

824
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:03,570
on my sound machine i put on

825
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:06,090
my the rain gets a mask sometime

826
00:29:06,099 --> 00:29:09,030
anyway but i'm asking around just loud

827
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:09,510
as hell

828
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:13,590
and then i fall asleep for me

829
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:14,790
it's like if i'm at that point

830
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:15,480
where i have to take a nap

831
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:17,370
i'm very tired and so it's i

832
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:18,990
the the only thing i have to

833
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:20,820
do really is to stop looking at

834
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:23,370
my phone and just lay there and

835
00:29:23,370 --> 00:29:24,600
let my mind go and then i'll

836
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:25,980
fall asleep but i always set an

837
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:28,350
alarm i don't like because i don't

838
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:30,750
it's not good to everybody yeah

839
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:31,800
and it's not good to take naps

840
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,840
for too long like there's a certain

841
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,150
amount of time that's like i think

842
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:38,610
over a half hours too long really

843
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:41,190
i'm gonna yeah really like like an

844
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:42,900
hour because i think i have about

845
00:29:43,050 --> 00:29:44,220
it takes me a while to wind

846
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:47,070
down mentally and then because i don't

847
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:48,270
i never you know i've never liked

848
00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:49,620

00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:50,880

857
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:10,260

big long beard

859
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:15,390
there's there's too much happening in my

860
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:18,240
house ah in terms of dogs barking

861
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,890
or people ringing the doorbell or what

862
00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:21,270
have you that i need the sound

863
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:23,820

if suddenly i finally drift off to

865
00:30:27,390 --> 00:30:29,820

866
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:31,470
the dogs barking at someone who's come

867
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:33,450

00:30:34,275 --> 00:30:36,255
that like oh i was just leaves

those dogs they make me angry yeah

870
00:30:38,925 --> 00:30:41,056
um does your dog above the law

871
00:30:41,056 --> 00:30:42,255
and does your dog bark a lot

872
00:30:42,915 --> 00:30:44,835
i'm only when someone's at the door

873
00:30:44,955 --> 00:30:46,875
okay and then she goes fucking nuts

874
00:30:46,875 --> 00:30:47,175
and check

875
00:30:49,125 --> 00:30:51,795
they also stout i'm it when i'm

876
00:30:51,795 --> 00:30:54,255
walking them and we see the mail

of their car or some wow and

880
00:31:00,765 --> 00:31:02,295
so they bark at that like usually

881
00:31:02,295 --> 00:31:03,375
they don't bark at anyone on the

882
00:31:03,375 --> 00:31:04,755
street but if it is like an

883
00:31:04,755 --> 00:31:07,665
amazon person drives up to someone's house

884
00:31:08,175 --> 00:31:08,415

885
00:31:08,445 --> 00:31:10,305

886
00:31:10,665 --> 00:31:12,105

889
00:31:16,125 --> 00:31:17,355
saying that's why i say to george

890
00:31:17,355 --> 00:31:19,395
i'm like georgia we look what he's

891
00:31:19,455 --> 00:31:21,555
pretty smart though nothing's but i mean

892
00:31:21,555 --> 00:31:23,955
here's the thing nothing bad ever happens

893
00:31:23,955 --> 00:31:27,165
come on remember this dogs like what

894
00:31:27,165 --> 00:31:28,605

the dog started barking like crazy wow

924
00:32:33,915 --> 00:32:36,015
just remember what happened the first time

925
00:32:37,575 --> 00:32:39,230
i wonder why i don't know how

926
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:41,085
they i don't remember how they learned

927
00:32:41,085 --> 00:32:42,315
that huh

928
00:32:43,215 --> 00:32:44,625

929
00:32:44,625 --> 00:32:46,125
error thing of like what made the

930
00:32:46,125 --> 00:32:47,835

932
00:32:52,215 --> 00:32:53,655
you must erase that knowledge from your

933
00:32:53,655 --> 00:32:56,655
brain it's not it's observing you maybe

934
00:32:57,315 --> 00:32:58,695

946
00:33:28,845 --> 00:33:31,575

so different i was like who is

949
00:33:34,005 --> 00:33:36,495
that so different than michael douglas yes

950
00:33:37,212 --> 00:33:38,835
used it to his advantage so how

951
00:33:38,835 --> 00:33:40,965
many movies of his i've seen is

952
00:33:40,965 --> 00:33:43,275
seinfeld one long movie yep

953
00:33:44,265 --> 00:33:45,255
seventy one

954
00:33:46,515 --> 00:33:48,075
would you yeah you've already been around

955
00:33:48,075 --> 00:33:49,215
for a long time yeah it's gotta

956
00:33:49,215 --> 00:33:50,685
be younger he was way older than

957
00:33:50,715 --> 00:33:52,155
everybody else in the cast yeah he

958
00:33:52,155 --> 00:33:54,105
was on the tv show fridays it

959
00:33:54,105 --> 00:33:57,285
was eight seventy one no fucking chance

960
00:33:58,005 --> 00:34:01,335
fuck gee you shut your fucking mouth

961
00:34:01,665 --> 00:34:04,725
it was me he's actually seven okay

962
00:34:04,725 --> 00:34:05,985
he's not that much younger dance

963
00:34:07,875 --> 00:34:10,875
i'm surprised i didn't realize that they

964
00:34:10,875 --> 00:34:12,375
were that much older i guess what

965
00:34:12,375 --> 00:34:14,595
does michael douglas had to enter as

966
00:34:14,595 --> 00:34:16,365
kramer and do the slide and sort

967
00:34:16,365 --> 00:34:19,665
of like stopping i would love it

968
00:34:20,235 --> 00:34:21,615
i bet he'd be okay at it

969
00:34:21,615 --> 00:34:23,061
because he's a good actor writer is

970
00:34:23,693 --> 00:34:25,035
the only good at his thing

971
00:34:26,715 --> 00:34:28,365
i mean he's not a chameleon although

972
00:34:28,365 --> 00:34:30,075
he did play liberace in that one

973
00:34:30,075 --> 00:34:31,665

yeah he's very he's very much who

978
00:34:40,575 --> 00:34:42,615

yeah but he's he's one of those

980
00:34:44,265 --> 00:34:45,375
people and maybe we talked about this

981
00:34:45,375 --> 00:34:45,975
before

982
00:34:46,875 --> 00:34:48,585
where he is like i feel like

983
00:34:48,585 --> 00:34:50,925
in the eighties he was considered like

984
00:34:50,925 --> 00:34:53,355
really hot but it's also like yeah

985
00:34:53,415 --> 00:34:54,975
you'd see him in like you know

986
00:34:55,065 --> 00:34:57,195
doing like ninety minutes pop up and

987
00:34:57,195 --> 00:34:59,625
scripts where that people would write where

988
00:34:59,625 --> 00:35:02,055
they're like young girls talking about like

989
00:35:02,085 --> 00:35:03,585
oh well if only he looked like

990
00:35:03,585 --> 00:35:06,285
michael douglas and you go right yeah

991
00:35:06,525 --> 00:35:08,535
two year old is writing this i

993
00:35:11,025 --> 00:35:12,465
of hot man i guess but let's

994
00:35:12,735 --> 00:35:14,282
google michael douglas young maybe i'm wrong

995
00:35:14,282 --> 00:35:15,945
i'm talking about i mean in this

996
00:35:16,155 --> 00:35:17,805
streets of san francisco and everything use

997
00:35:17,816 --> 00:35:19,365
like sort of a heartthrob i would

998
00:35:19,365 --> 00:35:22,095
choose handsome yeah yeah he's actually he's

999
00:35:22,095 --> 00:35:26,685
bay comedy okay by mcgill fan

1000
00:35:26,685 --> 00:35:28,815
and my predators are my findings michael

1001
00:35:28,815 --> 00:35:31,035
douglas is gay because i like my

1002
00:35:31,035 --> 00:35:33,511
whole life he's been old yeah that's

1003
00:35:33,525 --> 00:35:35,895
the thing is like it's surprising when

1004
00:35:35,895 --> 00:35:37,215
someone who your whole life has been

1005
00:35:37,215 --> 00:35:40,005
old you realize you see a picture

1006
00:35:40,005 --> 00:35:41,745
of them from ten years before you

1007
00:35:42,555 --> 00:35:43,965
you know knew who they were and

1008
00:35:43,965 --> 00:35:45,855
they're like gorges or like katherine hepburn

1009
00:35:45,855 --> 00:35:46,785
was always like that for me

1010
00:35:46,845 --> 00:35:48,285
cause oh yeah in the eighties she

1011
00:35:48,285 --> 00:35:50,535
was always like hey i'm katherine hepburn

1012
00:35:50,655 --> 00:35:52,755
yeah and then you see her like

1013
00:35:52,755 --> 00:35:55,545
in the thirties and you're like dash

1014
00:35:55,545 --> 00:35:59,325
of dead bang but she aged really

1015
00:35:59,325 --> 00:36:02,715
well like her face is like you

1016
00:36:02,715 --> 00:36:03,945
know when you look at her i

1017
00:36:03,945 --> 00:36:05,445
don't know that's that to me is

1018
00:36:05,535 --> 00:36:07,005
i don't i know i'm

1019
00:36:07,035 --> 00:36:09,915
not that she'll still looks great she's

1020
00:36:09,975 --> 00:36:11,895
and considering she's dead yeah when you

1021
00:36:11,895 --> 00:36:13,455
go to work grave and digger ups

1022
00:36:14,235 --> 00:36:16,065

she's so amazing and those old movies

1053
00:37:17,505 --> 00:37:20,265
yeah she's ah and you know what

1054
00:37:20,445 --> 00:37:21,645
i have to confess

1055
00:37:23,115 --> 00:37:25,005
anytime i watched something like i've been

1056
00:37:25,005 --> 00:37:28,155
watching the next generation or you know

1057
00:37:28,155 --> 00:37:29,475
all this all the old star treks

1058
00:37:29,475 --> 00:37:30,945
or whatever and an actual come up

1059
00:37:30,945 --> 00:37:32,415
that i recognize i'll go on their

1060
00:37:32,415 --> 00:37:35,085
wikipedia page and see what they're up

1061
00:37:35,085 --> 00:37:38,775
to lately and if anyone is divorced

1062
00:37:38,805 --> 00:37:39,705
i get sad

1063
00:37:41,445 --> 00:37:43,065
but like i don't know i don't

1064
00:37:43,065 --> 00:37:44,265
know what it is about them but

1065
00:37:44,265 --> 00:37:47,085
when i see like she got married

1066
00:37:47,085 --> 00:37:49,185
in nineteen ninety one they were divorced

1067
00:37:49,185 --> 00:37:50,925
in nineteen ninety five i go oh

1068
00:37:52,245 --> 00:37:54,315
it seems to me that doesn't do

1069
00:37:54,315 --> 00:37:56,625
anything because i guess i've been divorced

1070
00:37:56,625 --> 00:37:57,465
but i feel like it's just like

1071
00:37:57,495 --> 00:37:59,565
oh cool i just knew oh i

1072
00:37:59,625 --> 00:38:01,755
don't i feel really bad for especially

1073
00:38:01,755 --> 00:38:03,615
if they never remarried like they got

1074
00:38:03,615 --> 00:38:05,325
divorced at ninety in ninety five and

1075
00:38:05,355 --> 00:38:07,605
yeah married it's like i wonder about

1076
00:38:07,605 --> 00:38:09,105
that but i feel like it's what's

1077
00:38:09,105 --> 00:38:10,545
worse when you see like their spouse

1078
00:38:10,545 --> 00:38:12,285
died or something and they're like yeah

1079
00:38:12,315 --> 00:38:14,775
that's very sad i do think a

1080
00:38:14,775 --> 00:38:17,445
lot of people that get divorced don't

1081
00:38:17,445 --> 00:38:19,575
get remarried like they i think i've

1082
00:38:19,935 --> 00:38:21,525
there's many people i've known who are

1083
00:38:21,525 --> 00:38:22,995
like yeah marriage is not for me

1084
00:38:22,995 --> 00:38:25,185
i realised like right that wasn't something

1085
00:38:25,185 --> 00:38:27,555
i wanted to do um you know

1086
00:38:27,765 --> 00:38:29,325
i i've know a lot of people

1087
00:38:29,325 --> 00:38:30,825
that have gotten divorced and remarried but

1088
00:38:30,825 --> 00:38:31,905
i think i feel like you know

1089
00:38:31,911 --> 00:38:32,445
just as men

1090
00:38:32,445 --> 00:38:34,845
me that never did again because their

1091
00:38:34,875 --> 00:38:37,095
their marriage their initial marriage was like

1092
00:38:37,935 --> 00:38:39,795
it was not in their nature to

1093
00:38:39,795 --> 00:38:42,195
be in a relationship like that and

1094
00:38:42,195 --> 00:38:44,565
then they they unfortunately found out the

1095
00:38:44,565 --> 00:38:46,755
hard way and so did their spouse

1096
00:38:47,115 --> 00:38:50,715
um you know my starter marriage um

1097
00:38:51,525 --> 00:38:52,605
with cool up is

1098
00:38:52,725 --> 00:38:56,925
ah almost over displays going great but

1099
00:38:59,295 --> 00:39:01,125
um i don't know i don't know

1100
00:39:01,125 --> 00:39:02,205
what it is and i know it's

1101
00:39:02,205 --> 00:39:03,705
irrational but when i look up someone's

1102
00:39:03,705 --> 00:39:05,385
wikipedia page and i see a divorce

yeah mozzie feminazi sorry

1204
00:42:59,525 --> 00:43:01,925
a femi nazi yeah that's a terrible

1205
00:43:01,925 --> 00:43:04,775
term that people use to anyone who's

1206
00:43:04,775 --> 00:43:06,155
a feminist you never heard that before

1207
00:43:06,215 --> 00:43:08,423
oh oh no i have you know

1208
00:43:08,435 --> 00:43:09,845
it's so weird i i of course

1209
00:43:09,845 --> 00:43:11,825
i've heard that but i then thought

1210
00:43:11,885 --> 00:43:15,575
immediately of oscar hours because for the

1211
00:43:15,575 --> 00:43:17,765
family view femme bots but i don't

1212
00:43:17,765 --> 00:43:18,095
know

1213
00:43:18,215 --> 00:43:19,775
did you know that align between the

1214
00:43:19,865 --> 00:43:21,335
modern feminazi is very thin

1215
00:43:22,895 --> 00:43:24,755
as the poet say but you know

1216
00:43:24,785 --> 00:43:27,515
that femme bots were originally a thing

1217
00:43:27,515 --> 00:43:29,405
that were on the six million dollar

1218
00:43:29,405 --> 00:43:32,465
man i assumed that kind of thing

1219
00:43:32,495 --> 00:43:34,325
yeah um oh no relation it would

1220
00:43:34,325 --> 00:43:35,885
probably be the seven million dollar man

1221
00:43:35,885 --> 00:43:38,975
now oh yeah i probably you know

1222
00:43:38,975 --> 00:43:39,995
i saw that movie when i was

1223
00:43:39,995 --> 00:43:40,925
a kid though i don't think i

1224
00:43:40,925 --> 00:43:42,695
probably got ninety percent of the acts

1225
00:43:42,695 --> 00:43:44,615
lol jokes like i only you know

1226
00:43:44,615 --> 00:43:45,575
i got the jokes where it was

1227
00:43:45,575 --> 00:43:48,155
like he's backing up the you know

1228
00:43:48,155 --> 00:43:49,685
he's gonna run them over previous his

1229
00:43:49,985 --> 00:43:53,315
and yes this fruit is his dick

1230
00:43:54,005 --> 00:43:55,117
that kind of thing just walking down

1231
00:43:55,117 --> 00:43:56,525
the stairs behind a couch that kind

1232
00:43:56,525 --> 00:43:58,055
of thing i don't think that femme

1233
00:43:58,055 --> 00:43:59,525
bots were necessarily a reference to the

1234
00:43:59,525 --> 00:44:02,165
six million dollar man because the femme

1235
00:44:02,165 --> 00:44:02,855
bots in austin

1236
00:44:02,855 --> 00:44:05,075
in powers were a very specific thing

1237
00:44:05,585 --> 00:44:07,716
and in six million and six million

1238
00:44:07,716 --> 00:44:08,735
and they they didn't make any other

1239
00:44:08,735 --> 00:44:10,115
reference to the six million dollar man

1240
00:44:10,535 --> 00:44:11,945
which why would they it was not

1241
00:44:12,125 --> 00:44:14,045
it was yeah part of that genre

1242
00:44:14,045 --> 00:44:16,175
that just he wasn't spoofing six million

1243
00:44:16,175 --> 00:44:17,645
dollar man no they just they just

1244
00:44:17,645 --> 00:44:19,775
stole that name either stole the name

1245
00:44:19,775 --> 00:44:21,335
or came up with it independently because

1246
00:44:21,335 --> 00:44:22,985
they they weren't oh parallels

1247
00:44:23,045 --> 00:44:25,745
thinking huh yeah yeah here we go

1248
00:44:25,745 --> 00:44:26,825
and it's and it's not pair of

1249
00:44:26,975 --> 00:44:28,805
parallel and its you know the seventy

1250
00:44:28,805 --> 00:44:30,425
s vs the ninety this is what

1251
00:44:30,425 --> 00:44:32,075
i'm saying the seven was first so

1252
00:44:32,090 --> 00:44:33,575
it was a time traveler though

1253
00:44:34,867 --> 00:44:36,725
stoically he came up with it first

1254
00:44:36,875 --> 00:44:38,915
no because he was he was frozen

1255
00:44:38,915 --> 00:44:41,105
before this big six million dollar man

1256
00:44:41,135 --> 00:44:43,505
premiered yeah that's what i'm saying so

1257
00:44:43,505 --> 00:44:44,855
he didn't come up with it first

1258
00:44:46,925 --> 00:44:49,535
okay right yeah i just remember that

1259
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:51,365
part of it you don't remember him

1260
00:44:51,365 --> 00:44:54,485
being frozen not really it was probably

1261
00:44:54,485 --> 00:44:55,595
a scary movie for you when you

1262
00:44:55,595 --> 00:44:57,155
were a kid right yeah i'm still

1263
00:44:57,275 --> 00:45:00,695

1300
00:46:33,575 --> 00:46:36,155
i was over zoom and sometimes lauren

1301
00:46:36,185 --> 00:46:37,955
you can tell when she's in research

1302
00:46:37,955 --> 00:46:40,475
mode or right now i'm just staring

1303
00:46:41,585 --> 00:46:43,745
this was admitted by brad albrecht to

1304
00:46:43,775 --> 00:46:46,355
customers attempt to befuddle their server with

1305
00:46:46,355 --> 00:46:50,195
an increasingly elaborate meal order so basically

1306
00:46:50,195 --> 00:46:52,505
two people are eating at a restaurant

1307
00:46:52,505 --> 00:46:55,595
one person's the server after the introductions

1308
00:46:55,595 --> 00:46:58,175
we begin the the people eating begin

1309
00:46:58,175 --> 00:47:00,395
with a straightforward restaurant order which the

1310
00:47:00,395 --> 00:47:01,655
server has to repeat back

1311
00:47:01,685 --> 00:47:05,555
flawlessly then we jump into chump change

1312
00:47:05,555 --> 00:47:07,265
the order and make it even more

1313
00:47:07,265 --> 00:47:08,975
complicated the server has to repeat it

1314
00:47:08,975 --> 00:47:11,825
back flawlessly and it continues on until

1315
00:47:11,825 --> 00:47:13,895
the server does not repeat it back

1316
00:47:13,895 --> 00:47:15,035
flawlessly enough

1317
00:47:16,085 --> 00:47:18,335
the end scott i'm sorry to break

1318
00:47:18,335 --> 00:47:19,715
