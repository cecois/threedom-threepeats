579
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:51,950
better business plan all your data is

580
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:53,810
already uploaded to a remote server do

581
00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:54,830
not try to contact me

582
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:57,890
various security devices will not help you

583
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:00,890
formatting a disk or destroying adviser not

584
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:03,050
helped by the way since your data

585
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:04,340
something is making it longer but i

586
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:05,750
can't put my finger on it by

587
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:06,980
the way edit these down if you're

588
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:09,110
going to send these sensor data around

589
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:10,190
like if this is one of my

590
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:11,900
ripping things i've ever read no honestly

591
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,400
it is because it's crazy how it

592
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,990
he's really threatening you yes

593
00:20:15,625 --> 00:20:16,705
and no way of getting out of

594
00:20:16,705 --> 00:20:18,745
this ah so what are you gonna

595
00:20:18,745 --> 00:20:20,335
do you're gonna send my automatic disk

596
00:20:20,335 --> 00:20:21,625
or destroying device will not help either

597
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:22,615
since your data is already on a

598
00:20:22,615 --> 00:20:25,015
remote server yeah i get it this

599
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:26,995

00:25:07,345 --> 00:25:09,745
five times what yeah that is five

739
00:25:09,745 --> 00:25:10,916
times too many that when i worked

740
00:25:10,917 --> 00:25:12,385
at the video store i remember seeing

741
00:25:12,385 --> 00:25:13,525
forrest gump that was like you know

742
00:25:13,525 --> 00:25:15,685
people barely know see and i think

743
00:25:15,685 --> 00:25:17,545
our age difference there i like thought

744
00:25:17,545 --> 00:25:18,895
it was great yeah here you were

745
00:25:18,895 --> 00:25:21,326
stupid yeah yes but i feel like

746
00:25:21,326 --> 00:25:21,475
a

747
00:25:21,715 --> 00:25:23,875
a big difference in ages is some

748
00:25:23,875 --> 00:25:25,521
hanks come on freedom a thing you

749
00:25:25,735 --> 00:25:26,965
do think if i were your age

750
00:25:26,965 --> 00:25:27,835
at the time i would have made

751
00:25:27,835 --> 00:25:29,215
fun of it yes yeah but i

752
00:25:29,215 --> 00:25:32,425
think a generational thing is like younger

753
00:25:32,455 --> 00:25:34,345
people i feel like people younger than

754
00:25:34,345 --> 00:25:36,565
me if they liked to thing once

755
00:25:36,565 --> 00:25:39,355
they like it forever totally don't think

756
00:25:39,565 --> 00:25:41,785
that's generation generationally that's not true

757
00:25:42,235 --> 00:25:44,395
you're saying or just i think i'm

758
00:25:44,395 --> 00:25:45,625
saying i look back at the things

759
00:25:45,625 --> 00:25:46,375
that i liked when i was a

760
00:25:46,375 --> 00:25:48,025
kid and you up and i say

761
00:25:48,055 --> 00:25:49,645
oh that sucks i know i remember

762
00:25:49,645 --> 00:25:51,385
that be good again and remember when

763
00:25:51,385 --> 00:25:52,973
i watched scooby doo episode and i

764
00:25:52,973 --> 00:25:54,355
was like wait a minute this shows

765
00:25:54,355 --> 00:25:57,265
terrible cheapest fucking thing yeah but i

766
00:25:57,265 --> 00:25:59,545
loved it of course last newly i

767
00:25:59,545 --> 00:26:00,745
feel like we had so much fun

768
00:26:00,745 --> 00:26:01,345
being like

769
00:26:02,305 --> 00:26:04,795
forest room now that is fine i

770
00:26:04,811 --> 00:26:06,025
would do that on the playground of

771
00:26:06,055 --> 00:26:08,695
course i just think someone pretended braces

772
00:26:08,695 --> 00:26:10,315
and then run out of them yeah

773
00:26:11,545 --> 00:26:13,885
well what made him ran a um

774
00:26:13,915 --> 00:26:16,165
what made him from content are some

775
00:26:16,165 --> 00:26:17,635
though the people were chasing him i

776
00:26:17,635 --> 00:26:20,305
think he was being taunted to shreds

777
00:26:20,305 --> 00:26:21,895
and he had to run just taunted

778
00:26:23,185 --> 00:26:24,415

though we need to be talking about

810
00:27:34,195 --> 00:27:36,385

811
00:27:36,385 --> 00:27:38,785
of scots topics yeah this the topic

812
00:27:38,785 --> 00:27:41,185
is jay moore movie mafia i think

813
00:27:41,215 --> 00:27:43,987
you're using it for yeah i think

814
00:27:43,987 --> 00:27:45,835

815
00:27:45,835 --> 00:27:49,045
topic let's go scott do you think

816
00:27:49,045 --> 00:27:49,225
he is

817
00:27:49,458 --> 00:27:51,173
genius i think he did it morin

818
00:27:51,173 --> 00:27:52,855
mafia i gotta look this yeah yes

819
00:27:53,215 --> 00:27:55,765

00:28:03,175 --> 00:28:04,885
could because they had to fill one

825
00:28:04,886 --> 00:28:06,415
was like however many paid for it

826
00:28:06,445 --> 00:28:07,555

828
00:28:08,875 --> 00:28:09,325

yes wow i like this mess but

874
00:29:40,045 --> 00:29:41,545
i actually didn't know that song and

875
00:29:41,545 --> 00:29:44,395
it came into my spotify rotation and

876
00:29:44,395 --> 00:29:45,115
then i was like oh i love

877
00:29:45,115 --> 00:29:47,005
this and then i was like what

878
00:29:47,065 --> 00:29:48,715
and i finally was like yo fine

879
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:49,945
oh my now

880
00:29:49,975 --> 00:29:51,625
i'm like i need to know what

881
00:29:51,625 --> 00:29:52,975
would set that off so i have

882
00:29:53,005 --> 00:29:55,315
anything going data data data i know

883
00:29:55,315 --> 00:29:56,455
but i'm like one two three four

884
00:29:56,455 --> 00:29:58,615
five six seven eight if anything in

885
00:29:58,615 --> 00:30:00,265
that rhythm that falls in that rhythm

886
00:30:00,295 --> 00:30:01,645
and it's very it's a very specific

887
00:30:01,675 --> 00:30:03,565
thing i can't think of anything you

888
00:30:03,565 --> 00:30:05,605
know it's not necessarily a number of

889
00:30:05,605 --> 00:30:07,675
syllables although it has to be that

890
00:30:07,675 --> 00:30:09,415
number of syllables you hear it and

891
00:30:09,415 --> 00:30:09,810
you know

892
00:30:10,105 --> 00:30:12,505
it has to be the emphasis of

893
00:30:12,625 --> 00:30:14,575
like the way you read a collection

894
00:30:14,575 --> 00:30:16,705
of words if it scans yes that

895
00:30:16,705 --> 00:30:19,075
that that that data i can't wait

896
00:30:19,255 --> 00:30:21,171
to happen but ah well that's how

897
00:30:21,171 --> 00:30:22,585
i know because you could take over

898
00:30:22,585 --> 00:30:24,115
the no part if it's just that

899
00:30:24,115 --> 00:30:25,645
debt debt debt data you would go

900
00:30:25,645 --> 00:30:27,505
i know that's true you know what

901
00:30:27,505 --> 00:30:29,365
scott you're writing i can't wait to

hear one because

903
00:30:30,875 --> 00:30:32,435

or knew i know siri yeah right

905
00:30:35,825 --> 00:30:38,015
there i just did it okay that's

906
00:30:38,015 --> 00:30:39,157
amazing well i guess

907
00:30:40,235 --> 00:30:42,785
okay so we have wasted scots topic

908
00:30:42,785 --> 00:30:44,495

00:37:56,765 --> 00:37:58,565
started years and years ago we would

1105
00:37:58,565 --> 00:38:01,145
get twenty fifty one hundred no way

1106
00:38:01,145 --> 00:38:02,225
we get we would get a lot

1107
00:38:02,225 --> 00:38:03,485
of a lot of eggs and and

1108
00:38:03,485 --> 00:38:04,805
they were wasting them they were putting

1109
00:38:04,805 --> 00:38:06,245
in like two at a time and

1110
00:38:06,245 --> 00:38:07,145
three at a time and going like

1111
00:38:07,145 --> 00:38:08,165
oh that didn't work well that's true

1112
00:38:08,195 --> 00:38:10,115
you have a lot of acei so

1113
00:38:10,115 --> 00:38:12,005
by the end of this whole thing

1114
00:38:12,005 --> 00:38:13,055
when we finally went to the new

1115
00:38:13,055 --> 00:38:14,825
doctor we were

1116
00:38:15,275 --> 00:38:16,415
pull up went through two rounds of

1117
00:38:16,415 --> 00:38:19,115
ivf is shy identity as well and

1118
00:38:19,115 --> 00:38:20,765
it is not easy to a point

1119
00:38:20,765 --> 00:38:23,435
where she was crying one day going

1120
00:38:23,435 --> 00:38:25,085
i don't know what's wrong with me

1121
00:38:25,085 --> 00:38:26,855
and i was calling the doctors and

1122
00:38:26,855 --> 00:38:28,925
they're saying it's the it's the hormones

1123
00:38:28,955 --> 00:38:31,265
ancient and she's like can i stop

1124
00:38:31,265 --> 00:38:32,945
and they're like you can't unless you'll

1125
00:38:32,945 --> 00:38:35,375
just have to start over so she

1126
00:38:35,435 --> 00:38:37,295
just going through major depression anyway so

1127
00:38:37,295 --> 00:38:39,455
we aren't so i drained my balls

1128
00:38:39,485 --> 00:38:40,055
going through

1129
00:38:41,645 --> 00:38:44,402
just press oh he's not the same

1130
00:38:44,435 --> 00:38:46,145
mr hugh this was when i stopped

1131
00:38:46,175 --> 00:38:47,945
i mean just kid with this

1132
00:38:49,325 --> 00:38:50,885
and there's good coffee but the litecoins

1133
00:38:50,885 --> 00:38:51,485
are adding

1134
00:38:53,285 --> 00:38:55,505
expecting the episodes were doing so many

1135
00:38:55,505 --> 00:38:59,105
shots shots shots shots shots shots um

1136
00:38:59,525 --> 00:39:01,895
trigger shots areas i'm just getting looking

1137
00:39:02,435 --> 00:39:03,785
if you've gone through it you know

1138
00:39:03,785 --> 00:39:05,495
just how brutal it can be absolutely

1139
00:39:05,525 --> 00:39:06,935
anyway so at the end of like

1140
00:39:06,935 --> 00:39:09,725
several more rounds and me doing this

1141
00:39:09,725 --> 00:39:11,165
operate we we both she did a

1142
00:39:11,165 --> 00:39:12,845
retrieval and i did this operation at

1143
00:39:12,875 --> 00:39:14,135
the same time we were in two

1144
00:39:14,135 --> 00:39:17,499
separate rooms ah she famously heard like

1145
00:39:17,499 --> 00:39:19,985
hell say oh that's right she famously

1146
00:39:19,985 --> 00:39:21,815
heard them say get the smelling salts

1147
00:39:21,815 --> 00:39:23,015
because i was about to pass out

1148
00:39:23,045 --> 00:39:25,085
the smelling salts um i want to

1149
00:39:25,085 --> 00:39:26,405
say that and i was like oh

1150
00:39:26,405 --> 00:39:27,815
right now guess the selling itself yeah

1151
00:39:27,845 --> 00:39:28,925
because this is so boring

1152
00:39:29,465 --> 00:39:31,715
um sure but not boring at all

1153
00:39:31,985 --> 00:39:33,395
anyway so we finally were able to

1154
00:39:33,395 --> 00:39:35,495
get one little board we were just

1155
00:39:35,495 --> 00:39:36,695
able to get one no this is

1156
00:39:36,815 --> 00:39:40,265
where it gets interesting well good they're

1157
00:39:40,269 --> 00:39:41,315
able to eat were able to get

1158
00:39:41,315 --> 00:39:44,165
one egg egg thing

1159
00:39:45,605 --> 00:39:47,135
well you made an embryo an embryo

1160
00:39:47,135 --> 00:39:48,815
yes and we end and out of

1161
00:39:48,815 --> 00:39:50,285
all the ones they tet like maybe

1162
00:39:50,285 --> 00:39:51,785
we had two and they tested and

1163
00:39:51,815 --> 00:39:53,495
three were bad but we we had

1164
00:39:53,495 --> 00:39:55,985
one viable one ah now they want

1165
00:39:55,985 --> 00:39:58,235
you to have two because it cannot

1166
00:39:58,235 --> 00:40:00,365
work out but collect did not want

1167
00:40:00,365 --> 00:40:01,745
to go through the ibf again because

1168
00:40:01,745 --> 00:40:03,785
i feel like shit did it ten

1169
00:40:03,785 --> 00:40:04,595
to fifteen

1170
00:40:05,706 --> 00:40:07,775
this brings havoc on the bod yes

1171
00:40:07,805 --> 00:40:09,485
so she's like please i don't want

1172
00:40:09,485 --> 00:40:11,675
to do this again so then then

1173
00:40:11,675 --> 00:40:14,615
we ah our doctor said okay you

1174
00:40:14,675 --> 00:40:16,835
need to do this via surrogate because

1175
00:40:16,895 --> 00:40:19,445
ah because what happened you are ah

1176
00:40:19,475 --> 00:40:21,635
you cannot have a baby cool up

1177
00:40:21,635 --> 00:40:23,735
so we then went through the process

1178
00:40:23,735 --> 00:40:25,265
of getting a surrogate and that was

1179
00:40:25,295 --> 00:40:25,595
and this

1180
00:40:25,595 --> 00:40:28,475
it was right ah this was in

1181
00:40:28,475 --> 00:40:32,635
twenty twenty node twenty twenty twenty two

1182
00:40:33,035 --> 00:40:35,375
fifteen twenty twenty twenty one because the

1183
00:40:35,525 --> 00:40:37,484
the vaccine had just come out ah

1184
00:40:37,985 --> 00:40:41,045
so ah we had to zoom with

1185
00:40:41,045 --> 00:40:42,515
all these surrogates we actually got a

1186
00:40:42,515 --> 00:40:45,725
surrogate who was like

1187
00:40:46,423 --> 00:40:47,335
deal was you have to get the

1188
00:40:47,335 --> 00:40:50,695
covered vaccine before we do this because

1189
00:40:50,695 --> 00:40:52,255
we only have one we don't want

1190
00:40:52,525 --> 00:40:54,025
you know something come of it and

1191
00:40:54,115 --> 00:40:55,855
so we got one ah who was

1192
00:40:55,855 --> 00:40:56,935
like yeah yeah i'll get the co

1193
00:40:56,955 --> 00:40:59,245
vaccine and then yeah yeah for the

1194
00:40:59,245 --> 00:41:01,045
next two months they say like that

1195
00:41:01,045 --> 00:41:02,845
that's a red flag yeah for sure

1196
00:41:02,905 --> 00:41:05,275
i'll get the covert vaccine how do

1197
00:41:05,275 --> 00:41:06,535
you say that coke ko ko

1198
00:41:06,775 --> 00:41:09,205
isaac kevin um so for the next

1199
00:41:09,205 --> 00:41:11,515
two months while lee were you know

1200
00:41:11,515 --> 00:41:13,105
like settling everything and she was going

1201
00:41:13,105 --> 00:41:15,055
through the the doctor stuff that we

1202
00:41:15,055 --> 00:41:16,135
were paying for and all that kind

1203
00:41:16,135 --> 00:41:18,902
of shot ah she kept like everyone's

1204
00:41:18,902 --> 00:41:20,485
smuggling but what if i didn't get

1205
00:41:20,485 --> 00:41:21,985
the co vaccine we were like oh

1206
00:41:21,985 --> 00:41:23,605
yeah yeah because after all it's a

1207
00:41:23,605 --> 00:41:26,395
rule yeah and then finally right as

1208
00:41:26,395 --> 00:41:26,665
we were

1209
00:41:26,695 --> 00:41:28,195
signing it she's like look i'm going

1210
00:41:28,195 --> 00:41:29,755
to be honest i ain't getting this

1211
00:41:29,755 --> 00:41:31,675
cove vaccine well you know what that

1212
00:41:31,675 --> 00:41:33,655
was such a blessing it was great

1213
00:41:33,655 --> 00:41:35,005
worked out the way it was supposed

1214
00:41:35,005 --> 00:41:37,525
to it was great because whatever that

1215
00:41:37,525 --> 00:41:39,175
seemed like a bad situation and then

1216
00:41:39,175 --> 00:41:42,295
we quite quickly got our the woman

1217
00:41:42,295 --> 00:41:43,495
who turned out to be our surrogate

1218
00:41:43,495 --> 00:41:46,555
who was amazing yeah and so i

1219
00:41:46,555 --> 00:41:46,735
go

1220
00:41:46,915 --> 00:41:48,325
seen every morning you didn't you ended

1221
00:41:48,325 --> 00:41:49,735
up with somebody where you didn't have

1222
00:41:49,735 --> 00:41:51,925
to wonder you know yeah he's communicative

1223
00:41:51,925 --> 00:41:53,635
person she was great we really really

1224
00:41:53,635 --> 00:41:56,335
like her and her husband and so

1225
00:41:56,605 --> 00:41:58,465
this was her sixth baby her third

1226
00:41:58,465 --> 00:42:01,465
surrogacy wow it's so amazing amazing thing

1227
00:42:01,465 --> 00:42:05,061
to do yeah and she ah it

1228
00:42:05,095 --> 00:42:07,015
was really good i mean we you

1229
00:42:07,015 --> 00:42:09,835
no ah we got off tour paul

1230
00:42:09,835 --> 00:42:13,135
and i got off tour and i

1231
00:42:13,165 --> 00:42:15,475
thought i had one month until because

1232
00:42:15,475 --> 00:42:18,115
she said i'm giving birth on october

1233
00:42:18,115 --> 00:42:20,005
first probably because i have in every

1234
00:42:20,005 --> 00:42:21,805
other pregnancy and that's kind of my

1235
00:42:21,805 --> 00:42:23,575
fault because i kept reiterating that to

1236
00:42:23,575 --> 00:42:25,735
scott yeah that i was like you

1237
00:42:25,915 --> 00:42:27,115
says you have one

1238
00:42:27,175 --> 00:42:29,395
month yeah yeah um yeah i don't

1239
00:42:29,395 --> 00:42:30,565
mean that she would give birth on

1240
00:42:30,565 --> 00:42:32,425
october first i mean that that many

1241
00:42:32,425 --> 00:42:33,805
weeks in that many days yeah so

1242
00:42:33,805 --> 00:42:35,425
she she was like october versus the

1243
00:42:35,425 --> 00:42:37,645
target date so so we did that

1244
00:42:37,645 --> 00:42:39,415
tour and i was kinda like oh

1245
00:42:39,415 --> 00:42:41,515
okay a month leeway that'll be good

1246
00:42:41,845 --> 00:42:44,905
literally the plane landed when we got

1247
00:42:44,905 --> 00:42:47,005
back and the surrogate texted and said

1248
00:42:47,725 --> 00:42:50,245
my mucus plug just dropped yes um

1249
00:42:50,245 --> 00:42:51,895
which i said disgusting yeah i hope

1250
00:42:51,895 --> 00:42:53,935
so later a thumbs-down to my six

1251
00:42:53,935 --> 00:42:55,675
p m i yeah don't you want

1252
00:42:55,675 --> 00:42:57,325
to get deal with that you know

1253
00:42:57,325 --> 00:42:59,215
the way i never heard that before

1254
00:42:59,215 --> 00:43:01,165
in my life my mucus plug just

1255
00:43:01,165 --> 00:43:03,115
dropped well why would you yeah well

1256
00:43:03,205 --> 00:43:05,455
because intuition would you be you here

1257
00:43:05,545 --> 00:43:07,495
you know you know it's interest

1258
00:43:07,495 --> 00:43:09,565
eating um i got a first date

1259
00:43:09,805 --> 00:43:12,650
i'm doing something with leadership i'm doing

1260
00:43:12,655 --> 00:43:14,545
something i can't talk about but it's

1261
00:43:14,545 --> 00:43:16,195
mentioned and it's like i wonder if

1262
00:43:16,195 --> 00:43:17,785
it's if it's maybe or will it

1263
00:43:17,785 --> 00:43:19,105
be that thing of like what's that

1264
00:43:19,105 --> 00:43:20,665
thing where the mandela effect or something

1265
00:43:20,665 --> 00:43:22,345
where like you oh yeah barry chambers

1266
00:43:22,645 --> 00:43:25,975
was that mandela effects that's the that's

1267
00:43:25,975 --> 00:43:27,325
the one of the prime examples of

1268
00:43:27,325 --> 00:43:27,655
the mendez

1269
00:43:27,655 --> 00:43:29,185
l effect you think it is something

1270
00:43:29,185 --> 00:43:30,535
but it's not something it ever was

1271
00:43:30,565 --> 00:43:32,155
yes because i think you understand this

1272
00:43:32,155 --> 00:43:33,205
is something the wrong thing there's a

1273
00:43:33,415 --> 00:43:35,215
what's the word for when you hear

1274
00:43:35,215 --> 00:43:37,015
something and then you start seeing it

1275
00:43:37,015 --> 00:43:39,295
everywhere and it's like oh right i

1276
00:43:39,295 --> 00:43:40,525
forget what the thing but i know

1277
00:43:40,525 --> 00:43:40,855
what you mean

1278
00:43:42,535 --> 00:43:44,785
yeah but anyway maybe you're now that

1279
00:43:44,785 --> 00:43:46,675
you've heard it now you'll see everyone

1280
00:43:46,675 --> 00:43:49,525
talking about it that's weird anyway but

1281
00:43:50,095 --> 00:43:52,465
so so that happened on uncle's blog

1282
00:43:52,495 --> 00:43:54,895
and that can't happen on september first

1304
00:44:32,155 --> 00:44:33,955
forms a seal to prevent bacteria and

1305
00:44:33,955 --> 00:44:35,605
infection from getting into your uterus and

1306
00:44:35,605 --> 00:44:37,045
reaching your baby think of it as

1307
00:44:37,045 --> 00:44:38,575
a barrier between your vagina and your

1308
00:44:38,575 --> 00:44:40,285
uterus where your baby is for most

1309
00:44:40,855 --> 00:44:42,535

00:45:29,965 --> 00:45:31,405
this news and and then it became

1335
00:45:31,405 --> 00:45:32,455
a race of like i was like

1336
00:45:32,455 --> 00:45:33,715
oh i have a month to like

1337
00:45:33,715 --> 00:45:36,317
record two months worth worth of podcasts

1338
00:45:36,325 --> 00:45:38,185
that's gonna take robot

1339
00:45:39,025 --> 00:45:40,045
you have a lot of podcast so

1340
00:45:40,045 --> 00:45:41,965
became it became a race to like

1341
00:45:41,965 --> 00:45:43,825
record everything so we would like you

1342
00:45:43,825 --> 00:45:46,071
vs that mucus plug yeah sure but

1343
00:45:46,071 --> 00:45:47,605
she was gone shannon i would do

1344
00:45:47,605 --> 00:45:50,125
several yeah it started several scary movies

1345
00:45:50,125 --> 00:45:53,215
a day right um anyway so so

1346
00:45:53,215 --> 00:45:57,265
then it took another month like but

1347
00:45:57,265 --> 00:45:59,095
basically to basically two weeks later

1348
00:45:59,365 --> 00:46:01,285
to say she said were three centimeters

1349
00:46:01,310 --> 00:46:04,465
i'm three centimeters and she lives in

1350
00:46:04,465 --> 00:46:05,995
riverside by the way which riverside is

1351
00:46:05,995 --> 00:46:08,875
close but if there's traffic just fucking

1352
00:46:08,905 --> 00:46:10,135
too it's just far enough where it's

1353
00:46:10,135 --> 00:46:12,385
like a two hour if there's really

1354
00:46:12,385 --> 00:46:14,215
bad traffic maybe a little bit longer

1355
00:46:14,215 --> 00:46:15,445
which would suck if like it's like

1356
00:46:15,445 --> 00:46:17,185
hey my water just broke and then

1357
00:46:17,185 --> 00:46:18,865
we missed the whole thing right saying

1358
00:46:18,895 --> 00:46:19,255
so

1359
00:46:19,345 --> 00:46:22,334
so we were like three centimeters and

1360
00:46:22,334 --> 00:46:24,115
we could probably like we were we

1361
00:46:24,115 --> 00:46:25,615
were gonna go in a week yeah

1362
00:46:26,065 --> 00:46:28,285

1364
00:46:32,095 --> 00:46:36,295

01:05:29,175 --> 01:05:30,375
as i was talking i would do

1941
01:05:30,375 --> 01:05:31,898
it better if i really focused high

1942
01:05:31,898 --> 01:05:34,395

1948
01:05:48,435 --> 01:05:50,475
it's very strange the numbers i accepted

1949
01:05:50,475 --> 01:05:52,425
impression you know i'm be curious to

1950
01:05:52,425 --> 01:05:54,075
hear that yeah everybody who does it

1951
01:05:54,075 --> 01:05:55,425
sounds the same and i'm like i

1952
01:05:55,425 --> 01:05:56,775
guess that's what i said it's only

1953
01:05:56,775 --> 01:05:58,935
when your hello interesting thing you you

1954
01:05:58,935 --> 01:05:59,955
have a hard day stay

1955
01:05:59,955 --> 01:06:02,145
they say they seize on a specific

1956
01:06:02,145 --> 01:06:03,825
thing yeah yeah from your sanity to

1957
01:06:03,855 --> 01:06:05,655
fuckin do it yeah yeah i think

1958
01:06:05,655 --> 01:06:06,555

1959
01:06:09,105 --> 01:06:11,175
yeah i don't like the friend group

1960
01:06:12,735 --> 01:06:14,955
i knew i meant i was starting

1961
01:06:14,955 --> 01:06:16,455
to understand how an impression can be

1962
01:06:16,485 --> 01:06:18,255
done yeah alright sometimes i think there

1963
01:06:18,255 --> 01:06:20,235
is no impression there and because you're

1964
01:06:20,235 --> 01:06:22,455
like that's just how he is and

1965
01:06:22,455 --> 01:06:23,565
then you're like oh if i really

1966
01:06:23,565 --> 01:06:25,905
wasn't impressionist i guess i'd really focus

1967
01:06:25,905 --> 01:06:27,435
up and take something and pull it

1968
01:06:27,435 --> 01:06:28,185
and extrapolate

1969
01:06:29,535 --> 01:06:31,995

the idea it's not exactly a flaw

2033
01:08:48,705 --> 01:08:50,085
in the arc it's a little extra

2034
01:08:50,115 --> 01:08:51,825
annex i have i built in sort

2035
01:08:51,825 --> 01:08:52,965
of as a window seat that i

2036
01:08:52,965 --> 01:08:56,175
realized should be used by a animals

2037
01:08:56,175 --> 01:08:56,531
some sort

2038
01:08:56,685 --> 01:08:58,605
okay well we won't be giving up

01:08:58,605 --> 01:09:00,165
your window scene for one of you's

2040
01:09:00,165 --> 01:09:02,715
you to continue population unless we blend

2041
01:09:02,715 --> 01:09:04,755

i'm not carrying a lot of weight

2087
01:10:31,545 --> 01:10:33,075
but that's not even proportional to your

2088
01:10:33,075 --> 01:10:34,125
body but no it's like

2089
01:10:34,545 --> 01:10:37,035
like a gigantic regular yield yeah on

2090
01:10:37,035 --> 01:10:39,675

out of you yes i think it's

2103
01:11:05,355 --> 01:11:07,065
about how the future of the animals

2104
01:11:07,065 --> 01:11:09,225
sort of survive and change but what

2105
01:11:09,225 --> 01:11:10,241
i want to know is what do

2106
01:11:10,241 --> 01:11:11,565
you bring to the table talent wise

2125
01:11:40,130 --> 01:11:42,200
it out on the floorboards here okay

2126
01:11:42,200 --> 01:11:43,100
so you do a little bit of

2127
01:11:43,100 --> 01:11:47,060
a wow that's me counting i love

2128
01:11:47,090 --> 01:11:49,040
how many was out for you know

2129
01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:51,110
what's amazing about that theory you have

2130
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:52,790
hands and you couldn't count on your

2131
01:11:52,790 --> 01:11:54,320
fingers but yet you chose to sit

2132
01:11:54,327 --> 01:11:55,820
that's exactly right i

2133
01:11:55,820 --> 01:11:57,200
i can't i don't really use my

2134
01:11:57,200 --> 01:12:00,320
fingers because my head is so tiny

2135
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:02,750
up there i can't really see oil

2136
01:12:02,780 --> 01:12:04,790
and you have skies and i do

2137
01:12:04,790 --> 01:12:06,200
have size so it's hard for me

2138
01:12:06,200 --> 01:12:07,970
to see what i'm counting to look

2139
01:12:07,970 --> 01:12:09,980
um i gotta say this eel his

2140
01:12:09,980 --> 01:12:11,990
head is so small he sleeps twenty

2141
01:12:11,990 --> 01:12:13,220
three hours of the day because his

2142
01:12:13,220 --> 01:12:14,750
brain is so small he can't even

2143
01:12:14,750 --> 01:12:15,980
stay awake only

2144
01:12:16,010 --> 01:12:17,810
my head sleeps but the rest of

2145
01:12:17,810 --> 01:12:19,663
me is walking around like you are

2146
01:12:19,670 --> 01:12:21,650

thing headless horse man right i'm a

2149
01:12:27,438 --> 01:12:28,940
whatever i've never realised he's a good

2150
01:12:29,150 --> 01:12:31,700
heavy what about the headless horsewoman well

2151
01:12:31,700 --> 01:12:33,385

here's a question for you this is

2159
01:12:43,850 --> 01:12:44,750
a little bit of a test and

2160
01:12:44,840 --> 01:12:45,980
okay if i want to make a

2161
01:12:45,980 --> 01:12:47,360

2175
01:13:10,850 --> 01:13:12,230
years yeah when he says it's a

2176
01:13:12,230 --> 01:13:14,360

trenchcoat snowshoe i make a horseshoe here's

2191
01:13:43,370 --> 01:13:45,860
how we make a horseman i'm already

2192
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:47,930

2193
01:13:47,930 --> 01:13:50,810
horse i put a bag over my

2194
01:13:50,810 --> 01:13:53,120

2195
01:13:54,050 --> 01:13:55,190
none of that gets in there

2196
01:13:56,330 --> 01:13:57,830
so far up there like your amp

2197
01:13:57,830 --> 01:14:00,230
you'd like to see what lauding well

2198
01:14:00,230 --> 01:14:01,790
i mean that's just for me but

2199
01:14:01,790 --> 01:14:04,820
it also prevents any eel from getting

2200
01:14:04,820 --> 01:14:06,890
in there use the smallest part that's

2201
01:14:06,890 --> 01:14:08,660
faster than your plan i'm just worried

2202
01:14:08,660 --> 01:14:10,700
you're gonna have like a now four

2203
01:14:10,730 --> 01:14:12,620
of like if he has sex with

2204
01:14:12,860 --> 01:14:14,450
anything else that's not a horse man

2205
01:14:14,450 --> 01:14:15,800
or an eel then suddenly you have

2206
01:14:15,980 --> 01:14:16,460
a thing with

2207
01:14:16,490 --> 01:14:18,050
for different things inside of it this

2208
01:14:18,050 --> 01:14:18,860
is just like

2209
01:14:20,210 --> 01:14:21,470
then then you have to build an

2210
01:14:21,470 --> 01:14:23,750
another arch dick and five arms or

2211
01:14:23,750 --> 01:14:25,580
five legs yeah which is kind of

2212
01:14:25,580 --> 01:14:26,870

01:14:26,870 --> 01:14:28,700
