170
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,420

332
00:10:45,565 --> 00:10:47,755

336
00:10:52,855 --> 00:10:54,535
though is is it like the ocean

337
00:10:54,535 --> 00:10:56,065
or you know what knows the river

338
00:10:56,785 --> 00:10:59,215
that's probably lonely but it leads into

339
00:10:59,215 --> 00:11:00,505
the ocean because i'll say when we

340
00:11:00,505 --> 00:11:02,065

00:11:02,095 --> 00:11:03,745
we went to venice well the yeah

342
00:11:03,775 --> 00:11:05,785
the great thing about flying into venice

343
00:11:06,235 --> 00:11:08,425
it's so fun is you you touch

344
00:11:08,455 --> 00:11:09,895
down at the airport and then you

345
00:11:10,135 --> 00:11:11,545
instead of taking a taxi to the

346
00:11:11,545 --> 00:11:12,655
hotel you have to take a water

347
00:11:12,655 --> 00:11:14,875
taxi fun which is very very fun

348
00:11:14,905 --> 00:11:16,315
and didn't feel choppy to me they're

349
00:11:16,315 --> 00:11:17,965
going fast enough where it's like they're

350
00:11:17,965 --> 00:11:19,945
just skimming over the big choppy stuff

351
00:11:20,035 --> 00:11:21,655
right and it's short enough for whatever

352
00:11:21,655 --> 00:11:22,255
it was like twenty

353
00:11:22,286 --> 00:11:23,455
minutes or whatever then i was like

354
00:11:23,455 --> 00:11:24,775

that are really old and just like

474
00:15:18,655 --> 00:15:20,183
tucked between all the buildings just like

475
00:15:20,183 --> 00:15:21,025
the ones you see on the way

476
00:15:21,025 --> 00:15:23,065

really old yeah those are interesting they're

480
00:15:29,605 --> 00:15:31,735
interesting we need to have them i

481
00:15:31,735 --> 00:15:33,085
always i think there should be some

482
00:15:33,115 --> 00:15:35,095
element of history that's history

483
00:15:36,205 --> 00:15:37,615
but it's all history but you know

484
00:15:37,735 --> 00:15:40,615
i like in an old church you'll

485
00:15:40,615 --> 00:15:42,475
see like i like brave searches in

486
00:15:42,475 --> 00:15:44,455
manhattan as well and there's so old

487
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:46,405
that the grandma first dust

488
00:15:48,295 --> 00:15:51,355
oh they that even the inscription has

489
00:15:51,355 --> 00:15:53,185
worn away and it's just like this

490
00:15:53,185 --> 00:15:55,945
green moscow oh yeah right and it's

491
00:15:55,945 --> 00:15:57,325
like what are we doing now that

492
00:15:57,325 --> 00:15:58,855
feels weird it's also interesting it just

493
00:15:58,855 --> 00:16:01,045
feels like hocus pocus or something but

494
00:16:01,045 --> 00:16:02,425
i think like don't you think it

495
00:16:02,425 --> 00:16:03,325
should be but i think we don't

496
00:16:03,325 --> 00:16:05,125
want years after but you're putting the

497
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:07,615
ground they recite along that's not long

498
00:16:07,615 --> 00:16:09,625
yeah but you know that if they

499
00:16:09,625 --> 00:16:11,245
took out the cemeteries in manhattan they

500
00:16:11,245 --> 00:16:13,255
would just build some ugly condo like

501
00:16:13,255 --> 00:16:14,395
know what you need you need at

502
00:16:14,395 --> 00:16:15,385
least a building that's going to be

503
00:16:15,385 --> 00:16:18,115
like historically interesting or like or what

504
00:16:18,145 --> 00:16:19,615
i'm saying what if they didn't just

505
00:16:19,615 --> 00:16:21,595
build an ugly condo they built like

506
00:16:22,195 --> 00:16:24,505
a beautiful condo yeah of course i

507
00:16:24,505 --> 00:16:26,245
want to work the homeless i'm not

508
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:27,775
i'm not arguing against that

509
00:16:27,775 --> 00:16:29,245
that i'm just saying but i also

510
00:16:29,245 --> 00:16:30,895
think we can do that in general

511
00:16:30,955 --> 00:16:33,385
yeah i don't think that you're you're

512
00:16:33,385 --> 00:16:35,905
a nimby what's that not in my

513
00:16:35,905 --> 00:16:38,395
backyard oh god no i'm saying like

514
00:16:38,545 --> 00:16:40,285
how about just anywhere where there's a

515
00:16:40,285 --> 00:16:42,055
building they just do that anywhere there's

516
00:16:42,055 --> 00:16:44,515
a building vibrating i honestly launched this

517
00:16:44,515 --> 00:16:46,461
un what do we do we are

518
00:16:46,465 --> 00:16:47,935
using no one to sit

519
00:16:47,935 --> 00:16:49,659
sport and housed know that part i

520
00:16:50,365 --> 00:16:52,225
but you're saying anywhere there's a building

521
00:16:52,645 --> 00:16:53,725
you like anywhere you can build a

522
00:16:53,725 --> 00:16:55,075
new building could be one of those

523
00:16:55,075 --> 00:16:56,245
so why do we want to want

524
00:16:57,175 --> 00:16:58,915
help what do you call it affordable

525
00:16:58,915 --> 00:17:01,765
housing oh yeah okay what how did

526
00:17:01,765 --> 00:17:03,555
we get aware which building you say

527
00:17:03,595 --> 00:17:06,535
turned down um a tear down for

528
00:17:06,535 --> 00:17:08,095
what oh there's so many ugly buildings

529
00:17:08,185 --> 00:17:09,775
that way i mean what's the first

530
00:17:09,835 --> 00:17:12,055
building the us building so this is

531
00:17:12,055 --> 00:17:14,755
good because it it inspires or gives

532
00:17:14,755 --> 00:17:16,495
incentive to people who own buildings to

533
00:17:16,495 --> 00:17:18,655
make them look nice yeah i think

534
00:17:18,685 --> 00:17:20,785
here i have a very different argument

535
00:17:20,845 --> 00:17:22,855
of about building things and i wouldn't

536
00:17:22,885 --> 00:17:24,715
manhattan which i think has a lot

537
00:17:24,715 --> 00:17:27,505
more historical like the aisle about value

538
00:17:27,985 --> 00:17:28,156
but

539
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:30,145
here i think that architecture is um

540
00:17:30,175 --> 00:17:32,605
ninety percent really bad and from like

541
00:17:32,605 --> 00:17:34,285
nineteen sixty or nineteen ninety and it's

542
00:17:34,285 --> 00:17:37,015
like really ugly and frightening of architecture

543
00:17:37,045 --> 00:17:40,135
yeah historical value and los angeles when

544
00:17:40,135 --> 00:17:42,055
i'm visiting my sister here in nineteen

545
00:17:42,055 --> 00:17:44,245

547
00:17:45,511 --> 00:17:46,915
about a story i'm just putting into

548
00:17:47,455 --> 00:17:48,265
perspective for me

549
00:17:48,415 --> 00:17:49,855

550
00:17:49,885 --> 00:17:51,025

00:18:37,525 --> 00:18:39,205
like a little old mexican i know

573
00:18:39,235 --> 00:18:41,065
you're trying to get anything kind of

574
00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:41,588
just makes

575
00:18:45,235 --> 00:18:48,069
it's like a little mexican town along

576
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:50,935
a street in downtown yeah oh it's

577
00:18:50,935 --> 00:18:53,185
ah olvera street a vera stream yeah

578
00:18:53,935 --> 00:18:55,765
and so the famously this try with

579
00:18:55,765 --> 00:18:59,515
sandy lane sandy lee famously the street

580
00:18:59,515 --> 00:19:01,675
to i had any name a major

581
00:19:01,675 --> 00:19:02,275
ah

582
00:19:03,355 --> 00:19:05,545
tejano music festival on the ny cool

583
00:19:05,545 --> 00:19:07,315
up and i got married yeah we

584
00:19:07,315 --> 00:19:08,961
were supposed to be married outside yes

585
00:19:08,961 --> 00:19:10,255
yes had to move it inside because

586
00:19:10,255 --> 00:19:12,535
loud blaring yes when we were i

587
00:19:12,535 --> 00:19:13,675
remember when jane and i were pulling

588
00:19:13,675 --> 00:19:14,785
up to that and we heard the

589
00:19:14,785 --> 00:19:16,465
music were like what's oh this is

590
00:19:16,885 --> 00:19:18,175
yeah wait do you think you'll be

591
00:19:18,175 --> 00:19:19,855
able to hear it now we moved

592
00:19:19,855 --> 00:19:22,975
everything inside and cool ups cry

593
00:19:22,975 --> 00:19:25,195
crying because we planned everything and then

594
00:19:25,195 --> 00:19:26,938
it turned out so much better because

595
00:19:26,938 --> 00:19:28,855
she's great she got to make an

596
00:19:28,885 --> 00:19:32,005
entrance for that giant circular staircase it

597
00:19:32,005 --> 00:19:33,055
was beautiful i never yeah it was

598
00:19:33,055 --> 00:19:34,225
great there's just so much better it's

599
00:19:34,228 --> 00:19:35,665
why they say when one door closes

600
00:19:35,935 --> 00:19:37,645
but closing you have to go inside

601
00:19:38,249 --> 00:19:39,775
you have to get in there um

602
00:19:39,925 --> 00:19:42,025
ah so so they had ah like

603
00:19:42,025 --> 00:19:43,135
ah ah an adult

604
00:19:43,135 --> 00:19:45,835
obi um it might not have been

605
00:19:45,895 --> 00:19:47,395
olvera street might have been another part

606
00:19:47,395 --> 00:19:49,105
of town okay describing because i've been

607
00:19:49,105 --> 00:19:51,055

i e spilling it upon the ground

748
00:24:42,370 --> 00:24:45,100
ah the purpose of sex is to

749
00:24:45,370 --> 00:24:45,760
probe

750
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,980

792
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,020

793
00:26:20,050 --> 00:26:22,630
i know whatever leaves soda fountain i

794
00:26:22,635 --> 00:26:24,640
tell you it's true to when i

795
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,890
was in grade school i think we

796
00:26:26,890 --> 00:26:28,810
had an assignment or something of like

797
00:26:28,810 --> 00:26:30,610
you have to write an essay assassin's

798
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:31,210
of

799
00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:33,280
sanders years

800
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,110
choose to accept

801
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:37,480
they had to say that every single

802
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:39,400
time they gave out homework like i

803
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,860
don't choose you know no thanks um

804
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:43,720
so i think the i think this

805
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:44,860
is not me running for office i

806
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:46,391
think the assignment was okay if you

807
00:26:46,391 --> 00:26:48,640
were running goes from family circus

808
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:52,630
ah

809
00:26:53,743 --> 00:26:55,630
i think the assignment was right write

810
00:26:55,630 --> 00:26:57,880
a paragraph about what you would promise

811
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,860

812
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:01,660
like that i don't know what but

813
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:04,840

817
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:11,260

00:27:11,290 --> 00:27:13,690

this one already did not like me

1006
00:34:02,485 --> 00:34:04,915
right because enforced i had a reputation

1007
00:34:04,915 --> 00:34:08,219
because brother she hated the family so

1008
00:34:08,219 --> 00:34:10,615
that's so dear yes so brother was

1009
00:34:10,615 --> 00:34:12,505
causing a ruckus my older brother and

1010
00:34:12,505 --> 00:34:13,855
i don't even know what he did

1011
00:34:13,855 --> 00:34:15,475
that she'd been here but here's where

1012
00:34:15,775 --> 00:34:16,855
this is why he may not have

1013
00:34:16,855 --> 00:34:18,505
done anything yeah um

1014
00:34:19,225 --> 00:34:22,225
but i was ah in fourth grade

1015
00:34:22,255 --> 00:34:24,985
we were having some sort of gym

1016
00:34:24,985 --> 00:34:27,355

to like move the desks and stuff

1018
00:34:28,795 --> 00:34:30,265
because it was raining outside maybe there's

1019
00:34:30,265 --> 00:34:32,245
maybe we had a sub we substitute

1020
00:34:32,245 --> 00:34:34,345
teacher oh that's what sub means

1021
00:34:35,485 --> 00:34:37,135

oh you're making this day hell for

1037
00:35:14,785 --> 00:35:16,645
this so i i remember that i

1038
00:35:16,645 --> 00:35:19,465
took my tie off and after we

1039
00:35:19,465 --> 00:35:21,325
moved the desks and i i like

1040
00:35:21,325 --> 00:35:23,905
tossed it on my desk and at

1041
00:35:23,905 --> 00:35:25,075
some point we were all getting out

1042
00:35:25,075 --> 00:35:28,105
of hand and the principal came in

1043
00:35:28,165 --> 00:35:29,305
and said like what's going on here

1044
00:35:29,335 --> 00:35:31,735
and this sub sub get ah get

1045
00:35:31,795 --> 00:35:33,049
word to the principle of like you've

1046
00:35:33,049 --> 00:35:34,495
gotta get in here i don't i

1047
00:35:34,495 --> 00:35:36,535
don't honestly i don't remember if if

1048
00:35:36,535 --> 00:35:38,725
that's what happened right or if we

1049
00:35:38,725 --> 00:35:40,705
were all just so fucking nuts

1050
00:35:42,145 --> 00:35:44,185
which i think is probably whatever and

1051
00:35:44,185 --> 00:35:46,645
so the the principal came in and

1052
00:35:46,675 --> 00:35:48,295
and so the sub is like they're

1053
00:35:48,325 --> 00:35:50,605
doing this doing that he was throwing

1054
00:35:50,605 --> 00:35:52,525
things pointing at me right because i

1055
00:35:52,525 --> 00:35:54,445
tell my boss oh yeah oh that's

1056
00:35:54,445 --> 00:35:57,175
so stupid and so she made me

1057
00:35:57,175 --> 00:35:59,425
the principal made me stand in her

1058
00:35:59,455 --> 00:36:00,925
office like the outer room of her

1059
00:36:00,925 --> 00:36:01,525
office

1060
00:36:01,525 --> 00:36:03,145
as for the rest of the day

1061
00:36:03,175 --> 00:36:05,845
stan i just stand there stand in

1062
00:36:05,845 --> 00:36:08,935
the yard or office now of the

1063
00:36:08,965 --> 00:36:12,022
day yeah keep doing it so it

1064
00:36:12,022 --> 00:36:13,495

1066
00:36:14,695 --> 00:36:16,255
of the punishment like i just stand

00:36:16,255 --> 00:36:18,145
there and stand a little more easier

1068
00:36:18,295 --> 00:36:19,675
but that would be a worse punishment

1069
00:36:19,675 --> 00:36:20,905
right i remember having to stand outside

1070
00:36:20,905 --> 00:36:21,625
the classroom

1071
00:36:22,195 --> 00:36:23,335
right like getting in trouble at having

1072
00:36:23,335 --> 00:36:25,135
seen outside the classroom nowadays zu hei

1073
00:36:25,135 --> 00:36:27,505
luft after two minutes it would be

1074
00:36:27,505 --> 00:36:28,825
like you don't gotta give me a

1075
00:36:28,825 --> 00:36:30,325
chair it is funny like the only

1076
00:36:30,325 --> 00:36:32,665
thing that you worry about then is

1077
00:36:32,725 --> 00:36:34,135
oh my if my parents find out

1078
00:36:34,135 --> 00:36:35,725
about this i'll be in trouble right

1079
00:36:35,725 --> 00:36:37,225
yeah um but if this is just

1080
00:36:37,225 --> 00:36:38,845
a punishment that stays in here where

1081
00:36:38,845 --> 00:36:40,315
i stand on between you and me

1082
00:36:40,345 --> 00:36:41,845

1083
00:36:42,205 --> 00:36:43,255

1085
00:36:45,115 --> 00:36:47,995
and i know i don't my parents

1086
00:36:47,995 --> 00:36:50,155
found out about that and it's like

1087
00:36:50,155 --> 00:36:52,105
one of those things right you you're

1088
00:36:52,105 --> 00:36:54,115
a kid and you're you're telling your

1089
00:36:54,265 --> 00:36:56,305
parent i didn't do anything wrong and

1090
00:36:56,305 --> 00:36:57,535
i think the assumption is that you're

1091
00:36:57,535 --> 00:37:00,055
like yeah yeah your your kids right

1092
00:37:00,055 --> 00:37:01,255
is they're trying to weasel out one

1093

hundred percent of they're lying no matter

1094
00:37:02,935 --> 00:37:03,925
what they said yeah yeah

1095
00:37:03,925 --> 00:37:06,235
yeah yeah i think everyone knows that

1096
00:37:06,355 --> 00:37:09,565
yeah um when i was little here

1097
00:37:09,565 --> 00:37:11,245

1099
00:37:12,387 --> 00:37:13,825
an essay i might have told it

00:37:13,825 --> 00:37:16,135
before alright well which will stop you

1101
00:37:16,135 --> 00:37:18,685

00:39:21,685 --> 00:39:23,545
the wall who knows it might have

1166
00:39:23,545 --> 00:39:24,985
even been accurate no matter how

1167
00:39:25,045 --> 00:39:26,245
far i went because whatever she thought

1168
00:39:26,275 --> 00:39:28,075
she saw she thought it was insane

1169
00:39:28,345 --> 00:39:29,125
and she made me feel like i

1170
00:39:29,125 --> 00:39:31,345
was absolutely so wrong and crazy and

1171
00:39:31,345 --> 00:39:34,285
bad gaslighting you yeah and i cried

1172
00:39:34,645 --> 00:39:36,445
and i went home and i told

1173
00:39:36,445 --> 00:39:39,055
my mom what happened i cried and

1174
00:39:39,055 --> 00:39:40,105
that she made me cry and all

1175
00:39:40,105 --> 00:39:42,265
this stuff because i'm i'm already knew

1176
00:39:42,505 --> 00:39:43,705
that she made my brother cry and

1177
00:39:43,705 --> 00:39:45,205
i'm sure countless their children should

1178
00:39:45,505 --> 00:39:47,455
i mean he she went and talked

1179
00:39:47,455 --> 00:39:49,015
to the principal about it and then

1180
00:39:49,015 --> 00:39:51,445
the principal told the teacher how you

1181
00:39:51,445 --> 00:39:52,825
can't you know this that's not thinking

1182
00:39:52,855 --> 00:39:54,745
and then i was in reading class

1183
00:39:54,775 --> 00:39:56,425
upstairs and i got up someone told

1184
00:39:56,425 --> 00:39:57,355
me i had to go down to

1185
00:39:57,505 --> 00:40:00,415
her room and downstairs in the basement

1186
00:40:00,445 --> 00:40:02,335
and talk to her in the middle

1187
00:40:02,365 --> 00:40:04,165
until i knew something bad was happening

1188
00:40:04,555 --> 00:40:05,318
and i remember dragging

1189
00:40:05,365 --> 00:40:06,805
my feet and i saw the janitor

1190
00:40:06,805 --> 00:40:07,705
in the hall who is a really

1191
00:40:07,705 --> 00:40:08,905
nice guy and i knew the one

1192
00:40:08,905 --> 00:40:09,805
that taught you to play chess

1193
00:40:11,635 --> 00:40:12,595
no but i didn't know him like

1194
00:40:12,595 --> 00:40:13,764
my whole life and to tell you

1195
00:40:13,795 --> 00:40:15,055
if i ever would any time i'd

1196
00:40:15,055 --> 00:40:16,645
be near the school he remembered me

1197
00:40:16,735 --> 00:40:18,895
a huge really nice guy he passed

1198
00:40:18,895 --> 00:40:20,215
away like two years ago as well

1199
00:40:20,275 --> 00:40:23,785
so um but he ah i saw

1200
00:40:23,785 --> 00:40:24,865
him and he kind of was he

1201
00:40:24,865 --> 00:40:25,795
was like sweeping some in the hall

1202
00:40:25,795 --> 00:40:26,575
and kind of gave me a look

1203
00:40:26,575 --> 00:40:27,625
and i was like really i remember

1204
00:40:27,625 --> 00:40:29,095
this i just remember it so clearly

1205
00:40:29,095 --> 00:40:30,565
because i was so nervous and he

1206
00:40:30,565 --> 00:40:31,045
gave me the look

1207
00:40:31,971 --> 00:40:33,880
like i like going to going into

1208
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:35,200
the teachers around like i was like

1209
00:40:35,410 --> 00:40:36,910
i was kind of like know when

1210
00:40:36,910 --> 00:40:37,720
like i remember like walking on the

1211
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:40,180
stairs really slow and then i got

1212
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:41,950
a room and it was it was

1213
00:40:41,950 --> 00:40:43,480
also like another world because like the

1214
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:45,130
other class was in there like oh

1215
00:40:45,130 --> 00:40:46,780
so this is what hap holmes oh

1216
00:40:46,788 --> 00:40:48,610
after hours yeah it was weird and

1217
00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:50,020
then she brought me whatever task it's

1218
00:40:50,110 --> 00:40:51,910
dark don't you ever tell your mother

1219
00:40:51,910 --> 00:40:53,620
either i made you cry what the

1220
00:40:53,650 --> 00:40:55,930
fuck you should told tell your mother

1221
00:40:55,930 --> 00:40:57,220
that while my mom knows i don't

1222
00:40:57,220 --> 00:40:58,600
know i told mom that then but

1223
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:00,550
oh definitely i definitely told her later

1224
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:03,610
that's insanity yes that's the behavior of

1225
00:41:03,610 --> 00:41:05,620
a lunatic it's so weird i mean

1226
00:41:05,650 --> 00:41:09,310
teachers can either be like the one

1227
00:41:09,310 --> 00:41:10,750
of the most positive forces in your

1228
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:12,040
life or they can be

1229
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:15,430
absolute fucking yeah but it's but my

1230
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:16,960
teacher who was my reading teacher who

1231
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,730
i was like in the other classes

1232
00:41:18,970 --> 00:41:20,770
was the sweetest woman ever she was

1233
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:21,970
so nice and she worked at barnes

1234
00:41:21,970 --> 00:41:22,870
noble in the summer and she was

1235
00:41:22,870 --> 00:41:25,120
such a nice lady and i always

1236
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:25,960
love to see her there and then

1237
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:26,920
she'd give me a hug she's probably

1238
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,600
still doing that this makes sense now

1239
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:30,820
why you don't know any numbers yeah

1240
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:32,170
i know i

1241
00:41:32,230 --> 00:41:36,190
just remembered that our ah school janitor

1242
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:37,570
when i was in grade school his

1243
00:41:37,570 --> 00:41:39,370
name was george and then we got

1244
00:41:39,370 --> 00:41:40,600
a new priest that was in charge

1245
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:42,730
of the priests really

1246
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:46,510
head by new pastor yeah and um

1247
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:48,790
he came with a dog german shepherd

1248
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:50,860
whose name was george so then we

1249
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:54,730
had to start calling the janitor a

1250
00:41:54,730 --> 00:41:57,276
different name what he said he called

1251
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:59,320
a dog a different name well the

1252
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:00,880
done with dogs is not going to

1253
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:02,506
learn another guy on board

1254
00:42:03,910 --> 00:42:04,240
or

1255
00:42:05,350 --> 00:42:07,180
here's my original pick up on it

1256
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:08,320
so he said we could call him

1257
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:10,990
bud oh that's nice yeah he took

1258
00:42:10,990 --> 00:42:12,760
to it alright but i'm sure wouldn't

1259
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:13,960
like having my name change because there's

1260
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:15,520
a dog named lauren which by the

1261
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:16,840
way oprah has a dog named lauren

1262
00:42:17,290 --> 00:42:20,526
rowe oprah comes around here i'll enjoy

1263
00:42:20,526 --> 00:42:22,510
whatever he says by the way we're

1264
00:42:22,510 --> 00:42:23,620
letting oprah on three of them if

1265
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:25,510
she wants so one of the few

1266
00:42:25,570 --> 00:42:27,310
it's not mary holland who have we

1267
00:42:27,310 --> 00:42:30,880
said oprah ah paid changed david yes

1268
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:32,980
yeah because that it might be other

1269
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:35,110
one there was a condition on mary

1270
00:42:35,110 --> 00:42:36,370
holland like if she were the last

1271
00:42:36,370 --> 00:42:38,650

if persona chan or tn she wouldn't

us a reason to just to listen

1280
00:42:52,870 --> 00:42:54,580

all that time yeah yeah that's so

1295
00:43:20,230 --> 00:43:21,190
there's a lot to learn when you're

1296
00:43:21,190 --> 00:43:23,230
brand new to earth i was talking

1297
00:43:23,230 --> 00:43:25,420

1298
00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:25,960
teacher

1299
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:26,800
you might go welcome to earth by

1300
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,210
somebody punching him in the face

1301
00:43:29,350 --> 00:43:30,160
as someone who used to be a

1302
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:31,480
teacher and i was i was bringing

1303
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:33,100
that up like that's a lot of

1304
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:35,830
pressure to be on for eight hours

1305
00:43:35,830 --> 00:43:36,670
of the day

1306
00:43:37,810 --> 00:43:39,430
and and do it do it different

1307
00:43:39,430 --> 00:43:41,470
thing five days a week yeah for

1308
00:43:41,470 --> 00:43:42,970
the entire year on stein he was

1309
00:43:42,970 --> 00:43:44,050
like i loved it i was like

1310
00:43:44,050 --> 00:43:45,687
a performer i was out there well

1311
00:43:45,718 --> 00:43:48,070
somebody chose like green like valuable mantic

1312
00:43:48,130 --> 00:43:49,750
know like some teachers are really good

1313
00:43:49,780 --> 00:43:51,040
like that that where they keep really

1314
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:52,900
interesting and they're like funnier and just

1315
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:54,430
and i guess once you figure it

1316
00:43:54,430 --> 00:43:55,990
out the first year you can refill

1317
00:43:55,990 --> 00:43:57,850

1318
00:43:57,940 --> 00:43:59,410

paid less i was gonna say what

1324
00:44:10,690 --> 00:44:12,430

like let me do it privately yeah

1348
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:01,660

00:45:02,770 --> 00:45:03,880
about that i mean are you cool

1351
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:05,200
with the kids hearing the great thing

1352
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:07,090
that i did that develop this moga

1353
00:45:07,630 --> 00:45:11,080
miracle so then the other thing was

1354
00:45:11,110 --> 00:45:12,250
i used to do i used to

1355
00:45:12,250 --> 00:45:14,320
do the trivia question in the announcements

1356
00:45:14,350 --> 00:45:16,090
every day of course huh

1357
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:18,280
and if you know this this is

1358
00:45:18,610 --> 00:45:20,410
is a lot of senses crazy that

1359
00:45:20,410 --> 00:45:21,820
we allow picking up dude did you

1360
00:45:21,820 --> 00:45:23,620
pick out what the question was yes

1361
00:45:24,010 --> 00:45:25,810
so what it was was when i

1362
00:45:25,810 --> 00:45:28,030
was a senior in high school um

1363
00:45:28,030 --> 00:45:29,020
by the way i was only there

1364
00:45:29,020 --> 00:45:30,640
for three classes in the morning that

1365
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:31,900
i went to the art school afterwards

1366
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:34,000
but somehow because i was interested in

1367
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,790
broadcasting they let me do the trick

1368
00:45:36,790 --> 00:45:38,260
a question and i forgot what the

1369
00:45:38,260 --> 00:45:41,770
prize was but every single class if

1370
00:45:41,770 --> 00:45:43,990
someone knew the answer there could only

1371
00:45:43,990 --> 00:45:46,840
be one per class they would run

1372
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:48,490
as fast as they could out of

1373
00:45:48,490 --> 00:45:50,830
their classroom to get to be the

1374
00:45:50,830 --> 00:45:53,350
first person to wear his fun where

1375
00:45:53,350 --> 00:45:54,970
we did the announcements and then that

1376
00:45:54,970 --> 00:45:56,320
should be what jeopardy is if they

1377
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:56,950
said what

1378
00:45:57,100 --> 00:45:58,720
and they were correct they got the

1379
00:45:58,750 --> 00:46:00,400
whole class got a prize or whatever

1380
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:02,044
every single day i love that and

1381
00:46:02,044 --> 00:46:03,790
they have example stuff and doing it

1382
00:46:03,790 --> 00:46:05,350
because people were like running and hurting

1383
00:46:05,350 --> 00:46:07,510
them scores and each other i'm pushing

1384
00:46:07,510 --> 00:46:09,790
