210
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:36,000
it was on this podcast i was

211
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,310
the person who they said okay you

212
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:40,050
are going to be in a wheelchair

213
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,960
and the nurse is going to adjust

214
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,120
your wheelchair and they have served me

215
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,530
well they have to do all of

216
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:48,750
these things and including they have to

217
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,490
lock the wheels on the wheelchair that's

218
00:07:50,559 --> 00:07:51,870
like the most important thing that we're

219
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:53,040
checking so they don't go round

220
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:55,830
and round so that so that you

221
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:58,440
suddenly don't like you know drift other

222
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,640
room roll out of the room or

223
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:02,340

249
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:51,090
i mean good luck i don't get

250
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:52,770
how it works if you were like

251
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:54,450
someone who couldn't get out of bed

252
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,490
how you basically turned on you you'd

253
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,350
turn on your side and you you

254
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:00,810
you do it yeah love nature ticket

255
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:03,480
school i don't believe this you should

256
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,330
i think it's a good deal i

257
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:08,160
tested these nurses they're out there doing

258
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,160
rogue bedpans if not all right so

259
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:12,750
so the thing that they that the

260
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:14,220
thing that they were checking for my

261
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,020
roommate was do they pull the curtain

262
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:18,450
to give him privacy because otherwise then

263
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:20,880
everyone can see what's going on in

264
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,790
their pan this guy's shit and so

265
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:24,720
for

266
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,820
or are the the two people that

267
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:29,430
did both of our tests the guy

268
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:30,660
who did mine did not lock the

269
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:32,400
wheels and the guy who did my

270
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,020
roommates did not pull the curtain and

271
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:35,850
so i got to watch my friend

272
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:37,920
pretend to take a shit into his

273
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,130
bedpan and he was mortified was your

274
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:44,580
weekend mortified because i'm sitting there literally

275
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:44,843
next

276
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,830
i'm watching this and lousy again the

277
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:48,810
entire time he wasn't naked what's this

278
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:51,210
hospital where there would be you'd be

279
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:53,070
right next to this guy's bed because

280
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:54,420
i was there i was in the

281
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:55,860
room next to him in the wheelchair

282
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,843
in the book but that's two in

283
00:09:57,843 --> 00:10:00,120
the curtain room next well that you

284
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:02,250
talk to our hospital system our healthcare

285
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:04,710
system putting all these people so close

286
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:05,040
together

287
00:10:05,625 --> 00:10:07,995
and in my opinion everyone should get

288
00:10:07,995 --> 00:10:10,035
their own room men shouldn't be nurses

289
00:10:10,035 --> 00:10:11,985
and this is the proof yes i

290
00:10:11,985 --> 00:10:15,435
fully agree a show mormons job

291
00:10:17,055 --> 00:10:19,275

where to begin okay so um my

304
00:10:46,665 --> 00:10:47,865
my boyfriend at the time was a

305
00:10:47,869 --> 00:10:50,559
part of this thing and it was

306
00:10:50,565 --> 00:10:54,075
the grammar yeah and he's saying those

307
00:10:54,075 --> 00:10:55,905
reality show i'm going to do some

308
00:10:55,935 --> 00:10:57,375
theatre and why don't you do your

309
00:10:57,375 --> 00:10:58,695
liver reality is like let's go to

310
00:10:58,695 --> 00:10:59,415
long beach

311
00:11:02,445 --> 00:11:04,755
the so i did it sometimes and

312
00:11:04,755 --> 00:11:06,255
the he would he would do it

313
00:11:06,255 --> 00:11:08,295
like every saturday did it sometimes and

314
00:11:08,295 --> 00:11:10,065
i will i started like you know

315
00:11:10,845 --> 00:11:13,755
participating um on your own or they

316
00:11:13,755 --> 00:11:15,735
were know with with him and like

317
00:11:15,765 --> 00:11:17,655
um and then there were other something

318
00:11:17,655 --> 00:11:19,575
other people for my improv community were

319
00:11:19,575 --> 00:11:20,775
a part of it and then other

320
00:11:20,775 --> 00:11:20,985
than that

321
00:11:20,985 --> 00:11:23,025
that it was like people that i

322
00:11:23,385 --> 00:11:24,555
i don't know how they got to

323
00:11:24,555 --> 00:11:26,505
be part i guess just actors so

324
00:11:27,795 --> 00:11:30,885
i um i would have different roles

325
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:33,405
throughout throughout the time so some dinner

326
00:11:33,405 --> 00:11:35,025
theater yes so you have to pretend

327
00:11:35,025 --> 00:11:36,795
that you're dinner oh i thought you

328
00:11:36,795 --> 00:11:38,445
have is you have as many roles

329
00:11:38,445 --> 00:11:39,795
as you want and yeah you can

330
00:11:39,825 --> 00:11:40,995
also have as many i usually get

331
00:11:40,995 --> 00:11:42,165
one role as bad dinner you got

332
00:11:42,165 --> 00:11:42,705
paid them

333
00:11:43,815 --> 00:11:45,195
so don't fill up on bread you

334
00:11:45,195 --> 00:11:45,795
gotta do

335
00:11:47,055 --> 00:11:49,725
so the role that i typically had

336
00:11:49,725 --> 00:11:51,555
was that i was there alone but

337
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:52,815
my sister was supposed to yeah i

338
00:11:52,815 --> 00:11:53,985
played dumb fish

339
00:11:56,055 --> 00:11:57,645
my sister was called it was it

340
00:11:57,645 --> 00:11:59,325
was my sister was supposed to show

341
00:11:59,325 --> 00:12:01,455
up but she was late and so

342
00:12:01,455 --> 00:12:03,345
i was kind of by myself and

343
00:12:03,345 --> 00:12:04,425
so there's this whole part in the

344
00:12:04,425 --> 00:12:05,985
beginning it's such a nightmare so you're

345
00:12:05,985 --> 00:12:07,815
like a a diner you're playing a

346
00:12:07,815 --> 00:12:10,007
diner yeah watching the everyone pretty much

347
00:12:10,035 --> 00:12:12,015
is except for two people who were

348
00:12:12,495 --> 00:12:14,625
all always men until like way later

349
00:12:14,625 --> 00:12:15,225
into the whole thing

350
00:12:15,225 --> 00:12:16,755
ng but they were the detectives and

351
00:12:16,755 --> 00:12:17,655
so they'd come out and have like

352
00:12:17,655 --> 00:12:20,025
the comedic sort of performance where they

353
00:12:20,625 --> 00:12:21,795
go through the script and kind of

354
00:12:21,795 --> 00:12:22,935
like so everyone was in like a

355
00:12:22,935 --> 00:12:24,377
dining room in this place yeah you're

356
00:12:24,377 --> 00:12:25,785
in like some people would roll at

357
00:12:25,785 --> 00:12:28,035
a hotel got oh i'm sorry sorry

358
00:12:28,035 --> 00:12:30,765
yeah so the idea is you're at

359
00:12:30,765 --> 00:12:32,145
this dinner and then all of a

360
00:12:32,145 --> 00:12:35,235
sudden there's somebody killed right on and

361
00:12:35,235 --> 00:12:35,385
then

362
00:12:36,931 --> 00:12:38,955
exactly yeah and then it's like we

363
00:12:38,955 --> 00:12:40,635
have to solve this and so everyone's

364
00:12:40,635 --> 00:12:41,955
trying all the people at the table

365
00:12:41,955 --> 00:12:42,945
are trying to figure out who the

366
00:12:43,065 --> 00:12:45,826
killer is oh my god completely all

367
00:12:45,826 --> 00:12:46,665
the people at the table trying to

368
00:12:46,665 --> 00:12:47,535
figure out who the killer is i

369
00:12:47,535 --> 00:12:48,855
feel like i've got like sixty bucks

370
00:12:48,855 --> 00:12:50,085
a show i don't know if that's

371
00:12:50,085 --> 00:12:53,325
even true um it sounds good but

372
00:12:53,325 --> 00:12:54,315
i don't know if that's true sounds

373
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:55,275
good to stop sure

374
00:12:55,845 --> 00:12:58,545
yes nobody was so many our wheelchairs

375
00:12:59,085 --> 00:13:01,035
with so many hours because you have

376
00:13:01,035 --> 00:13:02,442
to drive kind of far which jesus

377
00:13:02,442 --> 00:13:04,515
show and then you had to get

378
00:13:04,515 --> 00:13:06,075
there really early and then you know

379
00:13:06,075 --> 00:13:07,395
it's just a long that was a

380
00:13:07,395 --> 00:13:08,295
long thing so

381
00:13:09,585 --> 00:13:11,115
i was usually by my side but

382
00:13:11,325 --> 00:13:12,705
it was a nightmare for me honestly

383
00:13:12,705 --> 00:13:13,905
especially at this time in my life

384
00:13:13,905 --> 00:13:15,825
because i feel like i have gotten

385
00:13:15,885 --> 00:13:19,365
more comfortable being weird and public i

386
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:21,255
guess but at the time it was

387
00:13:21,255 --> 00:13:23,025
like it was like twenty three or

388
00:13:23,025 --> 00:13:24,465
something and i'm like whoa man i

389
00:13:24,465 --> 00:13:26,055
have to like walk around these people

390
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:28,365
and pretend that i'm here by myself

391
00:13:28,365 --> 00:13:29,625
but so there's like a cow

392
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:32,475
cocktail hour and my character would have

393
00:13:32,475 --> 00:13:33,675
to be a part of that and

394
00:13:33,675 --> 00:13:35,385
there's like these sort of questionnaire you're

395
00:13:35,385 --> 00:13:36,555
walking around kind of like filling out

396
00:13:36,555 --> 00:13:37,455
with people like it's kind of an

397
00:13:37,455 --> 00:13:40,275
activity and i know you're working there

398
00:13:40,275 --> 00:13:41,385
at the time or they do know

399
00:13:41,385 --> 00:13:43,215
they think i'm just so ideally they

400
00:13:43,215 --> 00:13:45,225
think i'm a dumb asshole okay so

401
00:13:45,225 --> 00:13:47,625
they think that i'm just and i'm

402
00:13:47,625 --> 00:13:49,785
like them and my sister is

403
00:13:49,785 --> 00:13:51,615
is not here and i saw some

404
00:13:51,615 --> 00:13:53,475
room for her and she's not here

405
00:13:54,045 --> 00:13:55,455
and so we go through this whole

406
00:13:55,455 --> 00:13:57,075
thing and you know some people will

407
00:13:57,075 --> 00:13:58,485
talk to me and then they start

408
00:13:58,485 --> 00:13:59,505
to say like i think you're an

409
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:00,705
editor you know whatever like there's like

410
00:14:00,705 --> 00:14:04,035
tires like that and then i would

411
00:14:04,035 --> 00:14:05,445
say that's one thing i hate about

412
00:14:05,445 --> 00:14:06,765
these things is everett no one wants

413
00:14:06,765 --> 00:14:08,055
to be tricked so they're always yeah

414
00:14:08,085 --> 00:14:09,645
i think your thing like just go

415
00:14:09,675 --> 00:14:09,915
just

416
00:14:10,005 --> 00:14:12,705
just have fun i know don't try

417
00:14:12,705 --> 00:14:14,025
to outsmart it that's like when you

418
00:14:14,025 --> 00:14:15,525
go to a magic show oh i

419
00:14:15,525 --> 00:14:17,149
know how you did that trick yeah

420
00:14:17,205 --> 00:14:18,645
it's so stupid so and this is

421
00:14:18,645 --> 00:14:19,935
as good as a magic show honestly

422
00:14:19,935 --> 00:14:21,225
because it was yeah such a good

423
00:14:21,225 --> 00:14:24,135
trick so yeah i would be at

424
00:14:24,135 --> 00:14:26,145
the table with like eight people or

425
00:14:26,145 --> 00:14:27,795
something and waiting when there's an empty

426
00:14:27,795 --> 00:14:29,205

we sit there they'll don't have to

430
00:14:34,635 --> 00:14:36,315
talk to these random people the whole

431
00:14:36,315 --> 00:14:37,245
time it's really like being in a

432
00:14:37,245 --> 00:14:39,195
weird wedding like you just like with

435
00:14:42,795 --> 00:14:47,055

if some talents to some real people

00:15:41,565 --> 00:15:42,615
is there a talent show in the

466
00:15:42,615 --> 00:15:42,825
middle

467
00:15:43,035 --> 00:15:45,105
yeah resuscitation doesn't normally happen

468
00:15:46,236 --> 00:15:47,925
i guess it's just to like break

469
00:15:47,925 --> 00:15:49,185
the ice or some shit i don't

470
00:15:49,185 --> 00:15:52,275
know wow always an important step in

471
00:15:52,275 --> 00:15:55,815
a murder investigation that's gonna hurt i

472
00:15:55,845 --> 00:15:57,225
will not try to argue that the

473
00:15:57,225 --> 00:15:58,875
scripts were good at all okay this

474
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:01,725
is like really i know we want

475
00:16:01,785 --> 00:16:03,945
i'm just curious like oh no i

476
00:16:03,975 --> 00:16:06,345
unattractive would say i don't really

477
00:16:06,392 --> 00:16:09,285
remember but they but they certainly they

478
00:16:09,287 --> 00:16:10,995
would be like interrogating people it'd be

479
00:16:10,995 --> 00:16:13,095
like sure we understand that so i'd

480
00:16:13,095 --> 00:16:14,805
be like who do they think and

481
00:16:14,805 --> 00:16:15,915
then i got hurt they were having

482
00:16:15,945 --> 00:16:17,655
trouble with this and going into the

483
00:16:17,655 --> 00:16:18,735
talent he hasn't

484
00:16:20,265 --> 00:16:21,195
where are you from who are you

485
00:16:21,195 --> 00:16:22,965
here with that kind of thing and

486
00:16:22,965 --> 00:16:24,135
it leads to some sort of like

487
00:16:24,165 --> 00:16:25,575
everyone saw someone stands up in visiting

488
00:16:25,575 --> 00:16:26,972
weird or like whatever it's like it's

489
00:16:26,985 --> 00:16:30,945
totally okay so it's silly you gotta

490
00:16:30,945 --> 00:16:32,445
like that at the top so

491
00:16:34,155 --> 00:16:35,235
i get up and now now i'm

492
00:16:35,235 --> 00:16:37,365
trying to remember though because i think

493
00:16:37,725 --> 00:16:40,425
i know better shut up i think

494
00:16:40,455 --> 00:16:42,165
i think i might of had two

495
00:16:42,165 --> 00:16:43,695
different parts but there was one point

496
00:16:43,695 --> 00:16:44,955
where i had to get slapped by

497
00:16:44,955 --> 00:16:47,235
another actress who was in the cast

498
00:16:47,685 --> 00:16:49,485
so i don't let this alright so

499
00:16:49,515 --> 00:16:51,825
i know i know so the scene

500
00:16:53,085 --> 00:16:54,465
was like i saw i think i

501
00:16:54,465 --> 00:16:55,125
think it must have been though i

502
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:56,715
was doing the scene this like acting

503
00:16:56,715 --> 00:16:57,915
scene and then they'd have another actor

504
00:16:57,915 --> 00:16:58,935
get up and then they'd be like

505
00:16:58,965 --> 00:17:00,585
okay we're we're gonna read these scripts

506
00:17:00,585 --> 00:17:02,955
whatever and she was slapped me and

507
00:17:02,955 --> 00:17:04,185
then during the rehearsal one day she

508
00:17:04,185 --> 00:17:06,135
slapped me so hard that it like

509
00:17:06,135 --> 00:17:07,785
really hurt and i was like during

510
00:17:07,785 --> 00:17:10,665
the rehearsal yeah yeah and it sucked

511
00:17:10,665 --> 00:17:12,255
and so that's just a side memory

512
00:17:12,555 --> 00:17:13,035
but so

513
00:17:13,095 --> 00:17:15,375
then we apologize or yeah but it

514
00:17:15,375 --> 00:17:17,025
was it was really it was really

515
00:17:17,025 --> 00:17:20,745
weird and then i don't i mean

516
00:17:20,805 --> 00:17:22,665
and then i get killed okay so

517
00:17:22,695 --> 00:17:24,675
basically there's a slap the lights go

518
00:17:24,675 --> 00:17:26,265
out i scream

519
00:17:27,855 --> 00:17:30,105
and then when the lights come back

520
00:17:30,135 --> 00:17:32,690
up you're dead yeah yeah i'm trying

521
00:17:34,005 --> 00:17:36,735
yeah i mean it doesn't happen that

522
00:17:36,735 --> 00:17:38,895
way i have some there's there's light

523
00:17:38,895 --> 00:17:41,265
so light goods come back up and

524
00:17:41,265 --> 00:17:43,815
it's like i'm absolutely and rose out

525
00:17:43,815 --> 00:17:45,195
of the i have a stab wound

526
00:17:45,225 --> 00:17:46,695
i'm remembering this i'm i haven't i

527
00:17:46,695 --> 00:17:47,685
haven't thought about this in like ten

528
00:17:47,685 --> 00:17:50,115
years did you have i established to

529
00:17:50,115 --> 00:17:52,095
yourself in the dark there's like something

530
00:17:52,095 --> 00:17:53,445
under the shirt or something that was

531
00:17:53,445 --> 00:17:53,685
already

532
00:17:53,865 --> 00:17:55,455
laid i care for my height or

533
00:17:55,485 --> 00:17:57,615
part of your shirt you reveal yeah

534
00:17:57,645 --> 00:18:00,795
something happened and then something happened and

535
00:18:00,795 --> 00:18:01,635
the lights go out again then i

536
00:18:01,635 --> 00:18:03,555
like i like taken out or whatever

537
00:18:03,555 --> 00:18:05,445
and it's like what then and then

538
00:18:05,445 --> 00:18:06,465
that was always kind of good because

539
00:18:06,465 --> 00:18:07,965
i'd be done really early but the

540
00:18:07,995 --> 00:18:09,405
other part of me no longer did

541
00:18:09,405 --> 00:18:10,485
you have to bow at the end

542
00:18:10,605 --> 00:18:12,585
i usually had to stay because oh

543
00:18:12,585 --> 00:18:13,995
my my wax was in

544
00:18:14,595 --> 00:18:18,645
so ah then the well the i

545
00:18:18,645 --> 00:18:20,085
what i'm remembering about how bad it

546
00:18:20,085 --> 00:18:21,705
was is that i really wasn't good

547
00:18:21,705 --> 00:18:24,465
at screaming yet like i feel like

548
00:18:25,575 --> 00:18:30,195
ah like i think i there was

549
00:18:30,195 --> 00:18:31,395
a period of my life where like

550
00:18:31,425 --> 00:18:33,975
i could not say i could not

551
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:36,195
i could not laugh i could not

552
00:18:36,225 --> 00:18:38,895
act scream or act laugh without it

553
00:18:38,895 --> 00:18:40,605
being like really challenging for me for

554
00:18:40,605 --> 00:18:42,255
some reason you did earlier in the

555

in london and the guy had a

679
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:52,230
heart attack show is not more important

680
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:54,780
than giving this guy proper medical of

681
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:56,820
course they got i mean the actors

682
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:58,290

nine one one like it was happening

684
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:01,080
but the people around thought it was

685
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,120
part of the thing sure and then

686
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:06,900
the um he he died and then

687
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:08,970

688
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:10,049
little bit like deal with us and

if they want but we're going to

693
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:15,840
the show must go on and he

694
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:16,590
was like it's just because they were

695
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:17,820
too cheap to give her one that

696
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:20,040
right yeah oh yeah that's also the

697
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:22,440
show must go on was a saying

698
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:24,450
that was started by tightwads who ran

down one when london it was pretty

702
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,640
much halfway at the halfway point of

703
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:38,160
my set and i heard this guy

704
00:23:40,530 --> 00:23:42,270
i heard somebody in the audience go

705
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:46,530
oh and i honestly thought like oh

706
00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:48,630
shit this guy's reviews are ready yeah

707
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:50,133
i really i honestly thought it was

708
00:23:50,133 --> 00:23:51,120
a reaction when i was doing

709
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,820
and then i heard some like some

710
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:58,020
like like urgent you know talking and

711
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:00,150
um more or somebody than your normal

712
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:03,210
heckling yes usually they were terrible you're

713
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:04,320

ah um and somebody said he's he's

715
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:11,280
i think he's had a heart attack

716
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,890
and so the we stopped the show

717
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:15,480
lights came up and i was like

718
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:19,140
ah this was a moment where i

719
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:21,060
later was haunted by it because i

720
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:23,220
realized this is who i am in

721
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:25,260
a crisis i did not know what

722
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:25,680
to do

723
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,900
and so you ran all the way

724
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,100
no but i was just like kind

725
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,750
of standing there like like trying to

726
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:32,250
like seeing what was happening what was

727
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:33,690
going on and then it was this

728
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:35,340
yeah who were like trying to assess

729
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:37,230
the situation because you you're in the

730
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:38,700
middle of a thing you can't quite

731
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:41,700
tell yeah i felt like it was

732
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:45,180
a weird thing where okay i'm on

733
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:45,840
stage literally

734
00:24:45,963 --> 00:24:47,850
there's lights on me with a microphone

735
00:24:47,910 --> 00:24:50,460
i feel like i should be doing

736
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:52,080
some of the situation yeah yeah but

737
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,060
i don't shell wanting to do i

738
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:55,800
don't know what to do and so

739
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:58,050

to to

805
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:16,170
enjoy themselves because this arts later than

806
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:18,030
i think and then i haven't he

807
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:20,250
lived which is different i think that

808
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:22,350
he did i asked i asked the

809
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:24,840
theater i said you can like you

810
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,070
know who that was right based on

811
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:28,290
the reservation figure out yes so can

812
00:27:28,290 --> 00:27:29,280
you we can make sure that i

813
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,080
didn't kill him with my comedy right

814
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,030
or confirmed that i did so powerful

815
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:38,250
oh but they never told they never

816
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:39,150
got back to me so i don't

817
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:40,860
know i'm assuming that the guy lift

818
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:42,660
my assumption is he did not

819
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:46,470
i'm in between i think he's immortal

820
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,240
i got to see him being carted

821
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,040
out and he was conscious got to

822
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:53,521
give you the old village farms okay

823
00:27:53,521 --> 00:27:55,170
he gave me a terminator thumbs up

824
00:27:55,170 --> 00:27:56,580
like very slowly

825
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:01,590
she closed the door on the yeah

826
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:03,390
they pulled it out sideways so his

827
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:04,350
thumb could be the last thing it

828
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:05,880
is the last thing the terminator does

829
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,740
right in number two yeah he gives

830
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:09,660
him the thumbs up from molten lava

831
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:10,530
from lava

832
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:12,990

853
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:09,240
side memory as well of ah someone

854
00:29:09,253 --> 00:29:11,580
slapping me in a in a dramatic

855
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:14,280
setting um in that movie that scott

856
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,930
and i talked about previously where i

857
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:18,840
could not drive and ah and you

858
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,400
found out recently they cut that snow

859
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:22,740
yeah when i was digitizing all my

860
00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:24,300
all my old tape we all laughed

861
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:26,130
it at your driving at the premiere

862
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,900
at the premiere that made the director

863
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:30,360
say mushy cut that out i think

864
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:32,130

865
00:29:32,130 --> 00:29:33,240
that i had not because i look

866
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,920

00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:40,410
shit sir

870
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:41,250
comedy history

871
00:29:42,810 --> 00:29:44,280
well we're keeping the memory alive and

872
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:46,410
that's what's true there was a guy

873
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,760
in the it was a mob movie

874
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:48,900
right so i'm in the ma i'm

875
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:49,890
going to count for the mob and

876
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:51,570
the guy who's playing the mob boss

877
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,630
at one point we were in the

878
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:56,820
scene where he was i know what

879
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:59,010
he was going for he was going

880
00:29:59,010 --> 00:30:01,830
for a very um mob movie kind

881
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:02,640
of thing where he

882
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,740
he's gonna like pat my cheek like

883
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:06,630
this you know what i mean yeah

884
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,730
like you but it's all bambino yeah

885
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:12,870
but instead he stiff arm ah just

886
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:15,840
slaps my face like leaves his hand

887
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,220
the hair and it's like this is

888
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:18,780
not in there that's not a thing

889
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:21,690
that anyone does it's feeling i do

890
00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:22,800
it more than one take

891
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,090
yes or no he did a one

892
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:26,160
take and i was so mad i

893
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:28,500
was so mad like because he didn't

894
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:29,850
he didn't prepare and he was just

895
00:30:29,850 --> 00:30:31,170
like it just came over me to

896
00:30:31,170 --> 00:30:32,730
do that and i was like oh

897
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:34,770
no yeah first of all that you

898
00:30:34,770 --> 00:30:36,930
can not come over you today cannot

899
00:30:36,930 --> 00:30:38,400
you can't do that you can't do

900
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,870
that there's more takes so if you

901
00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:42,000
have that idea do it later you're

902
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:42,960
not like this guy was

903
00:30:43,625 --> 00:30:44,795
and after that it was like i

904
00:30:44,795 --> 00:30:47,165
was in this character right but also

905
00:30:47,165 --> 00:30:49,235
that's not that's not a thing that

906
00:30:49,235 --> 00:30:51,905
anyone does so this instinct that you

907
00:30:51,905 --> 00:30:53,855
have is wrong for many reasons it

908
00:30:53,855 --> 00:30:56,555
also sucks because you are being a

909
00:30:56,555 --> 00:30:59,105
professional have lines to do after that

910
00:30:59,135 --> 00:31:00,545
yeah you need to make them make

911
00:31:00,545 --> 00:31:03,485
sense with whatever he's doing and and

912
00:31:03,485 --> 00:31:03,785
that mm

913
00:31:03,819 --> 00:31:05,585
may not the lines may not make

914
00:31:05,585 --> 00:31:07,594
sense because you're so fucking pissed if

915
00:31:07,594 --> 00:31:09,365
what's it's yeah it's going to mean

916
00:31:09,365 --> 00:31:11,705
jar completely already but thanks to this

917
00:31:11,795 --> 00:31:13,475
yeah a completely jarring thing that was

918
00:31:13,475 --> 00:31:15,515
not in the script it's like you

919
00:31:15,515 --> 00:31:17,495
can't just go rogue and decide you're

920
00:31:17,495 --> 00:31:19,265
going to do that you know that's

921
00:31:19,265 --> 00:31:22,085
so rude it was it was sort

922
00:31:22,085 --> 00:31:23,465
of trauma for me

923

1038
00:35:50,795 --> 00:35:52,475

do admit that we had done any

1040
00:35:53,945 --> 00:35:55,655
of the wrong things now admittedly it

1041
00:35:55,655 --> 00:35:57,275

1044
00:36:03,065 --> 00:36:04,535
iman to be like okay well we're

1045
00:36:04,535 --> 00:36:05,825
going to have to punish both of

1046
00:36:05,825 --> 00:36:09,275
you until one of you she ah

1047
00:36:09,305 --> 00:36:11,495
fast job so one of you breaks

1048
00:36:11,675 --> 00:36:15,095
and my brother i gotta say he

1049
00:36:15,095 --> 00:36:18,095
was pretty good about never giving it

1050
00:36:18,095 --> 00:36:19,355
up that it was him and letting

1051
00:36:19,355 --> 00:36:21,485

00:36:22,505 --> 00:36:26,345
wow he yeah ady never broke he

1053
00:36:26,345 --> 00:36:28,505

1054
00:36:28,505 --> 00:36:30,305
remember breaking at one point going like

1055
00:36:30,305 --> 00:36:31,985
i did it before it was so

1056
00:36:31,985 --> 00:36:33,785
that he wouldn't get punished but i'm

1057
00:36:33,785 --> 00:36:35,375
pretty sure oh

1058
00:36:36,605 --> 00:36:38,645
he never did but ah yeah i

1059
00:36:38,645 --> 00:36:40,025
was also thinking the other day i

1060
00:36:40,025 --> 00:36:41,525
was thinking about the one time that

1061
00:36:41,825 --> 00:36:44,765
we must have been five and seven

1062
00:36:44,765 --> 00:36:47,735
and we were at the library and

1063
00:36:47,735 --> 00:36:49,805
my mom didn't pick us up

1064
00:36:50,855 --> 00:36:52,655
and i don't know i don't know

1065
00:36:52,655 --> 00:36:54,845
how long we we must have waited

1066
00:36:55,205 --> 00:36:56,315
but to us it seemed like an

1067
00:36:56,315 --> 00:36:57,725
eternity but i bet it was ten

1068
00:36:57,725 --> 00:36:59,525
minutes yeah for we were like well

1069
00:36:59,615 --> 00:37:01,205
we better walk to my aunt's house

1070
00:37:01,235 --> 00:37:02,555
who i know she lives around here

1071
00:37:02,555 --> 00:37:03,155
somewhere

1072
00:37:04,745 --> 00:37:06,305
so we've led you to start walking

1073
00:37:06,875 --> 00:37:08,435
so we we walked and we got

1074
00:37:08,435 --> 00:37:11,405
lost and then eventually my mom pulled

1075
00:37:11,405 --> 00:37:13,505
up that she'd been driving around the

1076
00:37:13,505 --> 00:37:16,205
neighborhood just looking for us and eventually

1077
00:37:16,205 --> 00:37:17,615
she pulled out does your shirt say

1078
00:37:17,615 --> 00:37:18,665

1082
00:37:30,635 --> 00:37:33,725

1083
00:37:33,875 --> 00:37:37,385
mayor of east town for the accents

1084
00:37:37,385 --> 00:37:39,425
yes i did yes and how are

1085
00:37:39,425 --> 00:37:39,965
the accents

1086
00:37:40,025 --> 00:37:42,305
bad right ah it's not a sham

1087
00:37:42,515 --> 00:37:45,545
yeah it's it's an hbo miniseries kate

1088
00:37:45,545 --> 00:37:49,055
winslet is playing a um ah a

1089
00:37:49,085 --> 00:37:52,595
detective in a small town near philadelphia

1090
00:37:53,075 --> 00:37:56,165
um and she is going for the

1091
00:37:56,165 --> 00:37:58,175
accent she's gone for it i'm gonna

1092
00:37:58,175 --> 00:38:00,185
watch only i'm only on certain words

1093
00:38:00,215 --> 00:38:03,065
like yeah yea yeah like water water

1094
00:38:03,425 --> 00:38:06,005
water water there are certain like she's

1095
00:38:06,035 --> 00:38:08,315
she's doing the o words because those

1096
00:38:08,315 --> 00:38:10,355
are good signifiers but the thing is

1097
00:38:11,075 --> 00:38:14,735
there's other words that she's pronouncing just

1098
00:38:14,735 --> 00:38:16,595
like the way she's doing her flat

1099
00:38:16,595 --> 00:38:17,975
american accent you know what i mean

1100
00:38:17,975 --> 00:38:20,195
yeah and so it's worse than if

1101
00:38:20,195 --> 00:38:20,345
she

1102
00:38:20,345 --> 00:38:22,115
she wasn't doing it at all

1103
00:38:22,895 --> 00:38:24,545
yeah because no one else is really

1104
00:38:24,545 --> 00:38:26,375
doing it that much either so it's

1105
00:38:26,375 --> 00:38:28,085

1108
00:38:31,565 --> 00:38:33,965

1114
00:38:46,415 --> 00:38:48,155
i once um did a short film

1115
00:38:48,155 --> 00:38:50,135
in utah and the girl who says

1116
00:38:50,135 --> 00:38:52,805
after baby sitting yeah the girl who

1117
00:38:52,805 --> 00:38:55,385
picked me up at the transitional period

1118
00:38:55,985 --> 00:38:57,785
this was this is when i was

1119
00:38:57,785 --> 00:38:59,735
moving for babysitting into film and tv

1120
00:38:59,735 --> 00:39:01,535
just doing short ones to a tv

1121
00:39:01,535 --> 00:39:02,915
and then i did some shorts

1122
00:39:03,425 --> 00:39:06,125
um but this girl who picks me

1123
00:39:06,125 --> 00:39:06,815
up at the airport it was like

1124
00:39:06,815 --> 00:39:08,045
just like a low budget thing that

1125
00:39:08,045 --> 00:39:09,245
my friend was making so he just

1126
00:39:09,245 --> 00:39:11,015
like had random people that he knew

1127
00:39:11,045 --> 00:39:12,963
helping out so some girl just picked

1128
00:39:12,963 --> 00:39:15,275
me up from the random her accent

1129
00:39:15,665 --> 00:39:17,945
she's from salt lake city or like

1130
00:39:18,125 --> 00:39:20,135
around there but it must be like

1131
00:39:20,135 --> 00:39:22,535
a small town it was so i

1132
00:39:22,535 --> 00:39:23,225
could have understood

1133
00:39:23,225 --> 00:39:24,785
and a word she was saying it

1134
00:39:24,785 --> 00:39:26,465
was like really it was like she

1135
00:39:26,465 --> 00:39:27,965
was amish or something it was like

1136
00:39:27,965 --> 00:39:30,545
a very odd accent like nothing i'd

1137
00:39:30,545 --> 00:39:32,495
ever heard before and i had to

1138
00:39:32,495 --> 00:39:35,284
like work so hard to have the

1139
00:39:35,284 --> 00:39:37,175
conversation and not say like what like

1140
00:39:37,175 --> 00:39:39,245
every time she said anything but i

1141
00:39:39,245 --> 00:39:41,345
can't even begin to like do limitation

1142
00:39:41,345 --> 00:39:43,385
of it it was just like very

1143
00:39:43,655 --> 00:39:46,025

1144
00:39:46,025 --> 00:39:48,305
family but like but like every word

1145
00:39:48,305 --> 00:39:50,195

1146
00:39:50,225 --> 00:39:51,665
you will eat yeah there you go

1147
00:39:51,665 --> 00:39:52,805

1149
00:39:59,735 --> 00:40:01,655

that area don't want to believe this

1158
00:40:20,585 --> 00:40:21,695
shit because they're a republican

1159
00:40:22,985 --> 00:40:25,865
um probably yeah it doesn't help when

1160
00:40:25,865 --> 00:40:28,265
the major news source is saying it's

1161
00:40:28,265 --> 00:40:29,075
a scam

1162
00:40:30,275 --> 00:40:32,765

yeah um josh flagg who i mentioned

1178
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:11,550
on a previous episode

1179
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:14,160
was filming people he was he lives

1180
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:16,080

1181
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:17,910
of the realtors on million dollar listing

1182
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:20,730

00:41:20,730 --> 00:41:23,820
bajillion dollar properties he is gay and

1184
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:25,140
he which is an important part of

1185
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:27,240
the story because he would go to

1186
00:41:28,410 --> 00:41:31,200
i never mentioned yeah i would go

1187
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,120
to trump rallies that were like in

1188
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:35,880
his neighborhood like in beverley hills and

1189
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:38,751
interview people on instagram and just ask

1190
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:40,740
them questions and so like i had

1191
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:43,410
to assume that he thought he did

1192
00:41:43,410 --> 00:41:45,930
not agree with them basically right based

1193
00:41:45,930 --> 00:41:47,610
on what i know about him but

1194
00:41:47,610 --> 00:41:48,540
he also is really rich

1195
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:49,320
so it's one of those things were

1196
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:50,520
like i don't know maybe he's yeah

1197
00:41:51,090 --> 00:41:52,710
and he was entering this one woman

1198
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:54,510
who was so bananas and she had

1199
00:41:54,510 --> 00:41:56,400
so much plastic surgery and she was

1200
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:57,480
like just saying you know all the

1201
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:59,820
horrible stuff supporting trump and whatever and

1202
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:01,740
then turns out she ended up being

1203
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:03,120
at january six

1204
00:42:04,290 --> 00:42:08,910

1205
00:42:08,910 --> 00:42:10,710

1206
00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:12,510
did resident it was pretty crazy it

1207
00:42:12,510 --> 00:42:14,760
was like a full circle thing god

1208
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:17,460
damn all those people yeah there's so

1209
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:17,790
much

1210
00:42:19,110 --> 00:42:21,570
justly the sheer amount of video of

1211
00:42:21,570 --> 00:42:24,960
all those people like easily posting themselves

1212
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:28,110
so ridiculous it's one of the only

1213
00:42:28,290 --> 00:42:30,750
like just breaking the law for the

1214
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:33,210
clout for internet clout yeah it's so

1215
00:42:33,210 --> 00:42:33,660
funny

1216
00:42:35,130 --> 00:42:36,750
it also speaks to like people that

1217
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:38,730
have lived their life thinking there will

1218
00:42:38,730 --> 00:42:40,800
never be any consequences for them like

1219
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,750
that they can do whatever they want

1220
00:42:43,050 --> 00:42:46,500
including break into the fucking capital and

1221
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:48,840
film themselves trying to think of any

1222
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:50,490
consequences that have ever happened to me

my license in twenty ten yeah um

1508
00:52:49,777 --> 00:52:51,610

a car when someone period

1510
00:52:56,080 --> 00:52:58,150

oh you can just review so when

1545
00:54:09,340 --> 00:54:11,050
i was learning to drive can my

1546
00:54:11,050 --> 00:54:12,070
friend would pick me up after the

1547
00:54:12,070 --> 00:54:14,807
action list actually stories i'm sure i'm

1548
00:54:14,817 --> 00:54:17,500
sure jumper um sw

1549
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:19,240
so ah when i was when i

1550
00:54:19,270 --> 00:54:22,060
saw my permit and i took driving

1551
00:54:22,060 --> 00:54:23,860
lessons i did not let i have

1552
00:54:23,860 --> 00:54:25,630
many people offered to teach me how

1553
00:54:25,630 --> 00:54:26,827
to drive and i was like no

1554
00:54:27,250 --> 00:54:28,060
let me do it for fun let's

1555
00:54:28,060 --> 00:54:30,910
stay friends so um yeah oh gotta

1556
00:54:30,910 --> 00:54:32,350
be way too much pressure it will

1557
00:54:32,350 --> 00:54:34,510
be so it would be ridiculous i

1558
00:54:34,510 --> 00:54:35,500
don't know if there was a movie

1559
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:37,660
about your life there the song

1560
00:54:37,690 --> 00:54:39,790
under pressure would be playing while there

1561
00:54:39,790 --> 00:54:42,250
was a montage early driving exactly but

1562
00:54:42,430 --> 00:54:43,390
it would also be in the trailer

1563
00:54:43,390 --> 00:54:44,650
but not in the movie would be

1564
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:46,600
dangerous not have that extra brake on

1565
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:47,950
the driver's side you know on the

1566
00:54:47,950 --> 00:54:49,810
passenger side yes yes yes my man

1567
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:51,010
edgar he told me on a job

1568
00:54:51,010 --> 00:54:52,780
he did a great job wow should

1569
00:54:52,780 --> 00:54:54,910
all cars have that extra break yeah

1570
00:54:55,270 --> 00:54:57,280
that would cost so many accidents all

1571
00:54:57,280 --> 00:54:57,640
cars

1572
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,490
are you just some brakes to steering

1573
00:55:00,490 --> 00:55:02,110
wheels to horns

1574
00:55:03,580 --> 00:55:05,110
one of the following items later used

1575
00:55:05,110 --> 00:55:06,130
this year well if you just like

1576
00:55:06,130 --> 00:55:07,785

1694
00:59:29,770 --> 00:59:30,280

he loves us i know we've made

1696
00:59:33,580 --> 00:59:34,750
jokes about it but josh showed up

1697
00:59:34,750 --> 00:59:35,620
at my house one night

1698
00:59:37,090 --> 00:59:39,670
alright this is called selling i'm kidding

1699
00:59:39,700 --> 00:59:40,960
but i'm actually really scared

1700
00:59:43,810 --> 00:59:46,360
this is a game called alphabet skip

1701
00:59:47,260 --> 00:59:51,310
and here's who plays alphabets were you

1702
00:59:51,610 --> 00:59:53,590
and here's how it goes pick a

1703
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:56,110
letter of the alphabet at random begin

1704
00:59:56,110 --> 00:59:58,660
a three person scene using say an

1705
00:59:58,660 --> 01:00:01,750
occupation as a suggestion where no one

1706
01:00:01,750 --> 01:00:02,140
is allowed

1707
01:00:02,140 --> 01:00:04,060
vowed to use any words that begin

1708
01:00:04,060 --> 01:00:06,820
with that letter if someone messes up

1709
01:00:06,820 --> 01:00:08,230
they have to retake their last line

1710
01:00:08,230 --> 01:00:10,480
without using the offending word for an

1711
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:13,600
extra challenge every sixty seconds pick another

1712
01:00:13,630 --> 01:00:15,220
letter at random and no one is

1713
01:00:15,220 --> 01:00:16,660
allowed to use any words that begin

1714
01:00:16,660 --> 01:00:18,370
with any of the letters selected what

1715
01:00:18,370 --> 01:00:20,230
i would suggest it's josh's here is

1716
01:00:20,230 --> 01:00:21,790
he picks the letter he picks the

1717
01:00:21,790 --> 01:00:22,300
occupation

1718
01:00:22,300 --> 01:00:23,980
and and after every sixty seconds he

1719
01:00:23,980 --> 01:00:26,620
shouts out a new letter and he

1720
01:00:26,620 --> 01:00:28,000
catches us if we

1721
01:00:30,190 --> 01:00:33,640

1722
01:00:33,640 --> 01:00:35,800

1723
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:38,170
