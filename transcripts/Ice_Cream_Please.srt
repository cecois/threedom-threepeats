they were a brand i don't know

269
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,601
if they're still existed but they were

270
00:09:48,601 --> 00:09:49,980
a brand of underwear they were they

271
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,240

272
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,620

they were what people were talking about

278
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:06,720
them because i think before

279
00:10:07,405 --> 00:10:10,285
before then like underwear was just kind

280
00:10:10,285 --> 00:10:11,725
of boring or whatever and then suddenly

281
00:10:11,725 --> 00:10:13,075
like dvds came out they were like

282
00:10:13,075 --> 00:10:15,415
sexy underwear i thought b v d's

283
00:10:15,415 --> 00:10:18,145
was like an old-fashioned there'll be aware

284
00:10:18,505 --> 00:10:21,175
mid arise they look like super fifties

285
00:10:21,205 --> 00:10:22,945
and yeah i don't think it's actually

286
00:10:22,975 --> 00:10:25,105
hot i think it's they're not like

287
00:10:25,165 --> 00:10:27,475
sexy nineties calvin klein underwear

288
00:10:27,595 --> 00:10:29,215
that you're thinking of calvin klein underwear

289
00:10:30,025 --> 00:10:30,625
oh right

290
00:10:31,885 --> 00:10:34,465
you're thinking of jockey shorts wait so

291
00:10:34,645 --> 00:10:37,675
new i just found what certain positions

292
00:10:39,565 --> 00:10:43,705
before nafta was circumcision care protective cover

293
00:10:43,945 --> 00:10:45,625
so it's underwear that has a plastic

294
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:47,905
dick hole and you put your dick

295
00:10:47,905 --> 00:10:48,055
in

296
00:10:49,735 --> 00:10:51,295
okay but bb these are a nineteen

297
00:10:51,295 --> 00:10:53,875
eighties vintage three pair white underwear so

298
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:56,155
there's a package that has bpd so

299
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:58,225
why would someone buy him these i

300
00:10:58,225 --> 00:11:01,495
guess because he stained them you when

301
00:11:01,495 --> 00:11:03,925
he was having sex with lacroix is

302
00:11:03,925 --> 00:11:06,265
the idea that that the the lover

303
00:11:06,265 --> 00:11:09,115
is provided him with soaring underwear and

304
00:11:09,565 --> 00:11:11,695
let the wife like or the girlfriend

305
00:11:11,695 --> 00:11:13,855
whatever she is she's suspicious because he

306
00:11:13,855 --> 00:11:16,015
has new underwear and maybe maybe it's

307
00:11:16,105 --> 00:11:19,345
in the nineties wives by their underwear

308
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:21,205

hit with a brick the song was

315
00:11:33,775 --> 00:11:36,475
inspired by arsenio hall was it was

316
00:11:36,475 --> 00:11:39,025
ah one of his ah in his

317
00:11:39,025 --> 00:11:41,365
monologue it's samuel horse show he would

318
00:11:41,395 --> 00:11:43,075
he would always have a little not

319
00:11:43,075 --> 00:11:44,575
always but quite often have a little

320
00:11:44,575 --> 00:11:47,065
section where he would talk about things

321
00:11:47,065 --> 00:11:48,445
that make you go which was sort

322
00:11:48,445 --> 00:11:49,585
of like i guess kind of

323
00:11:49,615 --> 00:11:52,315
like stiglitz in a way as well

00:11:52,315 --> 00:11:54,235
or no jack candies like deep thoughts

325
00:11:54,235 --> 00:11:55,795
or whatever but sort of but though

326
00:11:55,802 --> 00:11:57,565
it was tied to current events yeah

327
00:11:57,775 --> 00:11:58,735
well i don't even know if it

328
00:11:58,735 --> 00:11:59,935

him you and ye

334
00:12:09,775 --> 00:12:11,213

little space so when he would lay

337
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:17,215
his finger aside of his head as

338
00:12:17,215 --> 00:12:19,585
if in deep thought by jack handey

339
00:12:19,945 --> 00:12:21,415

340
00:12:21,415 --> 00:12:22,975

558
00:20:09,025 --> 00:20:10,135
didn't get asked by a boy to

559
00:20:10,135 --> 00:20:12,655

752
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,440
to camp and having to ask girls

753
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:07,670
to dance and that was a big

754
00:27:07,670 --> 00:27:09,140
part of like ok when you ask

755
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:10,250
a girl to dance do this and

756
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:11,330
this and of course

757
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:13,610
source the the the day where we

758
00:27:13,610 --> 00:27:14,870
what were the things that you had

759
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:16,310
to deal it was just like the

760
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:19,460
dances going to come up it's traditional

761
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:20,900
for the man to ask the woman

762
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:22,610
to for the dan's yeah don't be

763
00:27:22,610 --> 00:27:24,470
scared guys you know i know you're

764
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:25,790
going to be nervous but it all

765
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:27,470
it's very easy you just go right

766
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:29,030
go right up to the girl and

767
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:30,410
you ask her to dance and if

768
00:27:30,410 --> 00:27:31,490
she's polite she'll say

769
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:33,410
say yes you know do they feel

770
00:27:33,438 --> 00:27:35,600
like go ahead do they give you

00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,550
like a little script to to use

772
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:38,420

774
00:27:39,890 --> 00:27:42,500

780
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:57,620

787
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:11,600

i always forget that that's a huge

793
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:20,240
part of your childhood is that there

794
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,770

839
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:47,480
say you're getting a really fair amount

840
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:49,340
of money every time that you know

841
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:50,510
and you could use it back in

842
00:29:50,510 --> 00:29:53,000
the day probably ten years ago i

843
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,950
would've said no and now that no

844
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:56,300
one will ever want me on it

845
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:58,040
i'm sort of like um maybe it

846
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,090
wouldn't be that bad i remain

847
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:00,620
nber advising a friend of mine who

848
00:30:01,130 --> 00:30:03,710
was asked to go on celebrity apprentice

849
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:06,740
i was saying no you you don't

850
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:08,660
want to do that because that person

851
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:10,250
was also i don't want to give

852
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:11,780
anything away but that person is also

853
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:13,610
not at the apex of their career

854
00:30:13,850 --> 00:30:15,770
right and i was too soon yeah

855
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:16,940
i was sort of like you're just

856
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:18,680

857
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:19,250

858
00:30:19,933 --> 00:30:21,435

859
00:30:21,435 --> 00:30:22,875
it is penn jillette right you know

860
00:30:22,905 --> 00:30:25,275
because nobody cares ultimately and i think

861
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:26,805
no like i watched james van der

862
00:30:26,805 --> 00:30:28,155

00:30:30,855 --> 00:30:32,205
that he like why would you you

865
00:30:32,205 --> 00:30:33,345

867
00:30:34,605 --> 00:30:36,495
so much it's not so much appearing

00:30:36,495 --> 00:30:38,685

893
00:31:29,955 --> 00:31:31,755
sean spicer oh and he went on

894
00:31:31,755 --> 00:31:32,925
to put out a statement a statement

895
00:31:32,925 --> 00:31:34,875
when they cast sean spicer saying i

896
00:31:34,875 --> 00:31:37,035
had hoped i had talked to producers

897
00:31:37,035 --> 00:31:38,325
and hoped we would stay away from

898
00:31:38,325 --> 00:31:40,515
divisive politics but apparently they didn't want

899
00:31:40,515 --> 00:31:43,935
to do that this year and classic

900
00:31:43,965 --> 00:31:45,765
cars and and i agree like i

901
00:31:45,795 --> 00:31:47,955
thought it was wack as hell it's

902
00:31:47,955 --> 00:31:50,115
wacky so yeah i try

903
00:31:50,115 --> 00:31:51,855
horrible i got into the mass singer

904
00:31:51,855 --> 00:31:52,845
and i was like hey i kinda

905
00:31:52,853 --> 00:31:54,705
like the show and then suddenly one

906
00:31:54,705 --> 00:31:56,325
of the singers took off their mask

907
00:31:56,325 --> 00:31:57,465
and it was sarah palin i was

908
00:31:57,465 --> 00:31:59,115

910
00:32:00,555 --> 00:32:02,355

911
00:32:02,355 --> 00:32:04,065
it's like what are we doing with

912
00:32:04,065 --> 00:32:06,495
that i find that weird just because

913
00:32:07,305 --> 00:32:08,955
i mean and i was the recipient

914
00:32:08,955 --> 00:32:10,275
of it but politics are very

915
00:32:10,275 --> 00:32:12,165
the like especially in an election year

916
00:32:12,165 --> 00:32:15,615
they're very the whole world the eyes

917
00:32:15,615 --> 00:32:17,625
are upon them so what i'm saying

918
00:32:17,625 --> 00:32:19,245
when i say i was recipient of

919
00:32:19,245 --> 00:32:20,655

00:32:22,785 --> 00:32:25,275
watching thirty million the first day but

922
00:32:25,599 --> 00:32:27,555
hey it's not any sense you may

923
00:32:27,555 --> 00:32:29,325

sean spicer oh here's what i wanted

935
00:32:55,395 --> 00:32:57,915
to say yeah this the thing that's

936
00:32:57,915 --> 00:33:00,525
so upsetting about like sean spicer sarah

937
00:33:00,525 --> 00:33:02,745
palin doing a stunt show like that

938
00:33:03,105 --> 00:33:03,795
is that

939
00:33:04,215 --> 00:33:07,005
these people are clowns and we recognize

940
00:33:07,005 --> 00:33:09,975
them as clowns and yet they make

941
00:33:09,975 --> 00:33:12,255
this big stink about being treated like

942
00:33:12,315 --> 00:33:14,925
legitimate people while they're doing the thing

943
00:33:15,225 --> 00:33:18,315
that they're allegedly legitimate for doing then

944
00:33:18,315 --> 00:33:19,755
as soon as they fail at that

945
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:22,485
they just show they prove that they

946
00:33:22,485 --> 00:33:23,955
are clowns and it's like yeah

947
00:33:23,955 --> 00:33:24,525
yes so

948
00:33:26,235 --> 00:33:28,635
why did you get so indignant right

949
00:33:29,145 --> 00:33:30,615
when everyone knew you were a clown

950
00:33:30,615 --> 00:33:32,235
and called you a clown and you

951
00:33:32,235 --> 00:33:33,735
pretended like you weren't a clown but

952
00:33:33,735 --> 00:33:35,475
now you're admitting you're a client but

953
00:33:35,475 --> 00:33:37,455
then sean spicer puts on like the

954
00:33:37,485 --> 00:33:40,005

1008
00:35:22,185 --> 00:35:25,035
is playing the classic eminem's glass invented

1009
00:35:25,035 --> 00:35:26,595
for our boys and world war two

1010
00:35:26,715 --> 00:35:28,455
where are they what's the story ah

1011
00:35:28,485 --> 00:35:30,615
it's because they ah the idea was

1012
00:35:30,615 --> 00:35:32,685
that they were not melt that was

1013
00:35:32,715 --> 00:35:34,275
yeah that was the idea you can

1014
00:35:34,275 --> 00:35:36,405
have a small portable suite that would

1015
00:35:36,405 --> 00:35:37,905
not melt oh interesting i'm like i

1016
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:38,475
just like

1017
00:35:39,765 --> 00:35:41,055
it's like i mean they're classic for

1018
00:35:41,055 --> 00:35:44,175

it for after yeah alright now we're

1024
00:35:53,475 --> 00:35:56,055
going to peanuts peanut this is probably

1025
00:35:56,055 --> 00:35:57,375

1026
00:35:57,375 --> 00:35:57,975
vietnam

1027
00:36:00,645 --> 00:36:02,445
the other side they were a little

1028
00:36:02,445 --> 00:36:03,950
bit hungrier they needed that nut and

1029
00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:05,655
the charlie hates peanut but this was

1030
00:36:05,655 --> 00:36:09,315
probably the second version right because it

1031
00:36:09,315 --> 00:36:11,355
was just a plain npm my memory

1032
00:36:11,355 --> 00:36:12,855

yellow from drunk in a hotel room

1040
00:36:28,727 --> 00:36:30,615
i'll always go for the peanut but

1041
00:36:30,615 --> 00:36:32,205
when the peanuts are stale they're bad

1042
00:36:32,655 --> 00:36:33,975
i've always started letting myself do that

1043
00:36:33,975 --> 00:36:37,515
like recently i eat hotel food oh

1044
00:36:37,515 --> 00:36:39,465
really like the minibar do we have

me are the ones to beat honestly

1054
00:36:56,115 --> 00:36:57,255

middle is peanut butter chocolate pie flavor

1061
00:37:14,205 --> 00:37:15,945

1062
00:37:15,945 --> 00:37:17,475

to split them in it's still too

1069
00:37:31,605 --> 00:37:32,655
much and you have to warm them

1070
00:37:32,655 --> 00:37:34,305
up because the inside was a car

1071
00:37:34,305 --> 00:37:35,205

1072
00:37:36,735 --> 00:37:37,845

1075
00:37:44,385 --> 00:37:45,675

1076
00:37:45,675 --> 00:37:47,235
lot of credit for putting these little

to bite into yeah it's like it's

1235
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:45,010
like you can draw with blackburn um

1236
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:46,600
no but there were these shark of

1237
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:48,640
fruit snacks that were fucking amazing when

1238
00:43:48,730 --> 00:43:49,780
sharks and

1239
00:43:49,780 --> 00:43:52,420
and they come out they were all

1240
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:54,100

1241
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:56,050

special when you got one so i

1245

1247
00:44:04,750 --> 00:44:06,400

came came to the theater late and

1721
01:04:17,230 --> 01:04:18,606
what what happened you walked in and

1722
01:04:18,606 --> 01:04:20,380
would not let me in because the

1723
01:04:20,410 --> 01:04:22,842
the movie had already started yeah and

but with this usher outside he's like

1728
01:04:30,550 --> 01:04:31,990
it's not fair to the other people

1729
01:04:31,990 --> 01:04:34,150
i'm like it is their polynesian it

1730
01:04:34,150 --> 01:04:35,380
is the i know it's their policy

1731
01:04:35,380 --> 01:04:37,090
but that's just bullshit you want to

1732
01:04:37,090 --> 01:04:40,150
make windu something for one minute as

1733
01:04:40,210 --> 01:04:41,710
also people are going in and out

1734
01:04:41,740 --> 01:04:43,390
you go back in time but it

1735
01:04:43,390 --> 01:04:44,920
is score it was when they first

1736
01:04:44,920 --> 01:04:46,960
started the arclight theater like a policy

1737
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:48,430
to curb a certain

1738
01:04:48,460 --> 01:04:50,350
type of behavior right but i was

1739
01:04:50,350 --> 01:04:52,030
meeting other people i was i was

1740
01:04:52,060 --> 01:04:54,460

it for another showing of another movie

1745
01:05:02,680 --> 01:05:04,180

1747
01:05:06,190 --> 01:05:07,480
