had sex last night and i think

115
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,580
there's only one reason to say that

116
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:12,897
to so if you want one actually

117
00:04:12,897 --> 00:04:14,190
if you currently want to have sex

118
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:15,480
with him but she was treated like

119
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:18,240
it was disgusting like a curious phenomenon

120
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,879
yeah you only say

121
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:21,360
if you want to have sex that

122
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,710
person and you could even make up

123
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:23,670
that you had a dream where you

124
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:24,750
had sex if you want to die

125
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,820
too i was like oh i was

126
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,620
put off because she was not ever

127
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:30,390

128
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:32,280
interest in your dream we had sex

129
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,800
you were really into it made me

130
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,180
think you were hot for a second

131
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:38,430
you said you were so happy but

132
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:40,020
it kinda made me go oh well

133
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:42,060
is she interested but then she was

134
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:43,410
acting like it was so gross and

135
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:44,100
it was just like what is the

136
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,800
purpose of this conversation just to make

137
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:48,390
you uncomfortable i don't know why she

138
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:50,160
did that she invited me to a

139
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,900
party once and i didn't go i

140
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,310

00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:57,480
of like a really entertaining dream and

143
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,860

and blah blah blah and she said

148
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:06,780
this never occurred to me to say

149
00:05:06,786 --> 00:05:08,970
before she said thank you for dreaming

150
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:09,480
of me

151
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:13,620

well it's very flattering i was like

156
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,420

157
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:22,800

176
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:58,860

177
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,380
and i said hey man you still

186
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:23,820

were you trying to get ready for

00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,440
to watch wonder woman and you were

196
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,940
like what songs might be in the

197
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:46,380
movie we did by the way why

198
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:48,360
would it be prepared we watched in

199
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,130
order to prepare for wonder woman nine

200
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:51,870
nineteen hundred and eighty four we watched

201
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:54,060
wonder woman nine teen hundred and seventy

202
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:56,970
seven the third season premiere which we

203
00:06:56,970 --> 00:06:58,020
didn't realize was an hour and a

204
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:58,736
half movie which

205
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,030
is more time than we want to

206
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:01,830
commit to with lynda carter with lynda

207
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:03,990
carter but it's the craziest fucking plot

208
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:05,580
first of all i did i i

209
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:06,660
watched this when i was a kid

210
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:08,490
but i guess i didn't realize the

211
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:10,140
first two seasons of wonder woman are

212
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:12,720
set during world war two yeah and

213
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,280
then this third season is set in

214
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,780
the seventies so i was like i

215
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:16,740
wonder how they did that so i

216
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:18,960
watched it and they

217
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,270
i'd just basically like at the top

218
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:23,790
she sees steve trevor her love interest

219
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:25,020
she goes that looks a lot like

220
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:29,160
steve trevor and to son ooh yeah

221
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:30,900
and then she's like this guy i

222
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,160
used to know i'm like for those

223
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,350
two years that were invested in you

224
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:37,980
then suddenly like in-between forty years or

225
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:39,120
thirty years has gone by

226
00:07:39,133 --> 00:07:40,710
and you just basically forgot about him

227
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:42,570
anyway it's a weird way away but

228
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:45,630
then does the son becomes a love

229
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:47,430
interest again yeah it's really weird that's

230
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:50,970
fucked up yeah and then jessica walters

231
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,650
in it which is really funny she's

232
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:55,650
acting she's young she's like thirty probably

233
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:58,200
but acting just like jessica walter which

234
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:58,980
is really funny

235
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:01,530
like the same whole like arrested development

236
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,750
yeah the same whole side glances and

237
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,580
caddy things she says but she's like

238
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,350
yeah she says the banana from the

239
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:10,410

372
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:04,350
just like mix people up like that

373
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:06,180
yeah yeah yeah yeah i don't know

374
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:08,190
i do think it's weird though when

375
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:10,920
like people get recognized

376
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:14,970
as someone else but there but that

377
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:16,620
person also is famous like it's weird

378
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:18,600
to be like like you to have

379
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,800
someone approach you and think you're somebody

380
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,330
else but they could know who you

381
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:22,980
are like is there something about how

382
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:23,880
people look

383
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:26,760
do what i mean like jump tow

384
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:30,450
like like ok my friend got ah

385
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:33,210
um recognized as being someone else but

386
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:35,580
he also is famous right so it's

387
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:37,530
like no i i think what happens

388
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:39,900
is people see someone triggers something in

389
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:41,730
their brain it used to happen to

390
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:43,350
me where i would see reality show

391
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:44,928
people around town and i i

392
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:46,440
if they were my friend yeah i

393
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,850
go hey how's it going then i'd

394
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:49,020
realize oh i'm just talking to someone

395
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:50,940
i saw and really hey what's going

396
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:55,380
on meanie meanie yeah a flavor flav

397
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:56,940
it's only a bus

398
00:13:57,390 --> 00:13:59,100
anyway why is it but it's only

399
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,440
one ie both times that's what it

400
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,110
is i do the whip i apologize

401
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:07,140
you the ne to nini leaks um

402
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:09,210

me do watch me whip watch me

405
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,790
meaning it's a song written by four-year-old

406
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:16,530
but i think it triggers something as

407
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:17,160
cool

408
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:19,770
i think there's something in people's brains

409
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:21,510
of like now she didn't do women

410
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:23,430

it's he's like you see someone famous

449
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:36,948
you've seen on things before trigger something

450
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:37,770
your brain

451
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:39,570

00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:53,190
entertainment at all and arguably like you

00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:55,920

460
00:15:56,970 --> 00:15:58,230

461
00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:00,540

462
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:01,857
with please go to a hardware store

463
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:03,120

it's commonly new actors and famous guy

466
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:11,280

467
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,720

00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:22,894
funny people like let it go and

471
00:16:22,894 --> 00:16:24,390
let people wanting to let it go

472
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:26,700
on no i just think it's i

473
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,890
think there's something about like if you're

474
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:31,080
a familiar face or something then people

475
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,580
are like oh yeah something then they

476
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:34,290
just put the wrong person on it

477
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:36,060
or yeah for sure i've definitely had

478
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:37,950
that experience many times where it's like

479
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:39,300
i know that purse

480
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:41,880
listen and then you realize you just

481
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,620
recognize them from a tv show yeah

482
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:45,840
and it's really it's like you're trying

483
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,910
to place them like did we work

484
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:49,710
together on something did i go to

485
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:51,870

486
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:55,380

487
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:58,380

00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:02,940
that show oh watch me whip watch

489
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:05,280

lorna talk about red table talk so

491
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:14,340
well gee me i just think she's

492
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:16,560
really cool and i feel like she

493
00:17:16,590 --> 00:17:20,610
got raised right even though she's exorbitantly

494
00:17:20,610 --> 00:17:23,190
wealthy she feels like she's really down

495
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:25,470
to earth and she is interest she's

496
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:26,580
an interesting person with a lot of

497
00:17:26,610 --> 00:17:29,220
interest and she i was looking at

498
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:30,510
her instagram and she has like a

499
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:33,090
singing duo with this woman and it's

500
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:35,550
really cool and it's like kind of

501
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:37,440
earthy in this way it's not like

502
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,030
any of the music shit before and

503
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:40,950
as a singing about dirt i don't

504
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:43,470
know what they sing about but i

505
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,550
did watch a little bit and i

506
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:45,330
thought it was really good and i

507
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:46,740
just think she's interesting and i think

508
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,140
it must be really hard to be

509
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:51,000
to grow up not it's not hard

510
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:51,990
to grow up really rich and everything

511
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:53,700
but hard to be grounded in that

512
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:56,250
and to be kind of northshore yeah

513
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,690

where everyone records their part at home

600
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:51,635
and yeah put some together so he

601
00:20:51,635 --> 00:20:53,165
asked me to play this rpm song

602
00:20:53,855 --> 00:20:55,895
and i sort of picked it out

603
00:20:55,895 --> 00:20:56,555
by ear

604
00:20:56,585 --> 00:20:58,685
and i was like it didn't sound

605
00:20:58,685 --> 00:21:00,185
exactly right and then he's like oh

606
00:21:00,185 --> 00:21:01,925
there's this website where a guide teaches

607
00:21:01,925 --> 00:21:04,385
you how to play against myth any

608
00:21:04,385 --> 00:21:07,685
of those songs that dan guy new

york you guitar dan smith cheese it's

610
00:21:10,085 --> 00:21:12,515

00:21:12,515 --> 00:21:14,495
everywhere oh wow anyway so i watched

612
00:21:14,495 --> 00:21:15,845
this and it was fascinating and it

613
00:21:15,845 --> 00:21:16,715
was like so

614
00:21:16,715 --> 00:21:18,935
so interesting to learn the the slight

615
00:21:18,935 --> 00:21:20,615
differences in the chords that you are

616
00:21:20,615 --> 00:21:22,655
picking up a year of like and

617
00:21:22,655 --> 00:21:23,945
like oh well this one needs a

618
00:21:23,945 --> 00:21:25,415
different tuning you know stuff that you

619
00:21:25,415 --> 00:21:27,185
wouldn't even know anyway he's learning guitar

620
00:21:27,185 --> 00:21:29,465
right now oh we should jam yeah

621
00:21:30,095 --> 00:21:32,585
he can play two chords which two

622
00:21:32,885 --> 00:21:35,405
yeah he only needs one more hear

623
00:21:35,405 --> 00:21:36,245
them a lot i don't know what

624
00:21:36,245 --> 00:21:36,725
they are

625
00:21:37,595 --> 00:21:38,975
all you really need is you need

626
00:21:38,975 --> 00:21:40,625
c d and g

627
00:21:41,945 --> 00:21:43,865
well then he'll be he'll be flying

628
00:21:43,865 --> 00:21:44,555
in no time

629
00:21:46,325 --> 00:21:47,525
he's got at least two of those

630
00:21:48,665 --> 00:21:50,585
our friend is teaching him on zoom

631
00:21:50,945 --> 00:21:53,585
oh really that's fun so is it

632
00:21:53,585 --> 00:21:56,165
annoying to have to hear him practicing

633
00:21:56,165 --> 00:21:57,065
a lot i went out with a

634
00:21:57,065 --> 00:21:58,865
girl once and she had the guitar

635
00:21:58,895 --> 00:22:01,475
like she'd bought this really awesome love

636
00:22:01,475 --> 00:22:03,875
is my favorite set of effort there's

637
00:22:03,875 --> 00:22:05,135
an annoying lesson of practice i went

638
00:22:05,135 --> 00:22:07,385
out with a girl once ah but

639
00:22:07,385 --> 00:22:08,705
she had this awesome guitar that

640
00:22:08,798 --> 00:22:10,505
had an amp in the actual guitar

641
00:22:10,505 --> 00:22:12,845
so yeah that's plugged into anything it

642
00:22:12,845 --> 00:22:14,015
was really cool and she bought it

643
00:22:14,015 --> 00:22:15,755
and she could barely play so then

644
00:22:15,755 --> 00:22:17,225
i would play on it and she

645
00:22:17,225 --> 00:22:18,725
would get so annoyed with me playing

646
00:22:18,725 --> 00:22:19,865
the same song over and over it's

647
00:22:19,865 --> 00:22:20,795
like well that's how you get good

648
00:22:20,915 --> 00:22:22,175
so that's kind of the annoying thing

649
00:22:22,175 --> 00:22:23,975
about learning piano because it's like everyone

650
00:22:23,975 --> 00:22:25,475
has to hear me fucking long dong

651
00:22:25,535 --> 00:22:26,735
i know and it's like i mess

652
00:22:26,735 --> 00:22:28,867
up and i'm also with my app

653
00:22:28,867 --> 00:22:28,955
that

654
00:22:28,985 --> 00:22:30,125
i use i have it in my

655
00:22:30,125 --> 00:22:31,685
headphones so i can hear like the

656
00:22:31,685 --> 00:22:33,155
rest of the song while i'm playing

657
00:22:33,155 --> 00:22:35,827
the notes and here's my notes oh

658
00:22:35,827 --> 00:22:37,137
it here's the notes you're playing yeah

659
00:22:37,222 --> 00:22:39,283
see if you're right oh interesting so

660
00:22:39,335 --> 00:22:41,195
cool by sorta sorta like wrong wrong

661
00:22:41,225 --> 00:22:42,545
actually i'll tell everyone what it's called

662
00:22:42,545 --> 00:22:44,015
because someone told me and i that's

663
00:22:44,015 --> 00:22:46,475
how i learned about um but it

664
00:22:46,475 --> 00:22:48,275
is i find it um it's not

665
00:22:48,275 --> 00:22:49,115
particularly annoying

666
00:22:49,115 --> 00:22:51,875
ng when he's learning um but i'm

667
00:22:51,875 --> 00:22:53,105
sure he knows when i think he's

668
00:22:53,105 --> 00:22:54,395
good at well no because he plays

669
00:22:54,395 --> 00:22:55,835
sometimes i'm watching tv and then i'm

670
00:22:55,835 --> 00:22:57,035
like can you not do that right

671
00:22:57,035 --> 00:22:59,285
now i'm watching tv yeah but i

672
00:22:59,285 --> 00:23:00,545
don't really but i also don't want

673
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:01,925
to discourage it because it's like i

674
00:23:01,925 --> 00:23:03,575
don't want to be annoying um it's

675
00:23:03,575 --> 00:23:05,825
called simply piano if anyone cares but

676
00:23:06,545 --> 00:23:08,105
and i play on a keyboard and

677
00:23:08,105 --> 00:23:09,215

at the things before he decides to

681
00:23:16,025 --> 00:23:18,275
learn some guy the same question um

682
00:23:18,365 --> 00:23:20,105

to do oh shoot allow

696
00:23:49,625 --> 00:23:50,585

701
00:23:57,425 --> 00:23:58,295
person or nothing

702
00:23:59,945 --> 00:24:01,655
he wasn't looking at anything i think

703
00:24:01,655 --> 00:24:03,335
he actually started making and then decided

704
00:24:03,365 --> 00:24:04,385
it looks like my dad and then

705
00:24:04,385 --> 00:24:06,455
went with that oh wow do it

706
00:24:06,455 --> 00:24:08,555
like the lady from the hello video

707
00:24:09,485 --> 00:24:11,075
i don't know that she wasn't looking

708
00:24:11,075 --> 00:24:13,295
at anything she's blind in the hello

709
00:24:13,625 --> 00:24:16,895
hello yeah it makes the weirdest clay

710
00:24:17,975 --> 00:24:21,665
richa anirudh yeah um no he was

711
00:24:21,665 --> 00:24:22,865
looking at it and then he gave

712
00:24:22,865 --> 00:24:24,065
me a ball and work with and

713
00:24:24,065 --> 00:24:25,415
i made like a piece of shit

714
00:24:25,415 --> 00:24:26,285
fish and i was like i don't

715
00:24:26,285 --> 00:24:26,465
like

716
00:24:27,545 --> 00:24:29,675
by the way i read behind the

717
00:24:29,675 --> 00:24:33,035
scenes thing about the hello video yeah

718
00:24:33,695 --> 00:24:36,245
and so lionel richie gets to set

719
00:24:36,425 --> 00:24:39,275
and the reveal of the head and

720
00:24:39,275 --> 00:24:41,255
he goes what looks like a chip

721
00:24:41,255 --> 00:24:43,115
this he goes this doesn't really look

722
00:24:43,115 --> 00:24:44,945
that much like me and then the

723
00:24:44,945 --> 00:24:47,615
person telling the story says like so

724
00:24:47,735 --> 00:24:50,735
so i said to lionel like ah

725
00:24:50,825 --> 00:24:54,875
lionel she's blind like but the whole

726
00:24:54,875 --> 00:24:57,275
point of the video is supposed to

727
00:24:57,275 --> 00:24:58,925
be bad is that it's supposed to

728
00:24:58,925 --> 00:25:01,415
be good and yet when yes not

729
00:25:01,415 --> 00:25:02,915
that she's guessing what he told the

730
00:25:02,945 --> 00:25:05,045
person telling the story is fake is

731
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:06,785
like acting like lionel richie is an

732
00:25:06,815 --> 00:25:07,775
idiot for not

733
00:25:07,835 --> 00:25:10,085
getting that she's blind and can't that's

734
00:25:10,085 --> 00:25:12,515
crazy otherwise he would just be impressionistic

735
00:25:12,515 --> 00:25:14,645
but like yeah just enough like him

736
00:25:14,705 --> 00:25:17,045
and it's so off that he looks

i had i almost i don't know

806
00:27:53,495 --> 00:27:55,235

yeah is like i when you said

808
00:27:57,095 --> 00:27:59,174

was i drew comic strips too and

810
00:28:00,755 --> 00:28:02,045

811
00:28:02,495 --> 00:28:03,995
i'm not gonna add this why am

812
00:28:03,995 --> 00:28:05,585

i have this day-by-day calendar of cats

821
00:28:22,265 --> 00:28:23,885
it was just like um musical it

822
00:28:23,885 --> 00:28:26,255

about that was interesting right i just

824
00:28:29,705 --> 00:28:32,195

825
00:28:32,195 --> 00:28:34,415
cut them out and make a comic

826
00:28:34,445 --> 00:28:35,855
under them and so that was an

827
00:28:35,885 --> 00:28:37,265
under them like i would write it

828
00:28:37,415 --> 00:28:38,645
i would write a new yorker type

829
00:28:38,705 --> 00:28:39,669
line under the picture

830
00:28:39,755 --> 00:28:40,938

it would be really funny to to

931
00:32:32,125 --> 00:32:34,015
save it nixon was making a comeback

932
00:32:34,015 --> 00:32:36,595
and make like a fake newspaper all

933
00:32:36,595 --> 00:32:38,725
about nixon making a comeback and being

934
00:32:38,725 --> 00:32:40,975
the greatest president of all time and

935
00:32:41,515 --> 00:32:42,865
anyway so we made like a pretty

936
00:32:42,865 --> 00:32:43,465
funny with

937
00:32:43,555 --> 00:32:45,685
like and i drew cartoon i get

938
00:32:45,695 --> 00:32:47,095
it yeah anyway so we did we

939
00:32:47,095 --> 00:32:48,708
had all these satirical stories in it

940
00:32:48,716 --> 00:32:50,725
all that yeah i don't get it

941
00:32:50,725 --> 00:32:51,025
at all

942
00:32:51,655 --> 00:32:55,525
i don't understand what nixon did watergate

943
00:32:56,035 --> 00:32:59,875
he you got it yeah yeah you

944
00:32:59,875 --> 00:33:01,915
did it you nailed it we paid

945
00:33:01,915 --> 00:33:04,015
he paid a bunch of people to

946
00:33:04,015 --> 00:33:06,835
investigate his opponents to break into their

947
00:33:06,835 --> 00:33:08,785
hotel room why the watergate is going

948
00:33:08,785 --> 00:33:11,785
to sound um why is it

949
00:33:11,815 --> 00:33:14,365
that every other president has to deal

950
00:33:14,365 --> 00:33:17,875
with the consequences we don't have of

951
00:33:17,875 --> 00:33:19,645
what they do like when they do

952
00:33:19,645 --> 00:33:20,815
something oh and it's like no one

953
00:33:20,815 --> 00:33:23,275
ever has to deal with consequences really

954
00:33:23,335 --> 00:33:25,705
yeah nixon only he was the last

955
00:33:25,705 --> 00:33:28,315
one impeached yeah but nothing ever happened

956
00:33:28,315 --> 00:33:30,505
to him um what do you mean

957
00:33:31,645 --> 00:33:31,945
it will

958
00:33:31,975 --> 00:33:34,165
it's like it was marring it was

959
00:33:34,165 --> 00:33:35,485
but that's about it you know what

960
00:33:35,485 --> 00:33:37,195
i mean donald trump was impeached like

961
00:33:37,195 --> 00:33:39,115
so if anyone was not was bill

962
00:33:39,115 --> 00:33:41,065
clinton's impeachment the same is donald trump's

963
00:33:41,065 --> 00:33:43,045
where he just kept going i mean

964
00:33:43,045 --> 00:33:45,509
the president yeah yeah i didn't understand

965
00:33:45,574 --> 00:33:47,365
and nixon resigned to avoid am sorry

966
00:33:47,365 --> 00:33:48,486
to everyone thinks i'm dumb i don't

967
00:33:48,641 --> 00:33:50,365
i don't know about president so nick

968
00:33:50,365 --> 00:33:52,045
nixon was going to get impeached

969
00:33:52,135 --> 00:33:54,445
they end and all of the people

970
00:33:54,445 --> 00:33:56,395
said hey you're going to get removed

971
00:33:56,425 --> 00:33:58,225
if we impeach you yes everyone has

972
00:33:58,225 --> 00:34:00,445
turned against you because essentially the bad

973
00:34:00,445 --> 00:34:02,515
thing that he did was bad but

974
00:34:02,515 --> 00:34:04,225
then he went and lied under oath

975
00:34:04,255 --> 00:34:06,325
about it the cover up was coming

976
00:34:06,355 --> 00:34:09,025
and covered it up and so once

977
00:34:09,175 --> 00:34:11,095
everything came out and and then he

978
00:34:11,095 --> 00:34:12,145
taped himself

979
00:34:12,595 --> 00:34:15,145
talking about it and incriminating and xone

980
00:34:15,145 --> 00:34:17,485
two he taped all of his conversations

981
00:34:17,485 --> 00:34:19,135
say and once they found that out

982
00:34:19,135 --> 00:34:20,695
they're like well we want to hear

983
00:34:20,695 --> 00:34:22,615
these conversations and then he kept saying

984
00:34:22,615 --> 00:34:23,905
like oh no you don't get to

985
00:34:23,905 --> 00:34:27,445
hear him and essentially they subpoenaed them

986
00:34:27,445 --> 00:34:30,055
and and and and he was like

987
00:34:30,055 --> 00:34:31,075
tell you what i'll just give you

988
00:34:31,075 --> 00:34:32,425
the pertinent tapes like

989
00:34:32,425 --> 00:34:33,685
like i'll give you the tapes that

990
00:34:33,685 --> 00:34:34,885
i think you may want to hear

991
00:34:34,885 --> 00:34:35,875
and they're like no we need to

992
00:34:35,875 --> 00:34:38,605
hear them all such a bold wow

993
00:34:38,665 --> 00:34:39,625
hey i'll give you the ones that

994
00:34:39,625 --> 00:34:42,385
i figure yeah yeah so eventually they

995
00:34:42,385 --> 00:34:43,735
heard all the tapes of him just

996
00:34:43,855 --> 00:34:45,985
like confessing to everything and they said

997
00:34:45,985 --> 00:34:48,505
hey you're gonna get removed ah if

998
00:34:48,505 --> 00:34:49,975
you get impeached and so he left

999
00:34:49,975 --> 00:34:52,585
office okay and then forward pardon

1000
00:34:52,585 --> 00:34:54,745
for him when he came out the

1001
00:34:54,745 --> 00:34:56,095
door he was way out the door

1002
00:34:56,095 --> 00:34:58,165
because it would be to the nation

1003
00:34:58,255 --> 00:35:01,375
already been damaged enough and this would

1004
00:35:01,375 --> 00:35:03,085
be like because their their faith was

1005
00:35:03,085 --> 00:35:05,155
shaken in the presidency now we know

1006
00:35:05,185 --> 00:35:07,135
everyone had always just like idolized each

1007
00:35:07,135 --> 00:35:08,875
president or whatever the last thing people

1008
00:35:08,875 --> 00:35:11,425
want now as consequences for someone's actions

1009
00:35:11,455 --> 00:35:12,745
yeah so i'm gonna let him

1010
00:35:12,784 --> 00:35:15,115
go and then ever since then nobody

1011
00:35:15,115 --> 00:35:16,645
has to deal with anything i see

1012
00:35:16,645 --> 00:35:18,235
i always kinda thought other people had

1013
00:35:18,235 --> 00:35:21,715
a worse um punishment than let no

1014
00:35:21,745 --> 00:35:25,465
no no george w bush gets he

1015
00:35:25,465 --> 00:35:28,585
gets minced from michelle obama yeah she

1016
00:35:28,585 --> 00:35:29,755
gets to hang out with l and

1017
00:35:29,785 --> 00:35:30,565
mince pies

1018
00:35:33,235 --> 00:35:34,615
but in any case so why i

1019
00:35:34,645 --> 00:35:36,565
thought i thought you know we thought

1020
00:35:36,565 --> 00:35:37,885
it was really funny to do this

1021
00:35:37,885 --> 00:35:39,745
like five page and now that he

1022
00:35:39,745 --> 00:35:41,605
has a context pretty funny right i

1023
00:35:41,605 --> 00:35:43,435
think it's hilarious and i what i

1024
00:35:43,435 --> 00:35:46,195
love about it is so let's all

1025
00:35:46,195 --> 00:35:50,905
the ways that lampoons yeah really inspired

1026
00:35:50,905 --> 00:35:51,805
by the lampoon so

1027
00:35:52,045 --> 00:35:54,115
it's wonderful the harvard lab yes of

1028
00:35:54,115 --> 00:35:56,035
course no but it was it was

1029
00:35:56,425 --> 00:35:58,375
probably not funny or whatever but it

1030
00:35:58,375 --> 00:36:00,265
was funny to us in eighth grade

1031
00:36:00,265 --> 00:36:02,155
that we were like talking about nixon

1032
00:36:02,155 --> 00:36:03,685
making a comeback and doing all these

1033
00:36:03,685 --> 00:36:05,785
satirical articles anyway so we pass it

1034
00:36:05,785 --> 00:36:08,185
out to everyone ever wanted to school

1035
00:36:08,605 --> 00:36:10,225
made xeroxes of it and i got

1036
00:36:10,225 --> 00:36:11,815
called into the principal's office

1037
00:36:12,445 --> 00:36:14,305
and the confidence to pass it on

1038
00:36:14,305 --> 00:36:17,155
to everyone yeah who knows and i

1039
00:36:17,155 --> 00:36:18,565
think they liked it or they probably

1040
00:36:18,565 --> 00:36:20,125
threw it away some people kept it

1041
00:36:20,125 --> 00:36:21,955
because i think someone likes photocopy it

1042
00:36:21,955 --> 00:36:24,565
incentives to me wow um i keep

1043
00:36:24,565 --> 00:36:25,405
a lot of stuff like that i

1044
00:36:25,405 --> 00:36:26,935
probably have like weird shit like that

1045
00:36:26,935 --> 00:36:28,555
in a box somewhere that you got

1046
00:36:28,555 --> 00:36:30,055
weird shit in a box i remember

1047
00:36:30,055 --> 00:36:31,495
the principal was always like he was

1048
00:36:31,495 --> 00:36:31,795
like

1049
00:36:32,965 --> 00:36:34,495
well i gotta say this is really

1050
00:36:34,495 --> 00:36:37,525
funny really clever very smart and i

1051
00:36:37,525 --> 00:36:39,325
was like hey thanks i'm sure it

1052
00:36:39,325 --> 00:36:42,085
sucked but he's like but the kicking

1053
00:36:42,115 --> 00:36:44,005

1125
00:39:16,825 --> 00:39:18,835
like politics it's very similar with comic

00:39:18,835 --> 00:39:20,815
books where there you know there's all

1127
00:39:20,815 --> 00:39:22,465

1131
00:39:28,945 --> 00:39:31,015
like all these people who've grown up

1132
00:39:31,015 --> 00:39:35,155
reading these moral stories about people trying

1133
00:39:35,155 --> 00:39:36,265
to do the right thing but then

1134
00:39:36,265 --> 00:39:36,985
you realize there

1135
00:39:37,015 --> 00:39:39,295
only into the power fantasy exactly and

1136
00:39:39,295 --> 00:39:40,734
that's what the star trek thing is

1137
00:39:40,734 --> 00:39:42,715
like they like they like the lasers

1138
00:39:42,715 --> 00:39:45,235
and yeah and the imperialism and the

1139
00:39:45,415 --> 00:39:47,305
the fighting and feeling like well what

1140
00:39:47,305 --> 00:39:48,835
if i were a good fighter you

1141
00:39:48,835 --> 00:39:50,395
know but star wars to to a

1142
00:39:50,395 --> 00:39:52,375
certain degree because it's the same thing

1143
00:39:52,375 --> 00:39:53,665
with star wars yeah yeah star wars

1144
00:39:53,665 --> 00:39:56,545
has like so many strong female catholic

1145
00:39:56,845 --> 00:39:57,145
princes

1146
00:39:57,145 --> 00:39:59,515
giulia is a stronger female character than

1147
00:39:59,515 --> 00:40:01,495
you remember in the first movie like

1148
00:40:01,627 --> 00:40:05,335
he's absolutely like not in distress she

1149
00:40:05,335 --> 00:40:07,045
is she doesn't need to be rescued

1150
00:40:07,045 --> 00:40:08,935
she's like very much tougher than i

1151
00:40:09,145 --> 00:40:11,095
than i remembered as a kid but

1152
00:40:11,095 --> 00:40:12,445
because she's not the focus of the

1153
00:40:12,445 --> 00:40:14,365
movie in the way that the guy

1154
00:40:14,365 --> 00:40:16,165
yeah she's on his journey and everything

1155
00:40:16,195 --> 00:40:17,305

ah it's people that think like me

1198
00:41:38,010 --> 00:41:38,640
it's people that don't

00:41:38,670 --> 00:41:40,740
think like me it's people that i

1200
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:43,590
that i trust to retweet things that

00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:35,370
a big baby

1283
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:38,370
she might mistake him for a baby

1284
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:41,518
i just think my parents never called

00:44:41,518 --> 00:44:43,110

00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:49,110
their names i guess the one thing

1288
00:44:49,124 --> 00:44:50,497
that bother thinking it was just so

1289
00:44:50,497 --> 00:44:52,260
scared about my position not talking to

00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:53,070

include

1371
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:43,470
added but then there would be something

1372
00:47:43,470 --> 00:47:44,400
where it's like where you're on your

1373
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:46,440
own for that we always stop there's

00:49:33,330 --> 00:49:35,100
by and going by and it didn't

1429
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:37,110

00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:42,870
of the air conditioning had worn off

1433
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:45,450
and it was sweltering in the house

1434
00:49:45,450 --> 00:49:46,530
and we had none of the lights

1435
00:49:46,530 --> 00:49:48,150
were on and we were using flashlights

1436
00:49:48,150 --> 00:49:49,800
and we were like okay i guess

1437
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:50,640
we should even though

1438
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:52,830
though we don't feel really safe about

1439
00:49:52,830 --> 00:49:54,390
it we can't stay here because we

1440
00:49:54,390 --> 00:49:55,890
won't be able to sleep let's go

1441
00:49:55,890 --> 00:49:57,630
to a hotel than every hotel none

1442
00:49:57,630 --> 00:50:00,060
of them would take dogs and then

1443
00:50:00,090 --> 00:50:02,010
our show gone to hotel for dogs

1444
00:50:02,130 --> 00:50:04,410
that's true do you take humans

1445
00:50:07,110 --> 00:50:08,190
but then the other part that we

1446
00:50:08,190 --> 00:50:09,840
didn't know is we were we finally

1447
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:11,130
were like can we just go over

1448
00:50:11,130 --> 00:50:12,838

wouldn't open so we couldn't drive oh

1454
00:50:23,310 --> 00:50:24,720

1455
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:25,680
out how to open the gate

1456
00:50:26,409 --> 00:50:28,805

it in a tux producer and then

1516
00:52:33,875 --> 00:52:36,126
throwing it to the old host who

1517
00:52:36,126 --> 00:52:38,375

1518
00:52:38,375 --> 00:52:38,855

cheaters and joey greco or something i

1521
00:52:42,215 --> 00:52:43,625
think he was joey greco yeah but

1522
00:52:43,625 --> 00:52:45,785
then the footage they had had the

1523
00:52:45,785 --> 00:52:47,795
old host because the new host hadn't

1524
00:52:47,825 --> 00:52:49,625
done any footage yet so there were

1525
00:52:49,625 --> 00:52:51,924
three fucking notes of what episode

1526
00:52:53,435 --> 00:52:54,125
it was so funny

1527
00:52:55,175 --> 00:52:57,665
yeah it does feel weird to be

1528
00:52:57,665 --> 00:52:59,255
around people and that's when we went

1529
00:52:59,255 --> 00:53:00,215
over to my friend's house it was

1530
00:53:00,215 --> 00:53:01,655
kind of like we'd both gotten tested

1531
00:53:01,655 --> 00:53:03,305
recently so it was kind of like

1532
00:53:03,515 --> 00:53:05,225
you know anyway belt and neither of

1533
00:53:05,225 --> 00:53:06,425
us go anywhere so it was kind

1534
00:53:06,425 --> 00:53:07,835
of like it felt okay but it

1535
00:53:07,835 --> 00:53:10,085
was very weird to suddenly for the

1536
00:53:10,085 --> 00:53:12,245
first we ended up having to stay

1537
00:53:12,245 --> 00:53:13,475
there for two days because it finally

1538
00:53:13,475 --> 00:53:14,975
got turned back my two days later

1539
00:53:14,975 --> 00:53:15,335
date

1540
00:53:15,335 --> 00:53:18,185
a's and for the first two or

1541
00:53:18,185 --> 00:53:20,585
three hours we were pretty like aware

1542
00:53:20,585 --> 00:53:21,815
and trying to wear masks around each

1543
00:53:21,815 --> 00:53:22,805
other and that is a certain point

1544
00:53:22,805 --> 00:53:23,975
it was like this is impossible and

1545
00:53:23,975 --> 00:53:26,195
stupid we can't even do this but

1546
00:53:26,195 --> 00:53:27,935
it felt it did feel risky though

1547
00:53:28,055 --> 00:53:30,005
yeah yeah yeah it felt like to

1548
00:53:30,005 --> 00:53:31,835
me it felt like doing when you

1549
00:53:31,835 --> 00:53:33,455
would in world war two when you

1550
00:53:33,455 --> 00:53:35,435

1554
00:53:40,835 --> 00:53:42,545

1558
00:53:47,645 --> 00:53:49,535
