00:10:48,955 --> 00:10:51,265
the funniest people but in the games

313
00:10:51,265 --> 00:10:52,615

373
00:12:54,805 --> 00:12:55,075
might

374
00:12:55,105 --> 00:12:57,025
not be i'm gonna ask you a

375
00:12:57,025 --> 00:12:58,195
question you just give me the answer

376
00:12:58,195 --> 00:12:59,485
that comes your mind it might be

377
00:12:59,485 --> 00:13:01,765
like a multiple choice thing where they

378
00:13:01,795 --> 00:13:03,475
write down a bunch of things and

379
00:13:03,475 --> 00:13:04,855
then say which of these do you

380
00:13:04,855 --> 00:13:06,685
think is i don't know no no

381
00:13:06,685 --> 00:13:08,305
it's no thanks so i think it's

382
00:13:08,365 --> 00:13:09,535
because some of these things are fucking

383
00:13:09,535 --> 00:13:11,395
weird but because you know why it

384
00:13:11,395 --> 00:13:13,375
doesn't add up to a hundred ah

385
00:13:13,405 --> 00:13:14,935
all the time is because like they

386
00:13:14,935 --> 00:13:15,175
don't

387
00:13:15,265 --> 00:13:16,645
accept any answer it's it's just like

388
00:13:16,645 --> 00:13:18,415
either one or two people saying something

389
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:20,815
so there are you know there are

390
00:13:20,815 --> 00:13:22,765
times when someone just says like one

391
00:13:22,765 --> 00:13:24,775
person says something crazy and then they

392
00:13:24,775 --> 00:13:26,125
don't you know put yes so that's

393
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:27,925
why i believe it's not multiple but

394
00:13:27,955 --> 00:13:29,455
okay so like for the what don't

395
00:13:29,455 --> 00:13:30,445
you want to find and people but

396
00:13:30,475 --> 00:13:33,055
don't like the dog thing nobody's saying

397
00:13:33,325 --> 00:13:34,885
good girl i think

398
00:13:35,425 --> 00:13:41,125
hundred people say ah good girl good

399
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:42,025
boy because

400
00:13:43,135 --> 00:13:45,085
but see you wanna treat that was

401
00:13:45,085 --> 00:13:48,235
on there too said wan chee no

402
00:13:48,235 --> 00:13:52,678
one's hungry slash wanted treat question

403
00:13:53,935 --> 00:13:56,455
dickey others today julie's zippy if there

404
00:13:56,455 --> 00:13:58,285
are enough similar ones they combine them

405
00:13:58,285 --> 00:13:59,755
into one yeah so it's not the

406
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:02,575
wording yeah but i mean it's like

407
00:14:03,025 --> 00:14:07,045
asking so asking your partner if they're

408
00:14:07,045 --> 00:14:10,825
hungry is not the same thing as

409
00:14:10,825 --> 00:14:12,205
asking a dog if they want to

410
00:14:12,205 --> 00:14:14,065
treat but see but if your partner

411
00:14:14,065 --> 00:14:15,175
or is being a collar and a

412
00:14:15,175 --> 00:14:17,455
leash and you only need the mo

413
00:14:17,935 --> 00:14:19,828
oh well also you want to treat

414
00:14:19,828 --> 00:14:21,115
it sometimes you can say it like

415
00:14:21,115 --> 00:14:22,525
desert like hey you want to treat

416
00:14:22,555 --> 00:14:24,655
to know you know and it's not

417
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:26,005
no one has ever either i don't

418
00:14:26,005 --> 00:14:27,595
think people are saying to other humans

419
00:14:28,195 --> 00:14:29,305
do you want to treat them choice

420
00:14:29,485 --> 00:14:30,505
i'm gonna say it every day to

421
00:14:30,715 --> 00:14:33,115
go wanting to make it true yeah

422
00:14:33,115 --> 00:14:34,015
my theory

423
00:14:35,185 --> 00:14:37,945
just like this one treat one tree

424
00:14:38,455 --> 00:14:41,245
until a grieving hungry one lady cheat

425
00:14:41,275 --> 00:14:42,475
what were the other ones always the

426
00:14:42,475 --> 00:14:44,245
dogs that they they step on the

427
00:14:44,245 --> 00:14:46,315

00:16:00,085 --> 00:16:02,695
really his room and also you mentioned

462
00:16:02,695 --> 00:16:04,645
that solomons said we should be playing

463
00:16:04,975 --> 00:16:06,685
yeah um we should be doing stuff

464
00:16:06,685 --> 00:16:07,975
like this like canadian

465
00:16:08,065 --> 00:16:09,385
should be doing more should be the

466
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:10,885
only thing is it was very involved

467
00:16:10,885 --> 00:16:11,515
like i was like there was a

468
00:16:11,515 --> 00:16:13,255
lot of preparation for the game when

469
00:16:13,284 --> 00:16:14,305
the match came stuff we used to

470
00:16:14,305 --> 00:16:15,985
do yeah it was it was very

471
00:16:16,585 --> 00:16:18,325
involved jimmy had to do the brunt

472
00:16:18,325 --> 00:16:20,065
of the work jimmy pardo hosted but

473
00:16:20,065 --> 00:16:21,925
also totally somebody's got to do that

474
00:16:21,925 --> 00:16:24,235
but not easy to do and i

475
00:16:24,235 --> 00:16:25,465
want to show up yeah jerry yeah

476
00:16:25,495 --> 00:16:26,425
i think we should be doing it

477
00:16:26,425 --> 00:16:27,625
all the time and somebody should be

478
00:16:27,625 --> 00:16:28,195
responsible

479
00:16:28,225 --> 00:16:30,235
for us yeah comedian jeopardy

480
00:16:31,285 --> 00:16:34,195
interesting actually it was david really have

481
00:16:34,195 --> 00:16:35,485
to dumb down the questions with me

482
00:16:36,295 --> 00:16:38,395
umm yeah for you i go

483
00:16:40,469 --> 00:16:41,455
let me know because you probably want

484
00:16:41,455 --> 00:16:42,835
the questions to be able to be

485
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:44,545
setups for like jokes a bit more

486
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:46,465
too because i have to be funny

487
00:16:47,095 --> 00:16:49,345
yeah like yeah you'd have to blow

488
00:16:49,345 --> 00:16:51,505
some of your answers on joking what

489
00:16:51,505 --> 00:16:52,735
are the games that would be best

490
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:54,595
suited to comedy this i thought was

491
00:16:54,595 --> 00:16:56,365
good family because there was there's room

492
00:16:56,365 --> 00:16:59,665
around hollywood squares of course the way

493
00:16:59,815 --> 00:17:00,743
the way i want to build that

494
00:17:00,743 --> 00:17:03,505
set though hollow or solid pewter so

495
00:17:03,505 --> 00:17:06,085
funny with like how you're getting ready

496
00:17:06,085 --> 00:17:07,975
to say your answer and the answers

497
00:17:07,975 --> 00:17:10,135
are dumb so it's like that's naturally

498
00:17:10,135 --> 00:17:11,635
funny and then you can riff off

499
00:17:11,635 --> 00:17:12,685
of that but there's a lot of

500
00:17:12,685 --> 00:17:14,695
room around the game play to to

501
00:17:14,695 --> 00:17:16,405
have hollywood squares match camera both the

502
00:17:16,405 --> 00:17:17,905
same where you can say a joke

503
00:17:17,905 --> 00:17:19,465
answer first and then go no no

504
00:17:19,465 --> 00:17:19,825
no my

505
00:17:19,837 --> 00:17:21,625
real answer yeah you know to help

506
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:24,475
the person should do hollywood squares and

507
00:17:24,475 --> 00:17:25,825
well we could we get in square

508
00:17:25,855 --> 00:17:26,995
we could do it at my place

509
00:17:26,995 --> 00:17:29,305
where everyone just like it's three stories

510
00:17:29,305 --> 00:17:30,895
and everyone just yells out one window

511
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:31,645
that sounds

512
00:17:33,235 --> 00:17:34,733
that actually would be really fun do

513
00:17:34,733 --> 00:17:36,865
you know what we should market this

514
00:17:36,985 --> 00:17:38,065
and if you want us to come

515
00:17:38,065 --> 00:17:39,235
to your house if you have the

516
00:17:39,477 --> 00:17:42,175
house that's appropriate for this we'll come

517
00:17:42,175 --> 00:17:45,685
in three story high windows or a

518
00:17:45,685 --> 00:17:47,725
garage can be one of them or

519
00:17:47,725 --> 00:17:48,925
know the outside you could say i'm

520
00:17:48,955 --> 00:17:50,695
a poor showing the ground outside and

521
00:17:50,695 --> 00:17:52,945
then two windows above yeah yeah exam

522
00:17:52,945 --> 00:17:54,355
lately they just have to be higher

523
00:17:54,355 --> 00:17:56,065
than someone sitting down if he wants

524
00:17:56,073 --> 00:17:57,625
to come we'll do it for free

525
00:17:58,225 --> 00:18:00,355
look will travel anywhere for free we

526
00:18:00,385 --> 00:18:02,905
will pay for travel on that set

527
00:18:02,905 --> 00:18:05,035
where was the host and the contestants

528
00:18:05,065 --> 00:18:06,385
they were like off to the side

529
00:18:06,385 --> 00:18:08,275
yeah they up when they raised up

530
00:18:08,575 --> 00:18:10,945
a little bit like an a mid-level

531
00:18:10,945 --> 00:18:12,325
with the middle of the dough know

532
00:18:12,325 --> 00:18:13,345
they were kind of level with the

533
00:18:13,345 --> 00:18:13,945
bottom level

534
00:18:15,205 --> 00:18:18,475
wild wild stuff what i think about

535
00:18:18,475 --> 00:18:20,845
it it makes me crazy that it

536
00:18:20,845 --> 00:18:21,985
would be very strange if they were

537
00:18:21,985 --> 00:18:23,935
as high as the top level yeah

538
00:18:23,965 --> 00:18:25,675
looking down at yeah yeah yeah yeah

539
00:18:26,365 --> 00:18:28,345
um yeah let's do it let's see

540
00:18:28,345 --> 00:18:29,665
yeah let's do it tomorrow

541
00:18:30,895 --> 00:18:32,695
actually i recently played a hundred thousand

542
00:18:32,695 --> 00:18:34,105
dollar pyramid which will be airing at

543
00:18:34,105 --> 00:18:36,085
some point yes i'm so jealous because

544
00:18:36,085 --> 00:18:37,525
that's the one show that i've wanted

545
00:18:37,525 --> 00:18:39,535
to go on forever and they ask

546
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:42,145
you and they never ask me because

547
00:18:42,655 --> 00:18:45,325
i am not in movie i like

548
00:18:45,325 --> 00:18:47,365
that one could be very even as

549
00:18:47,365 --> 00:18:48,685
gonna say no one could work because

550
00:18:48,715 --> 00:18:50,875
yeah you just need the titles of

551
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:51,025
the

552
00:18:51,055 --> 00:18:53,635
thing yeah someone could easily make that

553
00:18:53,665 --> 00:18:54,985
yeah we have the board game too

554
00:18:54,985 --> 00:18:57,235
that we would oh yeah the the

555
00:18:57,325 --> 00:18:58,936
home game as the sky but i

556
00:18:59,043 --> 00:19:00,955

valentina one channel yeah spoiler here wins

654
00:22:23,285 --> 00:22:26,435
against chao the thing yeah the dramatization

655
00:22:26,435 --> 00:22:27,485
of it oh no one watched it

656
00:22:27,605 --> 00:22:29,405
it's like why were you guys think

657
00:22:29,435 --> 00:22:30,725
they greenlit it when it was like

658
00:22:30,725 --> 00:22:31,175
everyone was

659
00:22:31,235 --> 00:22:32,786
talking about that for that yeah can

660
00:22:32,825 --> 00:22:34,475
be right or they started making it

661
00:22:34,475 --> 00:22:35,765
right when it was we all watched

662
00:22:35,765 --> 00:22:37,505
it and we all regretted watching it

663
00:22:37,505 --> 00:22:38,855
and we agreed we would not talk

664
00:22:38,855 --> 00:22:40,025
about it again the one i liked

665
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:42,037
though was ah the i'm all i

666
00:22:42,037 --> 00:22:43,385
can think it was dragonball z what's

667
00:22:43,385 --> 00:22:45,215
the skateboarding one palsy

668
00:22:46,895 --> 00:22:48,155
what is it josh brown and z

669
00:22:48,155 --> 00:22:50,015
boys dogtown and z boys that i

670
00:22:50,015 --> 00:22:52,265
saw the fictionalized version of that first

671
00:22:52,625 --> 00:22:53,855
and thought it was great and then

672
00:22:53,855 --> 00:22:55,625
went back and watch the the documentary

673
00:22:55,625 --> 00:22:56,555
and thought that was great too and

674
00:22:56,555 --> 00:22:57,785
i was like they're equally good but

675
00:22:57,785 --> 00:22:59,315
then people to do the reverse were

676
00:22:59,315 --> 00:23:02,105
like what's the point of this that's

677
00:23:02,105 --> 00:23:03,305
kind of the camp that i'm in

678
00:23:03,935 --> 00:23:06,005
that now camp i am okay

679
00:23:06,065 --> 00:23:07,895
the definition of camp is sim law

680
00:23:09,245 --> 00:23:12,815
the the trend of them just making

681
00:23:12,875 --> 00:23:15,515
a dramatized version of all these true

682
00:23:15,515 --> 00:23:18,935
crime things just feels like it's not

683
00:23:18,995 --> 00:23:20,375
what i don't go on to see

684
00:23:20,435 --> 00:23:22,595
people dress up though isn't it i

685
00:23:22,595 --> 00:23:24,395
think that's worn off for me anyway

686
00:23:24,425 --> 00:23:26,375
really it's like the the novelty of

687
00:23:26,375 --> 00:23:28,745
seeing people play these real life people

688
00:23:28,745 --> 00:23:29,075
is like

689
00:23:29,075 --> 00:23:31,115

00:23:31,115 --> 00:23:31,895

702
00:23:52,055 --> 00:23:53,075

00:32:18,675 --> 00:32:19,725
and i was like i wanted to

944
00:32:19,725 --> 00:32:22,314
be real so bad yeah yeah yeah

945
00:32:22,395 --> 00:32:23,715

that you picture in your mind i

947
00:32:24,885 --> 00:32:25,905

yeah but i don't feel that way

950
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:30,495
and what i noticed this morning trying

951
00:32:30,495 --> 00:32:31,935
to get back to sleep is that

952
00:32:33,165 --> 00:32:36,135
i i can't if if i pretend

953
00:32:36,135 --> 00:32:37,845
to be someone else i think because

954
00:32:37,845 --> 00:32:39,045
they've i pretend to be asleep cool

955
00:32:39,045 --> 00:32:41,265
off since no if i were to

956
00:32:41,276 --> 00:32:43,035
if like if i'll sit there thinking

957
00:32:43,035 --> 00:32:45,645
about things that i'm doing or like

958
00:32:45,645 --> 00:32:46,995
things that i'm supposed to do or

959
00:32:46,995 --> 00:32:48,105
whatever i can never go back to

960
00:32:48,105 --> 00:32:49,365
sleep because it stresses me out my

961
00:32:49,365 --> 00:32:51,135
heart starts to race but if i

962
00:32:51,165 --> 00:32:52,905
like think of a movie that i

963
00:32:52,905 --> 00:32:53,235
saw the

964
00:32:53,265 --> 00:32:55,035
night before something and pretend i'm the

965
00:32:55,035 --> 00:32:57,525
person and just even do the scenes

966
00:32:58,005 --> 00:32:59,655
that were in the movie i will

967
00:32:59,655 --> 00:33:01,785
suddenly like start to dream and those

968
00:33:01,785 --> 00:33:03,675
scenes will blend into dreams and stuff

969
00:33:03,675 --> 00:33:04,755
like that so it's like a way

970
00:33:04,755 --> 00:33:06,645
to calm the homeless like myself dreaming

971
00:33:06,645 --> 00:33:08,145

on and see if it's real in

973
00:33:09,284 --> 00:33:11,505

975
00:33:12,525 --> 00:33:13,335
me back to sleep

976
00:33:13,395 --> 00:33:15,345

00:44:55,335 --> 00:44:56,775

does he have i in my four

1288
00:44:59,835 --> 00:45:02,955

1416
00:49:26,385 --> 00:49:27,285

1417
00:49:27,285 --> 00:49:28,245

mad about this i'm just bringing it

1420
00:49:31,395 --> 00:49:34,605
up to explain pitcher is day the

1421
00:49:34,635 --> 00:49:36,435
problem is that the three of us

1422
00:49:36,435 --> 00:49:38,865
never speak off mike and so this

1423
00:49:38,865 --> 00:49:39,795
is where we have to sort this

1424
00:49:39,795 --> 00:49:42,225
stuff out yeah yeah yeah so anyway

1425
00:49:42,225 --> 00:49:43,725
so then the following week we were

1426
00:49:43,725 --> 00:49:45,255
like okay we're gonna do capiz and

1427
00:49:45,255 --> 00:49:46,725
then we read it and we're like

1428
00:49:46,725 --> 00:49:47,805
no we're not gonna do that because

1429
00:49:47,805 --> 00:49:49,755
it's bad no but k p

1430
00:49:49,845 --> 00:49:52,245
will not be deterred because we told

1431
00:49:52,245 --> 00:49:54,225
k p on that episode we said

1432
00:49:54,235 --> 00:49:55,695
kpi this one needs a little tweak

1433
00:49:55,695 --> 00:49:57,375
needs a little punch up so k

1434
00:49:57,375 --> 00:50:00,015
p to kpi's credit be too there's

1435
00:50:00,015 --> 00:50:02,128
two of them mp jo no yellow

1436
00:50:02,145 --> 00:50:04,965
two k b squared yeah to his

1437
00:50:04,965 --> 00:50:07,725
credit k p ah does he give

1438
00:50:07,725 --> 00:50:09,975
his actual name or maybe hippie

1439
00:50:10,035 --> 00:50:12,915
is katie thomas um anyway so he'd

1440
00:50:12,915 --> 00:50:14,625
be punched it up i haven't read

1441
00:50:14,625 --> 00:50:16,035
this i just saw he punched it

1442
00:50:16,035 --> 00:50:17,505
up and we're gonna decide live in

1443
00:50:17,505 --> 00:50:18,705
the moment whether we're gonna do it

1444
00:50:18,705 --> 00:50:20,265
or an absolutely nuts here okay this

1445
00:50:20,265 --> 00:50:22,605
is junk it there's a timer set

1446
00:50:22,605 --> 00:50:25,515
for three minutes and eternity when it

1447
00:50:25,515 --> 00:50:28,695
comes to stuff like this truly yeah

1448
00:50:28,858 --> 00:50:30,075
truly so what

1449
00:50:30,780 --> 00:50:32,820
so long so but we'll see one

1450
00:50:32,820 --> 00:50:35,250
player is an aloof hollywood bad boy

1451
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:38,100
slash bad girl doing a press junket

1452
00:50:38,100 --> 00:50:40,530
for their new movie than one players

1453
00:50:40,530 --> 00:50:42,960
they're stressed out publicist and the third

1454
00:50:42,990 --> 00:50:50,781
is an entertainment reporter but ah the

1455
00:50:50,910 --> 00:50:52,980
ctr has a silly rumor going around

1456
00:50:52,980 --> 00:50:55,530
about them example a roma tried to

1457
00:50:55,530 --> 00:50:57,810
grow weed in the jungle at rainforest

1458
00:50:57,810 --> 00:51:00,600
cafe that would be silly you're right

1459
00:51:00,921 --> 00:51:03,660
people know the ceiling yeah that's decided

1460
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:05,310
on ahead of time by the reporter

1461
00:51:05,310 --> 00:51:07,470
and is only known by the publicist

1462
00:51:07,530 --> 00:51:09,540
and the reporter so the actor has

1463
00:51:09,540 --> 00:51:11,070
no idea what this rumours the reporter

1464
00:51:11,070 --> 00:51:12,750
is slyly trying to get the scoop

1465
00:51:13,170 --> 00:51:14,640
from the actor but the publicist is

1466
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:15,750
trying to stop them and keep the

1467
00:51:15,750 --> 00:51:17,370
interview about the movie the person playing

1468
00:51:17,370 --> 00:51:19,200
the actor improvises the title character and

1469
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:20,550
all the other details of the movie

1470
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:23,580
if the interviewer can slyly get the

1471
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:25,170
actor to say the rumor within the

1472
00:51:25,170 --> 00:51:27,510

i was given ah i was sent

1526
00:53:08,010 --> 00:53:12,060
to us here a physical game wow

1527
00:53:12,755 --> 00:53:15,180
my god this was sent to us

1528
00:53:15,180 --> 00:53:18,390
by someone named zan toward the magician

1529
00:53:19,740 --> 00:53:21,900
and this is a game called conversation

1530
00:53:22,230 --> 00:53:24,000
the game it's a little pack of

1531
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:26,790
cards and here's how it works

1532
00:53:28,260 --> 00:53:29,970
is the freedom boys and closes the

1533
00:53:29,970 --> 00:53:31,110
game on me with my friends called

1534
00:53:31,110 --> 00:53:32,520
conversation the game the rules are as

1535
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:35,220
follows every card has a conversational rule

1536
00:53:35,220 --> 00:53:36,750
that must be followed pick a card

1537
00:53:36,750 --> 00:53:38,490
set a timer for two minutes again

1538
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:40,800
incredibly long amount of time and either

1539
00:53:40,860 --> 00:53:42,930
a hide it from other players so

1540
00:53:42,930 --> 00:53:44,250
you follow the rule and they get

1541
00:53:44,250 --> 00:53:47,100
your card example lauren has only asked

1542
00:53:47,100 --> 00:53:48,030
questions she's only allowed

1543
00:53:48,060 --> 00:53:48,840
to speak to the players in the

1544
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:50,460
form of question when the timer goes

1545
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:51,720
off scott and paul try to guess

1546
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:53,640
the rule okay okay i like it

1547
00:53:54,300 --> 00:53:55,980
tip if a card looks like it

1548
00:53:55,980 --> 00:53:58,350
won't be fun skip it i like

1549
00:53:58,350 --> 00:54:00,330
to sew right like this tip put

1550
00:54:00,330 --> 00:54:01,200
it at the bottom of the deck

1551
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:03,240
for later here's another way to play

1552
00:54:03,930 --> 00:54:06,510
put it on your forehead headbands style

1553
00:54:06,630 --> 00:54:07,950
so it's in from yourself but other

1554
00:54:07,950 --> 00:54:08,190
player

1555
00:54:08,190 --> 00:54:09,583
urs follow you like these get your

1556
00:54:09,583 --> 00:54:11,550
own clan style it's h e a

1557
00:54:11,550 --> 00:54:12,900
d b a n d z and

1558
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:15,600
then with a little trademark symbol okay

1559
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:18,090
i like this less um example paul

1560
00:54:18,090 --> 00:54:19,920
has flirt scott laura must flirt with

1561
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:21,210
him when the timer goes off he

1562
00:54:21,210 --> 00:54:23,190
guesses his own rule that sounds better

1563
00:54:23,190 --> 00:54:24,900
than the other one i have yeah

1564
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:26,610
yeah okay i liked it better and

1565
00:54:26,610 --> 00:54:27,660
we don't have to we don't have

1566
00:54:27,660 --> 00:54:28,350
to do it in ahead head

1567
00:54:28,380 --> 00:54:30,330
banned because we don't own any headbands

1568
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:32,070
for added fun players can look through

1569
00:54:32,070 --> 00:54:33,840
the deck and assign each other cards

1570
00:54:34,020 --> 00:54:35,460
okay let's try this let's try the

1571
00:54:35,460 --> 00:54:36,690
second one and we'll just put it

1572
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:38,460
