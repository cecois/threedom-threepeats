173
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,470
it was about sounding like your war

174
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,600
auto-tune became a style of it's own

175
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:11,700
everyone from this guy to that girl

176
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:14,040

189
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,520
singer and so do you implied that

190
00:07:41,812 --> 00:07:44,040
i mean like anyone tuning her so

191
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:45,270
because no one knew what it was

192
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:46,440
back then yeah but she's so when

193
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:50,160
she's singing do you guys sound like

194
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,360
a voice which i sadly have to

195
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,280
say i want a part that's that's

196
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,690
what i remember is that one part

197
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:55,440
sounds specific

198
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,600
likely like ne like out in the

199
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,520
open auto-tune like this is an effect

200
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,930
right yeah but they had to say

201
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:03,240
it was like an effect or something

202
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:06,121
they couldn't say autotune because to imply

203
00:08:06,121 --> 00:08:07,890
that they needed to tune her singing

204
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,090
right well if it wasn't already called

205
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:10,320
that at that time i think so

206
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,370

373
00:14:07,575 --> 00:14:09,705
it's a little more because i think

374
00:14:09,765 --> 00:14:11,925
it's it they did that so heavily

375
00:14:11,925 --> 00:14:13,635
in the eighties it's now a very

376
00:14:14,085 --> 00:14:15,945
specific thing like if you watch yellow

377
00:14:15,945 --> 00:14:17,565
jackets and they have all the songs

378
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:19,155
from the nineties it's like this is

379
00:14:19,155 --> 00:14:21,135
the ninety right because that's not what

380
00:14:21,135 --> 00:14:22,065
they were due but they weren't always

381
00:14:22,095 --> 00:14:23,295
the shows where it was zeiss in

382
00:14:23,295 --> 00:14:23,609
this yeah

383
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:26,445
yeah exactly it was very specifically tailored

384
00:14:26,445 --> 00:14:29,505
though towards a generation of people who

385
00:14:30,255 --> 00:14:32,325
all of the sudden got really rich

386
00:14:32,325 --> 00:14:34,485
when they used to be hippies in

387
00:14:34,485 --> 00:14:36,615
the sixties and it's it's for people

388
00:14:36,615 --> 00:14:39,195
who are like now really well off

389
00:14:39,195 --> 00:14:41,865
and have really nice cars to sort

390
00:14:41,865 --> 00:14:43,665

393
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:46,995

00:17:10,965 --> 00:17:13,455
absolutely we've all been in one of

463
00:17:13,455 --> 00:17:15,555
those haven't we but at the same

464
00:17:15,555 --> 00:17:17,895

466
00:17:19,395 --> 00:17:21,045
girlfriend who would use karate on me

she didn't space a lot

468
00:17:25,335 --> 00:17:26,385
she was a pig

469
00:17:27,495 --> 00:17:29,835

00:17:29,835 --> 00:17:31,995
literally a pig than it is okay

471
00:17:31,995 --> 00:17:33,945

that it's okay with a some pig

473
00:17:36,015 --> 00:17:37,035

if it's consensual having get consent from

475
00:17:39,825 --> 00:17:41,295

i was what one year old what

486
00:18:02,325 --> 00:18:04,995
is the plot of charlotte's web ah

487
00:18:05,085 --> 00:18:07,785
ah a spider befriends a newbie

488
00:18:07,785 --> 00:18:10,515
born pig is also a rat rat

489
00:18:10,995 --> 00:18:13,605
named templeton he he considers a fair

490
00:18:13,605 --> 00:18:15,495
to be a virtual smorgasbord yeah but

491
00:18:15,495 --> 00:18:17,625
that's only in the tv version of

492
00:18:17,655 --> 00:18:19,095
i can't really picture the tv i've

493
00:18:19,185 --> 00:18:20,805
ever do yeah it's hard like really

494
00:18:20,835 --> 00:18:22,125
burned in my brain yeah yeah i

495
00:18:22,215 --> 00:18:23,685
saw that when i was young yeah

496
00:18:23,715 --> 00:18:27,217
um and the spider ah the friends

497
00:18:27,217 --> 00:18:27,765
of the pig

498
00:18:27,975 --> 00:18:29,475
and the pig is entered into a

499
00:18:29,475 --> 00:18:32,235
contest like oh first turn killed it's

500
00:18:32,235 --> 00:18:32,355
ah

501
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:37,035
yeah there boy he doesn't know that

502
00:18:37,035 --> 00:18:39,255
when he wins it said in your

503
00:18:39,255 --> 00:18:40,455
just hope your future

504
00:18:41,685 --> 00:18:43,785
just like animal foods the running man

505
00:18:43,785 --> 00:18:46,455
because the the spider writes some pig

506
00:18:46,485 --> 00:18:48,885
in the web i believe in the

507
00:18:48,885 --> 00:18:51,195
barn yeah the pig that that gains

508
00:18:51,195 --> 00:18:53,025
the pig notoriety he wins i don't

509
00:18:53,025 --> 00:18:54,435
know why it doesn't erase spider know

510
00:18:54,435 --> 00:18:56,625
to ride yeah really by the way

511
00:18:56,685 --> 00:18:58,305
the pig didn't do that when you

512
00:18:58,335 --> 00:19:00,075
called charlotte's web and like i always

513
00:19:00,075 --> 00:19:01,665
think the pigs named charlotte and i

514
00:19:01,665 --> 00:19:01,785
t

515
00:19:01,785 --> 00:19:02,745
all about the pig and it's like

516
00:19:02,745 --> 00:19:04,815
it's really about the charlotte yeah sure

517
00:19:04,845 --> 00:19:07,215
yeah doors the girl named charlotte i

518
00:19:07,215 --> 00:19:08,775
don't think no one knows charlotte a

519
00:19:08,775 --> 00:19:12,465
spider charlotte is charlotte is spider the

520
00:19:12,465 --> 00:19:14,415
charlotte is spider i don't think i

521
00:19:14,415 --> 00:19:16,125
could read anything in a web

522
00:19:17,265 --> 00:19:18,825
i bet you could have tried you

523
00:19:18,825 --> 00:19:20,265
know what i was holding down a

524
00:19:20,265 --> 00:19:21,615
web that was an not a good

525
00:19:21,615 --> 00:19:23,325
location i feel a little bad doing

526
00:19:23,325 --> 00:19:24,315
it but they can do it again

527
00:19:24,825 --> 00:19:27,465
and build back better would not go

528
00:19:27,465 --> 00:19:28,275
down i was like this is the

529
00:19:28,275 --> 00:19:30,345
strongest i was spraying a hose on

530
00:19:30,345 --> 00:19:31,425
it and it would not come down

531
00:19:31,425 --> 00:19:32,805
i was like this wild what they

532
00:19:32,805 --> 00:19:34,395
can do it it's incredible how strong

533
00:19:34,395 --> 00:19:36,045
website yeah it's really wild i don't

534
00:19:36,048 --> 00:19:37,305
even think that if i saw wow

535
00:19:37,305 --> 00:19:38,415
eb that had words in it i

536
00:19:38,415 --> 00:19:39,675
would even know it well that's what

537
00:19:39,675 --> 00:19:40,635
i wanted to bring up as i

538
00:19:40,635 --> 00:19:43,035
think i think you would really think

539
00:19:43,065 --> 00:19:45,495
okay later it would look markedly different

540
00:19:45,495 --> 00:19:46,455
from any web you'd ever if it

541
00:19:46,455 --> 00:19:48,345
was like all across a room like

542
00:19:48,345 --> 00:19:52,305
a surprise banner or something maybe yeah

543
00:19:52,305 --> 00:19:53,385
well like that's what the crypt keeper

544
00:19:53,385 --> 00:19:54,465
got for a surprise party

545
00:19:55,545 --> 00:19:58,605
surprise or should i say it your

546
00:19:58,634 --> 00:19:59,505
die

547
00:20:00,885 --> 00:20:05,295
okay carol janney yeah you die but

548
00:20:05,295 --> 00:20:08,233
that's okay i like that i think

549
00:20:08,355 --> 00:20:09,555
i like that game too i think

550
00:20:09,555 --> 00:20:10,695
i did a pretty good crypt keeper

551
00:20:10,965 --> 00:20:12,345
you you did i just yeah it

552
00:20:12,345 --> 00:20:14,295
was it also sounded like carrollton well

553
00:20:14,325 --> 00:20:15,915
those two sounds like this yeah assault

554
00:20:15,945 --> 00:20:17,625
carol channing is the original grip keeping

555
00:20:17,655 --> 00:20:19,695

that way with documentaries in that jamie's

could always be in the mood for

605
00:21:55,245 --> 00:21:57,285

606
00:21:58,065 --> 00:21:59,565
either you gotta spring it on me

607
00:22:00,105 --> 00:22:01,965
or like i have pricey i'm certain

608
00:22:01,965 --> 00:22:04,065
mood yeah like we have to just

609
00:22:04,065 --> 00:22:04,575
kind of fall

610
00:22:04,605 --> 00:22:06,585

611
00:22:06,585 --> 00:22:07,904
looking for something to watch and jamie

612
00:22:07,904 --> 00:22:10,455

613
00:22:10,455 --> 00:22:11,595
say i'm not in the mood i

614
00:22:11,595 --> 00:22:13,815
feel about documentaries to like me if

but like it's like you're what you're

618
00:22:18,855 --> 00:22:20,595
doing is you're committing to watching a

619
00:22:20,595 --> 00:22:24,525
full investigation of a specific topic which

620
00:22:24,525 --> 00:22:24,645
is

621
00:22:24,735 --> 00:22:26,415
very different than just watching a show

622
00:22:26,415 --> 00:22:28,755
