bad no but when you're people the

423
00:14:33,465 --> 00:14:34,665
thing i don't i'm not jealous of

424
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:35,775
us when people are cast on a

425
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:37,755
show that shoots in like canada or

426
00:14:37,755 --> 00:14:40,185
something or another that's so now i

427
00:14:40,185 --> 00:14:42,255
live on facebook she likes yeah but

428
00:14:42,255 --> 00:14:44,025
like not fully like they kind of

429
00:14:44,025 --> 00:14:45,622
still have their place so have a

430
00:14:45,622 --> 00:14:45,705
phd

431
00:14:45,705 --> 00:14:48,075
friend got cast in a canadian show

432
00:14:48,105 --> 00:14:50,685
and once it became pretty clear that

433
00:14:50,685 --> 00:14:53,145
it was going to keep going they

434
00:14:53,145 --> 00:14:55,095
bought a house in canada and moved

435
00:14:55,485 --> 00:14:57,825
their partner up to canada with them

436
00:14:57,825 --> 00:15:00,045
but their partner had to essentially agree

437
00:15:00,045 --> 00:15:03,319
to tar not do anything themselves they

438
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:04,425
they had to just like live in

439
00:15:04,425 --> 00:15:05,865
canada and not work themselves

440
00:15:05,931 --> 00:15:08,235
show was the little turbo yeah that's

441
00:15:08,235 --> 00:15:10,305
right is such a little cute show

442
00:15:10,305 --> 00:15:12,165
i mean i've seen little hobos before

443
00:15:12,165 --> 00:15:14,805
but the littlest he's smaller than anyone

444
00:15:14,805 --> 00:15:15,615
and it was proven

445
00:15:17,025 --> 00:15:18,495
did you know that that's an actual

446
00:15:18,495 --> 00:15:21,645
show oh no i didn't it's it's

447
00:15:21,645 --> 00:15:23,685
one of my favorite canadian references to

448
00:15:23,685 --> 00:15:25,875
canadiana it is um it was a

449
00:15:25,875 --> 00:15:28,095
show from the eighties i want to

450
00:15:28,095 --> 00:15:30,285
say early eighties maybe late seventies early

451
00:15:30,285 --> 00:15:32,775
eighties that was a ah um a

452
00:15:32,775 --> 00:15:36,135
sort of incredible hulk highway to heaven

453
00:15:36,495 --> 00:15:36,825
sore

454
00:15:36,825 --> 00:15:38,865
out of show where this drifter character

455
00:15:38,865 --> 00:15:41,055
moved from downtown but you might be

456
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:43,485
surprised to know let's hope it was

457
00:15:43,695 --> 00:15:45,075
a german shepherd that's when i just

458
00:15:45,075 --> 00:15:49,185
discovered can't so so this dog is

459
00:15:49,185 --> 00:15:51,915
going from town to town by itself

460
00:15:51,915 --> 00:15:54,285
start by itself starring london as hope

461
00:15:55,905 --> 00:15:58,905
colin london that's a show the littlest

462
00:15:58,905 --> 00:16:01,480
london know just how i'm gonna watch

463
00:16:01,515 --> 00:16:03,045
london there isn't a show about a

464
00:16:03,059 --> 00:16:05,597
dog unless it comes starring london it's

465
00:16:05,597 --> 00:16:08,265
not a sitcom or whatever it's they

466
00:16:08,265 --> 00:16:09,795
really gave the dog a title card

467
00:16:09,915 --> 00:16:12,465
this he was the star what i

468
00:16:12,465 --> 00:16:14,415
will say we give it saying so

469
00:16:14,415 --> 00:16:15,465
you would help to reach you

470
00:16:15,465 --> 00:16:16,365
would help someone with some kind of

471
00:16:16,365 --> 00:16:17,805
problem i bet if you asked the

472
00:16:17,805 --> 00:16:19,635
dog over a document like that if

473
00:16:19,635 --> 00:16:20,565
you asked the dog what would you

474
00:16:20,565 --> 00:16:22,215
rather have a title card or retreat

475
00:16:22,725 --> 00:16:23,415
one tree

476
00:16:25,365 --> 00:16:26,745
oh good it's like treats like the

477
00:16:26,745 --> 00:16:31,095
marshmallow experiment yours dad you're gonna be

478
00:16:31,095 --> 00:16:33,195
a famous dog i'll take the one

479
00:16:37,425 --> 00:16:40,185
now dogs don't know they're in movies

480
00:16:40,245 --> 00:16:41,985
but they do know they're on a

481
00:16:41,985 --> 00:16:43,335
set they do know they're in a

482
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:45,285
workplace because they're what their trainer not

483
00:16:45,285 --> 00:16:46,755
their own yes and so they go

484
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:48,525
to a place and they're like okay

485
00:16:48,525 --> 00:16:50,625
this is i've been in places like

486
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:52,215
this before i know what is expected

487
00:16:52,215 --> 00:16:53,895
of me to do but they don't

488
00:16:53,895 --> 00:16:54,585
know half the time

489
00:16:54,585 --> 00:16:56,175
um i won't do it they don't

490
00:16:56,175 --> 00:16:58,185
know the concept of cameras though no

491
00:16:58,185 --> 00:16:59,835
they don't they just see them they

492
00:16:59,835 --> 00:17:02,385
see them as big things shadowy things

493
00:17:02,385 --> 00:17:06,015
but some dogs can watch tv so

494
00:17:06,015 --> 00:17:07,665
they know what tv is so wouldn't

495
00:17:07,665 --> 00:17:10,245
it couldn't they just extrapolate that o

496
00:17:10,275 --> 00:17:12,075
cameras must most filmmakers just because they

497
00:17:12,075 --> 00:17:13,875
watched tv that doesn't mean they know

498
00:17:13,875 --> 00:17:14,685
that it's ninety

499
00:17:14,745 --> 00:17:16,395
tom i think it's a window my

500
00:17:16,425 --> 00:17:18,165
dog will bark at doorbells on the

501
00:17:18,165 --> 00:17:20,565
tv yeah never had a sound that

502
00:17:20,565 --> 00:17:22,245
she's never heard as my dog will

503
00:17:22,245 --> 00:17:23,925
too but my dog will not bark

504
00:17:23,925 --> 00:17:25,605
at voices on tv because they know

505
00:17:25,605 --> 00:17:27,285
it's tv yeah but isn't it weird

506
00:17:27,285 --> 00:17:29,085
that they know that it's if you

507
00:17:29,085 --> 00:17:30,705
have a doorbell on the show that's

508
00:17:30,705 --> 00:17:31,965
like ding dong but you never had

509
00:17:31,965 --> 00:17:33,045
a doorbell like that in your house

510
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:34,905
why should we change up our doorbell

511
00:17:34,935 --> 00:17:36,525
so it's gotta be the pitch every

512
00:17:36,687 --> 00:17:38,625
every two weeks i don't do that

513
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:40,845
because i'm not a fucking freak um

514
00:17:40,905 --> 00:17:42,225
do you really should we stick with

515
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:46,215
westminster chimes can't get enough thing dong

516
00:17:46,245 --> 00:17:49,665
ding dong ding dong ding dong ding

517
00:17:49,665 --> 00:17:52,365
dong ding dong goes on for fifteen

518
00:17:52,395 --> 00:17:53,715
minutes cool

519
00:17:54,945 --> 00:17:56,505
um no but i just would like

520
00:17:56,741 --> 00:17:58,185
for your do you do you think

521
00:17:58,185 --> 00:17:59,925
dogs know what tv is they know

522
00:17:59,925 --> 00:18:01,995
it's a thing that's broadcasting a thing

523
00:18:02,085 --> 00:18:04,305
now my daughter's oh my dogs do

524
00:18:04,305 --> 00:18:05,985
know how good they know that they

525
00:18:05,985 --> 00:18:08,205
know it's bride no say no phones

526
00:18:08,235 --> 00:18:09,783
they know they know they now know

527
00:18:09,795 --> 00:18:11,535
phones because anytime we pick up the

528
00:18:11,535 --> 00:18:13,155
phone to answer a phone call they

529
00:18:13,155 --> 00:18:14,985
think it's us using our

530
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:17,445
our ah front door cam to talk

531
00:18:17,445 --> 00:18:18,945
to someone who's delivering something so they

532
00:18:18,945 --> 00:18:21,345
will immediately start barking anytime we pick

533
00:18:21,345 --> 00:18:22,487
up the phone so they don't know

534
00:18:22,487 --> 00:18:24,795
we know they know it's they know

535
00:18:24,795 --> 00:18:27,795
it's communicating between us and yeah personnel

536
00:18:27,795 --> 00:18:29,994
yeah that's like i definitely know when

537
00:18:30,212 --> 00:18:31,665
they sit and you get a tree

538
00:18:31,725 --> 00:18:34,455

for a year would you go away

556
00:19:11,475 --> 00:19:13,875
right now well we had a situation

557
00:19:13,875 --> 00:19:15,465
where i did what i was offered

558
00:19:15,465 --> 00:19:16,845
a job she mentioned came with me

559
00:19:16,845 --> 00:19:18,645
yes and this was this was we

560
00:19:18,645 --> 00:19:20,865
had just moved in together so it

561
00:19:20,865 --> 00:19:22,695
was a real turning point for us

562
00:19:22,725 --> 00:19:22,995
yeah

563
00:19:23,145 --> 00:19:24,363
you moved in in l a and

564
00:19:24,405 --> 00:19:25,215
you got the job in new york

565
00:19:25,275 --> 00:19:27,075
yes yeah and we'd lived together for

566
00:19:27,075 --> 00:19:30,525
about six months something like that but

567
00:19:30,525 --> 00:19:31,755
all six months and it was it

568
00:19:31,755 --> 00:19:33,555
was a discussion of what how is

569
00:19:33,585 --> 00:19:34,605
what is the best way to do

570
00:19:34,605 --> 00:19:37,305
this do we do we do visits

571
00:19:37,335 --> 00:19:39,435
you know like every month or or

572
00:19:39,435 --> 00:19:40,725
like wow how do we work this

573
00:19:40,725 --> 00:19:42,347
you know but i feel like oh

574
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:43,201
i want the best

575
00:19:43,305 --> 00:19:45,555
case scenario in that you're both actors

576
00:19:45,585 --> 00:19:46,635
not some lift and yoga is a

577
00:19:46,635 --> 00:19:49,785
great place to live it feels like

578
00:19:49,815 --> 00:19:52,148
it seems like it would be yeah

579
00:19:52,185 --> 00:19:53,685
feels like a treat to get to

580
00:19:53,685 --> 00:19:54,945
move there for a job i was

581
00:19:54,945 --> 00:19:56,565
very exciting i'm saying yeah yeah yeah

582
00:19:56,625 --> 00:20:00,435
yeah um but but what if what

583
00:20:00,435 --> 00:20:02,235
if she couldn't what she was working

584
00:20:02,235 --> 00:20:02,865
here

585
00:20:03,495 --> 00:20:07,455
and ah what would you take a

586
00:20:08,115 --> 00:20:11,295
five-year gig where you work nine months

587
00:20:11,295 --> 00:20:12,885
out of the year if it was

588
00:20:12,885 --> 00:20:14,504
a good gig yes i would and

589
00:20:14,504 --> 00:20:15,645
we would figure it out what is

590
00:20:15,645 --> 00:20:16,935
a good gig to you a job

591
00:20:16,935 --> 00:20:18,165
that i would like to do that

592
00:20:18,165 --> 00:20:18,975
pays me good money

593
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:22,575
and if it's ah honestly those are

594
00:20:22,575 --> 00:20:24,885
consideration sometimes i don't think it's i

595
00:20:24,885 --> 00:20:26,505
don't think i've ever had to turn

596
00:20:26,505 --> 00:20:28,575
down something i've never had i've never

597
00:20:28,575 --> 00:20:29,715
been put in that position where it

598
00:20:29,715 --> 00:20:31,515
was like this is very good money

599
00:20:31,515 --> 00:20:34,035
but this job will clearly be miserable

600
00:20:34,065 --> 00:20:35,916
you know because of the project it

601
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:38,565
is the character the role the people

602
00:20:38,565 --> 00:20:40,785
whatever um but yeah

603
00:20:40,815 --> 00:20:42,555
you're always like kind of prepared for

604
00:20:42,555 --> 00:20:44,385
that like there could come a situation

605
00:20:44,385 --> 00:20:46,305
like that where it's like there are

606
00:20:46,485 --> 00:20:48,045
here the upsides to this but the

607
00:20:48,045 --> 00:20:50,895
downsides are many and is it worth

608
00:20:51,045 --> 00:20:53,265
sacrificing this much time of your life

609
00:20:53,265 --> 00:20:54,225
to do it it's like the bob

610
00:20:54,225 --> 00:20:56,385
odenkirk conundrum of like having to move

611
00:20:56,385 --> 00:20:59,115
to to san antonio or wherever they

612
00:20:59,115 --> 00:21:00,945
shoot that in some areas

613
00:21:01,035 --> 00:21:02,655
in new mexico or new mexico yeah

614
00:21:02,685 --> 00:21:04,335
yeah yeah right in and just being

615
00:21:04,335 --> 00:21:05,805
away from your family for so long

616
00:21:05,805 --> 00:21:07,035
and then like trying to figure out

617
00:21:07,035 --> 00:21:09,375
exactly how to navigate yeah but then

618
00:21:09,375 --> 00:21:10,485
you work it out you know you

619
00:21:10,485 --> 00:21:12,375
figure you figure out ah you figure

620
00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:14,895
out the best possible plan you can

621
00:21:14,895 --> 00:21:16,425
come up with yeah and it makes

622
00:21:16,425 --> 00:21:17,865
it not as bad you know right

623
00:21:18,165 --> 00:21:19,905
and it's also like it depends on

624
00:21:20,355 --> 00:21:21,105
you know new mexico

625
00:21:21,105 --> 00:21:24,045
oh it's probably not that you know

626
00:21:24,075 --> 00:21:25,965
like flight wise yeah i'm gonna get

627
00:21:25,995 --> 00:21:28,275
laid probably two hours yeah but i

628
00:21:28,275 --> 00:21:30,765
also think like i find it exciting

629
00:21:30,765 --> 00:21:32,115
to to get to live somewhere else

630
00:21:32,115 --> 00:21:33,705
for a period of time yeah just

631
00:21:33,735 --> 00:21:35,175
yeah you went to england for that

632
00:21:35,205 --> 00:21:36,735
yeah it was like never four months

633
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:38,325
and i mean that was really cool

634
00:21:38,385 --> 00:21:39,915
idea too it was a great experience

635
00:21:39,945 --> 00:21:41,235
i whenever we get to do that

636
00:21:41,295 --> 00:21:43,485
my life and then i know i

637
00:21:43,485 --> 00:21:44,955
never would choose to and i would

638
00:21:44,985 --> 00:21:46,005
i wouldn't even know how to figure

639
00:21:46,005 --> 00:21:47,265
out how to move somewhere for a

640
00:21:47,265 --> 00:21:49,155
period of time like that and like

641
00:21:49,155 --> 00:21:51,075
legally with like visas or whatever i

642
00:21:51,075 --> 00:21:52,875
don't write shit works so it's great

643
00:21:52,875 --> 00:21:54,345
to get the opportunity to go somewhere

644
00:21:54,345 --> 00:21:55,453
and then i also think like it

645
00:21:55,453 --> 00:21:57,435
just opens up your life in this

646
00:21:57,435 --> 00:21:59,565
interesting way like you just don't know

647
00:21:59,565 --> 00:22:01,005
what's coming so it's kind of fun

648
00:22:01,125 --> 00:22:01,425
yeah

649
00:22:02,055 --> 00:22:03,705
there is something to the experience of

650
00:22:03,735 --> 00:22:07,245
living in another country for long enough

651
00:22:07,245 --> 00:22:09,495
where you can feel like you get

652
00:22:09,495 --> 00:22:10,995
a sense of what life is like

653
00:22:10,995 --> 00:22:12,705
there yeah there is a tourist you

654
00:22:12,705 --> 00:22:14,655
are you're having to buy groceries you're

655
00:22:14,655 --> 00:22:16,485
having to you know do the normal

656
00:22:16,485 --> 00:22:18,465
shit you do in life in another

657
00:22:18,465 --> 00:22:21,216
place and getting a getting a a

658
00:22:21,285 --> 00:22:21,585
feel

659
00:22:21,615 --> 00:22:24,045
for that is exciting and fun yes

660
00:22:24,045 --> 00:22:25,215
say you had to move to the

661
00:22:25,215 --> 00:22:27,645
moon for a job move

662
00:22:28,965 --> 00:22:30,315
you are to live on the moon

663
00:22:30,315 --> 00:22:31,485
is all and that let me tell

664
00:22:31,485 --> 00:22:34,035
you the first moon tv show yes

665
00:22:34,035 --> 00:22:37,455
all grey the rocks oh there's not

666
00:22:37,455 --> 00:22:39,405
like a house it's like you're in

667
00:22:39,405 --> 00:22:41,025
your suit but your you can piss

668
00:22:41,025 --> 00:22:42,555
in the suit wait no you have

669
00:22:42,555 --> 00:22:43,605
a house

670
00:22:45,795 --> 00:22:46,965
you have a house but you still

671
00:22:46,965 --> 00:22:48,825
have to plug this out there's no

672
00:22:48,825 --> 00:22:51,285
structure i'm just out on the surface

673
00:22:51,285 --> 00:22:53,055
of the malaria and here's my question

674
00:22:53,055 --> 00:22:53,655
what the moon

675
00:22:54,975 --> 00:22:57,105
is it really because i feel like

676
00:22:57,173 --> 00:22:58,815
that video of them walking on it

677
00:22:59,055 --> 00:23:00,792
you you could probably if you just

678
00:23:00,918 --> 00:23:02,955
really didn't like the little prince that

679
00:23:02,955 --> 00:23:04,695
day if you started in one place

680
00:23:04,695 --> 00:23:06,075
and tried to walk around the whole

681
00:23:06,075 --> 00:23:07,365
thing you could probably do it in

682
00:23:07,365 --> 00:23:09,225
like five hours that's

683
00:23:12,435 --> 00:23:14,985
it's like really trying to try to

684
00:23:15,015 --> 00:23:17,385
like work out video game maps where

685
00:23:17,385 --> 00:23:19,275
they say in real in real life

686
00:23:19,275 --> 00:23:21,705
it would be this um how i

687
00:23:21,705 --> 00:23:23,325
wanna know like the comparison like how

688
00:23:23,325 --> 00:23:25,755
big is the moon i bet it's

689
00:23:25,785 --> 00:23:27,225
it'll let me can we both guess

690
00:23:27,765 --> 00:23:29,325
before you say what it is i

691
00:23:29,325 --> 00:23:30,465
don't even know yeah like

692
00:23:30,465 --> 00:23:32,056
like are we talking about diameter as

693
00:23:32,056 --> 00:23:34,005
i was as compared to the earth

694
00:23:34,005 --> 00:23:36,375
i would say well right i think

695
00:23:36,379 --> 00:23:37,755
i'm gonna say it's one-third of the

696
00:23:37,755 --> 00:23:39,495
earth oh okay i'll do that first

697
00:23:39,495 --> 00:23:40,935
but i'm into compared to the us

698
00:23:40,935 --> 00:23:43,485
because i feel like yeah sort of

699
00:23:43,635 --> 00:23:46,785
slump sweet to visualize around hands across

700
00:23:46,785 --> 00:23:49,245
america from the nineteen eighty six

701
00:23:52,035 --> 00:23:54,135
i remember i have the customary i

702
00:23:54,135 --> 00:23:56,325
had to learn the width of earth

703
00:23:56,565 --> 00:23:57,855
that's what i said yeah that is

704
00:23:57,855 --> 00:24:01,395
what you said nice nice okay and

705
00:24:01,425 --> 00:24:02,745
compared to the usa

706
00:24:03,915 --> 00:24:06,015
okay so the surface number to the

707
00:24:06,015 --> 00:24:09,795
usa actually wait i think we're getting

708
00:24:09,795 --> 00:24:12,585
another i love that song too real

709
00:24:12,585 --> 00:24:14,835
i can't find that song moving usa

710
00:24:14,865 --> 00:24:17,445
given the right wow and i proudly

711
00:24:17,445 --> 00:24:21,375
stand up and stand up next to

712
00:24:21,375 --> 00:24:23,655
you and you see a millennial today

713
00:24:23,715 --> 00:24:23,985
laugh

714
00:24:23,985 --> 00:24:26,115
being back at gen z with parodies

715
00:24:26,115 --> 00:24:27,945
of god bless the usa i haven't

716
00:24:27,945 --> 00:24:29,445
seen this but oh my god it's

717
00:24:29,445 --> 00:24:30,855
terrible okay well i just want to

718
00:24:30,855 --> 00:24:32,295
say that the moon is the same

719
00:24:32,295 --> 00:24:34,155
size as russia canada and the us

720
00:24:34,155 --> 00:24:36,435
combined so it's pretty low pretty big

721
00:24:36,525 --> 00:24:40,125
well big but also small wow this

722
00:24:40,125 --> 00:24:42,525
deep you couldn't walk across it in

723
00:24:42,525 --> 00:24:44,085
five steps like i kind of thought

724
00:24:44,565 --> 00:24:46,665
but steps

725
00:24:49,455 --> 00:24:51,105
but it's pretty bad if they said

726
00:24:51,135 --> 00:24:52,005
if they said hey we're going to

727
00:24:52,005 --> 00:24:54,135
go film the first television show on

728
00:24:54,135 --> 00:24:55,815
the moon i don't want anything to

729
00:24:55,815 --> 00:24:57,105
do with that you don't want anything

730
00:24:57,105 --> 00:24:58,005
to do with it but paul would

731
00:24:58,005 --> 00:24:58,965
you do it you would now would

732
00:24:58,965 --> 00:25:01,155
be tough because janie does not want

733
00:25:01,155 --> 00:25:03,465
to go into space but and so

734
00:25:03,465 --> 00:25:05,325
that's that is a way that we

735
00:25:05,325 --> 00:25:07,905
can't we're halloween to worry that

736
00:25:07,905 --> 00:25:09,135
yeah yeah okay let me let me

737
00:25:09,165 --> 00:25:11,685
let me soften the deal soft in

i think that just a priceless experience

750
00:25:35,175 --> 00:25:37,395

751
00:25:37,395 --> 00:25:38,805
so much when they do these space

752
00:25:38,805 --> 00:25:40,095

753
00:25:40,107 --> 00:25:42,225
cost seven million dollars because like it

754
00:25:42,225 --> 00:25:44,325
is in a way priceless i think

755
00:25:44,325 --> 00:25:45,015
i would go to the moon when

756
00:25:45,015 --> 00:25:45,765
i'm ninety

757
00:25:47,085 --> 00:25:49,425

758
00:25:49,425 --> 00:25:50,865
though because i could die they're really

759
00:25:50,895 --> 00:25:52,725
cool and they could put me in

760
00:25:52,725 --> 00:25:53,985
a tomb if you could die on

00:25:53,985 --> 00:25:56,595

815
00:27:39,525 --> 00:27:41,565
we went to the normal boring church

816
00:27:42,015 --> 00:27:43,965

829
00:28:10,845 --> 00:28:14,775

830
00:28:14,775 --> 00:28:18,045
the members of the church ah wants

and doesn't want forgiveness for it thinks

834
00:28:27,675 --> 00:28:29,475
it's the right thing to do if

835
00:28:29,475 --> 00:28:32,895
you can imagine and so we have

836
00:28:33,405 --> 00:28:34,785
no other

837
00:28:36,045 --> 00:28:38,565
choice but to excommunicate this person because

838
00:28:38,565 --> 00:28:40,155
the person is not saying like hey

839
00:28:40,155 --> 00:28:41,805

yeah it it was so bizarre it

845
00:28:51,405 --> 00:28:52,875
was like it's not like the person

846
00:28:52,875 --> 00:28:54,675
got a divorce and felt bad about

847
00:28:54,675 --> 00:28:56,175
it and asked for forgiveness it's this

848
00:28:56,175 --> 00:28:58,065
person who's planning on getting a divorce

849
00:28:58,065 --> 00:29:00,345
sees there's thinks there's nothing wrong with

850
00:29:00,345 --> 00:29:02,895
it and therefore we need to we

851
00:29:02,895 --> 00:29:03,075
need

852
00:29:03,105 --> 00:29:04,725
to punish them and show that they

853
00:29:04,725 --> 00:29:06,735

picard moving back to get back into

1153
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:27,880

in all the details yeah yeah that's

1269
00:46:30,460 --> 00:46:32,350

i was like i would ap i

1312
00:47:50,950 --> 00:47:51,610
would do that in a heart

1313
00:47:51,714 --> 00:47:52,570
we should explain it

1314
00:47:53,770 --> 00:47:57,430
yeah it's basically just basically people who

1315
00:47:57,610 --> 00:47:59,650
were all in high school together in

1316
00:47:59,650 --> 00:48:01,960
a play in a musical usually they

1317
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:04,720
get back together decades later to redo

1318
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:07,630
the play now when when we first

1319
00:48:07,630 --> 00:48:10,480
heard the idea jamie thought they did

1320
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:13,090
it like on fucking broadway like a

1321
00:48:13,090 --> 00:48:13,930
mounted like oh they

1322
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:16,690
doing a full professional like for one

1323
00:48:16,690 --> 00:48:18,580
night obviously but like it was that

1324
00:48:18,580 --> 00:48:20,170
they were gonna do a full professional

1325
00:48:20,170 --> 00:48:21,670
version what do they do they don't

1326
00:48:21,670 --> 00:48:23,470
do it in the actual high school

1327
00:48:23,470 --> 00:48:25,450
yeah well that made that's what i

1328
00:48:25,450 --> 00:48:27,850
expected yeah but i felt like b'day

1329
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:30,970
they try they do the daily bring

1330
00:48:30,973 --> 00:48:33,400
in like broadway performers as ringers to

1331
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:34,090
be like

1332
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:36,880
the chorus sometimes yeah so it's and

1333
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:38,350
they and they do a full set

1334
00:48:38,350 --> 00:48:39,610
and they do like a major pro

1335
00:48:39,610 --> 00:48:41,380
i can't wait to yeah today they

1336
00:48:41,380 --> 00:48:42,880
like track down all the speaking like

1337
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:44,950
whoever had speaking roles and there's they're

1338
00:48:44,950 --> 00:48:46,600
really interesting things of like oh this

1339
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:48,280
guy was one of the leads of

1340
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:50,650
oklahoman was a great dancer but now

1341
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:53,710
he's in a wheelchair and so how

1342
00:48:53,710 --> 00:48:54,250
is he going to

1343
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:56,680
adapt you know and like delves into

1344
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:59,860
the the beefs behind performers or like

1345
00:48:59,860 --> 00:49:01,660
the people who used to be in

1346
00:49:01,660 --> 00:49:03,490
a romance who broke up and why

1347
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:04,630
did they break up and all the

1348
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:06,640
stuff it's really it's really good and

1349
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:07,810
i was like oh yeah would i

1350
00:49:07,810 --> 00:49:09,340
do it ah you know i went

1351
00:49:09,340 --> 00:49:11,200
to like oh yeah that's your dream

1352
00:49:11,230 --> 00:49:12,070
i went to the school of the

1353
00:49:12,070 --> 00:49:13,337
arts and i was like

1354
00:49:14,410 --> 00:49:15,850
and you would love to do that

1355
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,590
well the mary poppins the girl who

1356
00:49:17,590 --> 00:49:19,480
played mary poppins she like went to

1357
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:21,460
broadway and got a tony nomination from

1358
00:49:21,460 --> 00:49:23,380
it and it's like it's wild how

1359
00:49:23,380 --> 00:49:25,690
many of them did not pursue like

1360
00:49:25,690 --> 00:49:27,040
this is not that wild but yeah

1361
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:30,580
hardly any of them actually pursued showbiz

1362
00:49:30,580 --> 00:49:32,770
after that yeah yeah well they're all

1363
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:34,570
also in different states which

1364
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:36,430
i think is another impediment of like

1365
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:38,020
there are certain people who were like

1366
00:49:38,740 --> 00:49:40,360
i decided to do it i moved

1367
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:43,120
to new york i tried and and

1368
00:49:43,150 --> 00:49:45,190
you know i it just didn't work

1369
00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:47,890
out after yeah fiverr eight years there

1370
00:49:47,890 --> 00:49:48,970
are some people who are still trying

1371
00:49:48,970 --> 00:49:50,770
to do yeah you're racing and they're

1372
00:49:50,770 --> 00:49:52,180
and they're the people they're the people

1373
00:49:52,180 --> 00:49:53,110
who come in and they're sort of

1374
00:49:53,110 --> 00:49:54,730
like like

1375
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:55,930
oh i'm going to be really good

1376
00:49:55,930 --> 00:49:58,390
in this and there and sometimes they're

1377
00:49:58,390 --> 00:50:00,910
not it's what you do it i

1378
00:50:00,910 --> 00:50:01,806
would probably do it i mean if

1379
00:50:01,810 --> 00:50:03,160
you were the right show i mean

1380
00:50:03,190 --> 00:50:05,020
like if it were like i said

1381
00:50:05,020 --> 00:50:07,150
the mary poppins was fun i would

1382
00:50:07,150 --> 00:50:08,230
do that and that had like a

1383
00:50:08,230 --> 00:50:09,790
guy who was on a nickelodeon show

1384
00:50:09,790 --> 00:50:13,180
was burt and but even the ones

1385
00:50:13,180 --> 00:50:14,650
from from the high school yeah he

1386
00:50:14,650 --> 00:50:14,830
was

1387
00:50:15,010 --> 00:50:16,600
yeah yeah so that one is like

1388
00:50:16,780 --> 00:50:18,700
those guys were really good like yeah

1389
00:50:18,730 --> 00:50:19,750
like it was the school of the

1390
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:21,850
arts so like susan egan is who

1391
00:50:21,850 --> 00:50:24,220
i'm talking about she she ah like

1392
00:50:24,220 --> 00:50:26,260
voice disney cartoons and she was oh

1393
00:50:26,290 --> 00:50:27,610
yeah hitting the beast on broadway and

1394
00:50:27,610 --> 00:50:29,380
got a tony lash like she was

1395
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:32,140
mary poppins and she was like professional

1396
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:34,390
grade yeah like great you know this

1397
00:50:34,390 --> 00:50:35,050
was high school age

1398
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:36,610
this is high school yeah so we

1399
00:50:36,610 --> 00:50:39,220
were all seventeen and and bert was

1400
00:50:39,580 --> 00:50:41,500
this guy david sedona who is also

1401
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:43,420
like the best and you know like

1402
00:50:43,450 --> 00:50:45,520
ah went into a nickelodeon show out

1403
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:47,680
of that right and so like yeah

1404
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:48,940
i don't think it would be that

1405
00:50:48,940 --> 00:50:50,650
different you know like they would all

1406
00:50:50,650 --> 00:50:51,640
be just as good as they were

1407
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:53,260
back then i mean for having seen

1408
00:50:53,260 --> 00:50:55,150
it i would i would do

1409
00:50:55,875 --> 00:50:57,525
and that of all the shows that

1410
00:50:57,525 --> 00:51:00,495
we did that was the most fun

1411
00:51:00,705 --> 00:51:02,475
i think the and also the one

1412
00:51:02,475 --> 00:51:04,545
i could bear like to do again

1413
00:51:04,545 --> 00:51:06,225
