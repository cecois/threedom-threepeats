he said we should go on the

188
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,100
dating game we would watch the dating

189
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,570
game at his apartment and he was

190
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:23,670
like we got to go and we

191
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:26,910
can win a trip um to to

192
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:28,770
wherever they would give trips to hawaii

193
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:31,740
usually actually a year after this story

194
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:32,640
takes place i

195
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:34,650
start dating a girl who and who

196
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:36,210
went on the dating game as the

197
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:38,670
person who picked and went to hawaii

198
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:41,610
and never spoke to her date ever

199
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:43,050
on the trip to hawaii just hung

200
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:44,640
out with the chaperone having to go

201
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,320
on the date having to go with

202
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,910
the date to hawaii seems like a

203
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:49,920
tall order yeah exactly but they send

204
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,960
to chaperones so that you're not stuck

205
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:52,770
with some weirdo

206
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,260
who assaults you and so she keeps

207
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:56,910
the whole thing she just it but

208
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:58,770
it was a woman parsers she just

209
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:00,270
hung out with the chaperoning okay so

210
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:02,970
that was i love chaperones yes so

211
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,400
that's my kink so frank and i

212
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:07,380
were like our shepherds cooks

213
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:11,970
ah now this is a great philosophical

214
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:15,090
question are all chaperones cooks by their

215
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,980
very nature because even if you're a

216
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:18,240
shepherd at a school dance you're just

217
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,730
watching people grind that's right and the

218
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:22,590
chapter on traditionally somebody who wants to

219
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:24,180
be with the person or people they're

220
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:26,460
chaperoning i don't see i mean if

221
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:27,480
i were a chaperone i don't see

222
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:28,560
nothing wrong with a little bump

223
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,290
and grind personally but hey publish several

224
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:32,610
i don't see death row a little

225
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:33,990
upgrade i don't think you're going to

226
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:35,820
be selected as a chaperone anytime soon

227
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:38,640
okay alright ah hey i'm i'm scott

228
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,080
i don't know anyone at this school

229
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,730
but i don't see anything wrong with

230
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:44,070
a little bump and grind okay just

231
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:46,200
trying to apply to a chaperone all

232
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,190
over the school system

233
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:51,030
so frank frank was really adamant and

234
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,850
i was kinda like his girl friday

235
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:57,060
is my good friend frank barber he

236
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,080
was really out of it which and

237
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,250
frank by the way i should mention

238
00:08:59,250 --> 00:08:59,640
frank

239
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,480
isn't was and probably is a really

240
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,279
good looking guy like like all the

241
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,290

ah sorry failure sure

245
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,130

246
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:18,240
who is gonna go on dating game

247
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,980
and do well and i was like

248
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:22,050
you know he wanted me to come

249
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:23,880
along for moral support or whatever or

250
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,530
or he genuinely thought i might do

251
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:27,510
well but i feel like i sabotage

252
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:29,640
my chances because i dress like morrissey

253
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:32,790
essentially were a cardigan and these big

254
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:34,080

260
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:49,950

261
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:51,990
there and they they put us in

262
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:54,240

268
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:09,150

00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:17,160
diaries

299
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:21,360
um i imagine i did relatively well

300
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,620
in the talking part of it but

301
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:23,610
there was no way i was going

302
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:24,810
to get cast looking the way i

303
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:26,910
looked because everyone everyone this is i

304
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:28,140
mean this is nineteen eighty eight and

305
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:30,600
everyone is wearing like super open shirts

306
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,520
and his huge think they're all huh

307
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:33,930
can you believe he had to be

308
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:38,310
in that time yeah so the only

309
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:38,520
other

310
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:41,370
are things that i remember is finally

311
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:43,260
when they revealed who was behind the

312
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:43,920
partition

313
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,790
and they opened they opened up the

314
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:50,940
partition and it was a really beautiful

315
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:52,620
woman and everyone applauded

316
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:57,150
yeah like whoa we never expected she's

317
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:00,210

320
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,960
on and neither did frank weirdly enough

321
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:07,800

00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:11,760
as you could you basically were touching

449
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,380
the person in front of you like

450
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:15,150

452
00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:20,460

455
00:16:23,427 --> 00:16:25,320
so go together

456
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:27,540
oh so there was no ability to

457
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:29,190

458
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:30,720

00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,170
erection

460
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:36,360
so there were there were these like

461
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,940
three or four judge people i know

462
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,049

the judge dredd ah and so we

467
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:55,710
like then you they would pass a

468
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,570
mike around the room and then you'd

469
00:16:57,626 --> 00:16:59,670
turn your head out from your perfectly

470
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:02,790

say here name age height and weight

472
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:07,470
and um i remember a

473
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,900
same time they also need yeah they're

474
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:11,070
like we got a couple

475
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:13,770
but they would be zooming a camera

476
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:15,720
in across the room on each person

477
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,819
as this happened and i remember it

478
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:18,900
being really weird because there were a

479
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:20,190
lot of girls there who were like

480
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:22,599
five four and i was like this

481
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:25,890
before before they changed the rules that's

482
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:27,810
right i forgot about that because there

483
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:29,730
was a rule about height yeah i

484
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:31,440
kept i was sitting there going this

485
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,160
is not even

486
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:34,590
fare like that like i'm squished in

487
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:35,940
here and like half these people aren't

488
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:37,230
even tall enough to get on like

489
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:38,820
it's just like rick yeah yeah and

490
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:40,530
but besides being tall is your thing

491
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:43,380
well it's just only mine just me

492
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,590
and then they picked the way they

493
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:48,240
go like ok number forty two one

494
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,550
hundred twenty thirty five and then like

495
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:51,750
that was it they picked like a

496
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:52,440
few people

497
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:53,250
from it and then they got a

498
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:54,330
whole new batch coming in and that

499
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:55,290
was the end of my journey and

500
00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:57,630
i was oh my god but you

501
00:17:57,630 --> 00:17:59,340
had a video package right when you

502
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:01,200
look up from your journey yeah yeah

503
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:04,380
so it's compelling um and it also

504
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:05,700
your story was also reminding me i

505
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,860

506
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:10,141

and do it

510
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,890
with her and it was like this

511
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:16,050
weird open call thing it was it

523
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:38,040

00:25:47,365 --> 00:25:50,005
no from the from the crowd and

742
00:25:50,005 --> 00:25:51,205
they were not supposed to do this

743
00:25:51,205 --> 00:25:52,645
but the person that i'd made laugh

744
00:25:52,645 --> 00:25:53,575
in the audition

745
00:25:53,995 --> 00:25:56,095
was my contestant they were never supposed

746
00:25:56,095 --> 00:25:57,925
to lie yeah and so she already

747
00:25:57,925 --> 00:25:58,975
knew what i was going to be

748
00:25:58,975 --> 00:26:00,175
doing and so i knew you were

749
00:26:00,175 --> 00:26:02,215
the funniest guy in the world but

750
00:26:02,322 --> 00:26:03,475
you blew it because she was like

751
00:26:03,475 --> 00:26:05,305
that's not funny anymore yeah so i

752
00:26:05,425 --> 00:26:06,565
i don't think i made her laugh

753
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:07,975
in in on that show but i

754
00:26:07,975 --> 00:26:10,435
ended up doing doing three episodes dead

755
00:26:10,915 --> 00:26:11,815
i don't they should have had the

756
00:26:11,815 --> 00:26:13,735
contestants be mixed into for the warm

757
00:26:13,735 --> 00:26:16,255
yup it's like you should not be

758
00:26:16,255 --> 00:26:17,485
privy to it anyone to do it

759
00:26:17,485 --> 00:26:18,595
should be like the people on the

760
00:26:18,595 --> 00:26:21,835
staff for whatever people don't stuff to

761
00:26:21,835 --> 00:26:22,465
eat on it

762
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:25,315
but i do the other part i

763
00:26:25,315 --> 00:26:27,565
remember about that audition is like the

764
00:26:27,835 --> 00:26:30,985
the executive coming up to me and

765
00:26:30,985 --> 00:26:32,605
going like hey you guys really funny

766
00:26:32,605 --> 00:26:33,925
and no one else is getting cast

767
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:35,245
but you guys are

768
00:26:36,325 --> 00:26:39,325
and in front of everyone yeah well

769
00:26:39,325 --> 00:26:41,365
to off to the side right and

770
00:26:41,395 --> 00:26:43,495
and because i was a new you

771
00:26:43,495 --> 00:26:45,325

772
00:26:45,355 --> 00:26:48,685
oh wow this comedy central executive who

773
00:26:48,685 --> 00:26:50,605
is probably like what a twenty eight

774
00:26:50,605 --> 00:26:52,855
year old dude yeah you know yeah

775
00:26:53,035 --> 00:26:54,775

776
00:26:54,775 --> 00:26:56,425

777
00:26:56,485 --> 00:26:59,125
career yeah here you are now with

778
00:26:59,125 --> 00:27:00,955
us yeah here you are out with

779
00:27:00,955 --> 00:27:03,025
us do you have thoughts about that

780
00:27:03,025 --> 00:27:04,885
like well like now like if so

781
00:27:04,885 --> 00:27:06,589
if that person kept you now and

782
00:27:06,589 --> 00:27:08,785
you had the perspective of your just

783
00:27:08,815 --> 00:27:10,765
a younger person who's telling me this

784
00:27:10,765 --> 00:27:13,165
or whatever like does that change like

785
00:27:13,165 --> 00:27:14,669
does that change for you i mean

786
00:27:14,669 --> 00:27:15,925
it's also being in the business longer

787
00:27:15,925 --> 00:27:16,615
and things but like when

788
00:27:16,645 --> 00:27:18,775
someone's younger than you in a position

789
00:27:18,805 --> 00:27:21,445
is that weird i find it weird

790
00:27:21,445 --> 00:27:22,827
when someone's way younger than me it

791
00:27:22,827 --> 00:27:24,775
is sometimes i remember having a meeting

792
00:27:24,775 --> 00:27:26,875
i had a pitch meeting and i

793
00:27:26,875 --> 00:27:29,275
went into aa to pitch this show

794
00:27:29,305 --> 00:27:32,995
and it was two young women and

795
00:27:32,995 --> 00:27:34,255
one i had met before when i

796
00:27:34,255 --> 00:27:36,655
had not met before and they were

797
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:36,775
they

798
00:27:36,775 --> 00:27:37,915
they were like i think they were

799
00:27:37,915 --> 00:27:39,865
both in their twenties and yeah so

800
00:27:39,865 --> 00:27:41,065
i'm pitching it in but which was

801
00:27:41,065 --> 00:27:43,225
fine but then like at a certain

802
00:27:43,225 --> 00:27:46,105
point ah the just for laughs festival

803
00:27:46,105 --> 00:27:48,505
came up and i think i said

804
00:27:48,505 --> 00:27:51,477
gfl and i said to the person

805
00:27:51,477 --> 00:27:53,695
and i didn't know ah just for

806
00:27:53,695 --> 00:27:55,911
laughs and she went yeah no it

807
00:27:55,911 --> 00:27:56,875
just flashes i've been

808
00:27:56,935 --> 00:27:59,275
there i've been there many times yeah

809
00:27:59,275 --> 00:28:01,285
and i was like inside i have

810
00:28:01,285 --> 00:28:02,515
not even done the pitch yet and

811
00:28:02,515 --> 00:28:05,185
this is over yeah yeah and it

812
00:28:05,245 --> 00:28:07,855
was ah yeah but i like that

813
00:28:07,855 --> 00:28:09,565
you sign it's pronounced shuffle

814
00:28:11,125 --> 00:28:12,535
but that's like her insecurity for being

815
00:28:12,535 --> 00:28:14,725
young like you know like no i

816
00:28:14,725 --> 00:28:15,955
am established i do know what this

817
00:28:15,955 --> 00:28:17,335
is and oh yeah so it goes

818
00:28:17,335 --> 00:28:19,195
both ways but yeah yeah i don't

819
00:28:19,195 --> 00:28:20,935
mind it i love youth and it

820
00:28:20,935 --> 00:28:23,155
just makes me feel figure-eight anytime i'm

821
00:28:23,155 --> 00:28:24,355
in a room with it and i

822
00:28:24,415 --> 00:28:26,065
don't like young people but i do

823
00:28:26,065 --> 00:28:27,655
like their blood which is helping me

824
00:28:27,655 --> 00:28:30,625

864
00:29:54,895 --> 00:29:57,655
um you know and as everyone knows

866
00:29:59,335 --> 00:30:00,775
right now but when i had my

867
00:30:00,775 --> 00:30:02,755

your second shot is always had yeah

869
00:30:06,205 --> 00:30:07,645
but i'm i'm not at the point

870
00:30:07,645 --> 00:30:10,075
of it being fully right whatever you

871
00:30:10,075 --> 00:30:11,545
have an couple weeks or so have

872
00:30:11,545 --> 00:30:12,745
another week another way

873
00:30:14,095 --> 00:30:15,685
but it's making me feel better just

874
00:30:15,685 --> 00:30:16,945
to know that i have it yeah

875
00:30:17,005 --> 00:30:17,905
yeah like i had to go do

876
00:30:17,905 --> 00:30:19,975
a voice over job in person yesterday

877
00:30:20,005 --> 00:30:20,935
but they had it set up where

878
00:30:20,935 --> 00:30:23,335
actually i walked straight from the outdoors

879
00:30:23,335 --> 00:30:25,285
into like the area where i would

880
00:30:25,285 --> 00:30:26,845
be recording and i never interacted with

881
00:30:26,845 --> 00:30:28,495
a person even breathing the same air

882
00:30:28,525 --> 00:30:29,815
so you like how to set up

883
00:30:29,815 --> 00:30:31,645
where you went from outdoors to indoors

884
00:30:31,855 --> 00:30:33,266
interesting yeah but i didn't talk to

885
00:30:33,266 --> 00:30:34,105
a lobby or go

886
00:30:34,810 --> 00:30:36,280
booth boothroyd the guy is and then

887
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,870
go damn you straight into the break

888
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:42,040
um and it was just nice just

889
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,630
to feel like oh it's not as

890
00:30:43,630 --> 00:30:46,930
scary so i'm getting i'm like slowly

891
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,730
experiencing that but i do feel like

892
00:30:48,730 --> 00:30:50,050
because i i waited a bit to

893
00:30:50,050 --> 00:30:52,330
get it that it's like everyone's living

894
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:54,580
so fully i'm kind of like

895
00:30:54,910 --> 00:30:57,520
just not there yet and that's been

896
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:59,470
comfortable for me but also just weird

897
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:01,540
so i'm i'm looking forward to being

898
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:02,830
able to just go like do all

899
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:04,690
my little things and have to make

900
00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:07,120
some appointments and also see people i

901
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,770
mean i don't know i'm like i

902
00:31:08,770 --> 00:31:10,690
got invited to a pool party on

903
00:31:10,690 --> 00:31:12,605
the fourth of july and i i

904
00:31:12,781 --> 00:31:13,960
mean if i had had my baby

905
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:14,710
by then i'm like

906
00:31:15,130 --> 00:31:17,020
maybe well maybe maybe

907
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:19,630
cool party and they'll be fun to

908
00:31:19,630 --> 00:31:21,640
see people and like have a moment

909
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,830
that feels normal for a sucker which

910
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:25,900
could be great i feel like i'm

911
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:27,670
back already you know any mean like

912
00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:30,280
i feel i feel like i'm just

913
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:33,130
ready to do normal things again and

914
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:34,600
it's it's kind of i'm now at

915
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,190
a point where it's kind of surprising

916
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,350
when other people

917
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:40,144

918
00:31:40,144 --> 00:31:42,040
the mass monday was lifted i still

919
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:43,630
like carry one with me just in

920
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:45,010
case because there's a lot of places

921
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,630
even last week that i've been to

922
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:47,890
that are still like you have to

923
00:31:47,890 --> 00:31:49,060
wear a mastcam i have one in

924
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:50,380
the car usually and i went to

925
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:52,510
an eye doctor appointment and it wasn't

926
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:53,620
on the way i was like let

927
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:54,490
me just make sure i have it

928
00:31:54,490 --> 00:31:55,450
and it wasn't there and i was

929
00:31:55,450 --> 00:31:57,430
so i hadn't even thought about even

930
00:31:57,430 --> 00:31:58,510
wearing a mask wow

931
00:31:58,510 --> 00:32:00,580
oh yeah to it it's it's like

932
00:32:00,610 --> 00:32:03,700
a switch flipped once i got past

933
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:06,040
that second shot yeah and when once

934
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,690
i went into the first restaurant that

935
00:32:08,170 --> 00:32:09,427
didn't make you have a mask it

936
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:10,750
just feels like weird to have one

937
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:12,400
on now so i know but i

938
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,200
also like i mean it's interesting like

939
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:17,080
i have um a cousin who lives

940
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:18,670
in the midwest

941
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:23,230
rest and in ritchie cunningham area milwaukee

942
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:25,900
perhaps rhonda wearing a mask for her

943
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:27,880
comfort but then some people were you

944
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,320
know people tend to be judgment because

945
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:31,390
the town is really republican you know

946
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:34,540
yeah not yeah yeah into it and

947
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:35,950
so then that's like a whole thing

948
00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:37,330
too it's like i just want everyone

949
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:38,830
to do what ever

950
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:40,060
one should be able to do whatever

951
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:41,260
they want to do my mom was

952
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:43,120
telling me that she still wears a

953
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,730
mascot church because you know she's down

954
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:47,620
in orange county and they're singing in

955
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:49,030
it's yeah doesn't want god to be

956
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:49,900
the identifier

957
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,110
why a lot of people there had

958
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:55,540
gotten vaccinated is that i said i

959
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:56,890
would imagine it's a little lower than

960
00:32:56,950 --> 00:32:58,900
law but but she just you know

961
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:01,000
and she's vaccinated and but she just

962
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,730
for safety she wants to to wear

963
00:33:03,730 --> 00:33:05,080
it for right now and she says

964
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:07,060
everyone at church glares at her at

965
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:09,220
church see that's the thing i don't

966
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:10,720
like the judgement around it because i

967
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:11,170
feel like it's

968
00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:13,053
just like if you're gonna it's a

969
00:33:13,053 --> 00:33:14,770
it's a it's a big adjustment after

970
00:33:14,770 --> 00:33:16,270
wearing it every day yeah for every

971
00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:17,770
little thing i'm being nervous about everything

972
00:33:17,770 --> 00:33:19,540
and then just exactly back to everything

973
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:21,280
so not happening it's it's so weird

974
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:24,340
that people take it personally like yeah

975
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:26,380
wow we all know why yeah but

976
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:28,630
it's it's so it's wild it's still

977
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:29,800
so wild to me i can't wrap

978
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,390
my mind around so it signs

979
00:33:31,390 --> 00:33:33,100
yes everything is so nuts but i

980
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:34,810
will say that i like we're flying

981
00:33:34,810 --> 00:33:41,500
soon um for a funeral angeles yeah

982
00:33:41,890 --> 00:33:44,471
and then later um and then later

983
00:33:44,471 --> 00:33:45,791
and in august we're gonna go to

984
00:33:45,791 --> 00:33:47,800
the south carolina oh and you get

985
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:50,080
to go again yeah i'm i'm we're

986
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,550
both so looking forward to

987
00:33:51,550 --> 00:33:53,440
ooh it um but i i don't

988
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,460
think i'll ever get on a plane

989
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:56,950
again without a mask yeah i think

990
00:33:57,010 --> 00:33:58,870
i think that's a good thing like

991
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:00,850
i mean that'll probably just help a

992
00:34:00,850 --> 00:34:02,050
lot of people not get cold just

993
00:34:02,050 --> 00:34:03,430
seems like yeah i mean i feel

994
00:34:03,430 --> 00:34:05,020
like jimmy pardo doesn't he always get

995
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:06,340
sick on a plane anytime he has

996
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:07,900
to travel so like he should just

997
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:10,619
do it straight away he should yeah

998
00:34:10,990 --> 00:34:11,710
because i would like why

999
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:14,260
wipe down my stuff if i had

1000
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:16,150
clorox wipes on me or something like

1001
00:34:16,570 --> 00:34:18,070
kind of before everything like when i'm

1002
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:19,780
flying just like we never do that

1003
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:22,210
every day because it was like oh

1004
00:34:22,390 --> 00:34:23,710
sometimes it would seem really gross and

1005
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:25,240
other times i just wouldn't care but

1006
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:26,560
i do think i would do that

1007
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,720
now and i don't know where mass

1008
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:29,741
do they do they make you wear

1009
00:34:29,741 --> 00:34:31,690
a mask on the plane i don't

1010
00:34:31,690 --> 00:34:31,870
know

1011
00:34:31,943 --> 00:34:33,700
we don't know yeah we were traveling

1012
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:35,860
in in july as well so we'll

1013
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:37,690
see but man i sort of miss

1014
00:34:37,691 --> 00:34:39,130
the days of planes though like i

1015
00:34:39,130 --> 00:34:40,960
remember when i flew back from milwaukee

1016
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:43,720
to to move back to la and

1017
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:45,310
the guide next to me in the

1018
00:34:45,310 --> 00:34:46,780
seat next to me just like pulled

1019
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:48,040
out a flask and was like yo

1020
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:50,770
awesome it was just a fox and

1021
00:34:50,770 --> 00:34:52,030
our normal imo

1022
00:34:52,210 --> 00:34:54,430
those days when you're gonna smoke on

1023
00:34:54,430 --> 00:34:56,860
the plane now i although my first

1024
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:58,600
plane trip i took there was a

1025
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:01,000
whole smoking section it was it's bizarre

1026
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:03,670
it's still fantastic there's a section section

1027
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:05,380
like you can just pull a curtain

1028
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:07,210
yeah okay so i smoked on a

1029
00:35:07,210 --> 00:35:08,980
plane to la nice and it was

1030
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:12,190
after they banned smoking on domestic flight

1031
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:14,170
lights and then after be gone or

1032
00:35:14,290 --> 00:35:16,000
ah yes it was ridiculous it's like

1033
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:17,380
oh wow

1034
00:35:18,095 --> 00:35:19,570
a smoker you must have been like

1035
00:35:19,570 --> 00:35:21,880
thank god oh yeah my real do

1036
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:24,640
indulge my disgusting habit yeah and the

1037
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:25,690
plain stank

1038
00:35:26,830 --> 00:35:29,980
this was great but yet too interestingly

1039
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:31,450
you guys are like fully living your

1040
00:35:31,450 --> 00:35:31,960
life

1041
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:35,170
i mean like mike basically is too

1042
00:35:35,170 --> 00:35:37,180
because he's he's vaccine he's been vaccinated

1043
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:40,750
much longer so like he's been doing

1044
00:35:40,750 --> 00:35:42,610
stuff and it's just so it i

1045
00:35:42,610 --> 00:35:43,690
feel a little bit like a shut

1046
00:35:43,690 --> 00:35:44,770
in a little bit still like i'm

1047
00:35:44,770 --> 00:35:47,050
kind of living i do i honestly

1048
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,610
like it hasn't gone back to normal

1049
00:35:49,210 --> 00:35:50,950
yeah it's it's where we're still at

1050
00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:53,230
home more often than we're not i

1051
00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:56,350
i think because we're only seeing vaccinated

1052
00:35:56,350 --> 00:35:58,150
people and we're we're yeah we're not

1053
00:35:58,150 --> 00:35:59,890
going out to eat all that much

1054
00:35:59,890 --> 00:36:01,120
and we're you know it's just like

1055
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:02,530
baby steps in a way but i

1056
00:36:02,530 --> 00:36:04,000
feel like one when i am with

1057
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,270

probably swimming in the only river

00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,090
like shitting in the middle of the

1078
00:36:46,090 --> 00:36:49,300
street but i will say i was

1079
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:50,890
thinking about this today because i'm listening

1080
00:36:50,890 --> 00:36:54,610
to amanda klute says ah audible book

1081
00:36:54,610 --> 00:36:58,180

00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:02,020
husband nick cordero was oh nice passat

1083
00:37:02,590 --> 00:37:04,120
getting out early enough yeah

1084
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:08,110
just kidding but um it's not a

1085
00:37:08,110 --> 00:37:09,550
shino you're too it's like i know

1086
00:37:09,550 --> 00:37:11,020
that name i've still gonna go for

1087
00:37:11,050 --> 00:37:12,970
it i listened to her audio book

1088
00:37:12,970 --> 00:37:14,740
and it's really good and um i

1089
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:16,120
really i'm really enjoying it but it's

1090
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:17,800
also making me feel like i don't

1091
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,990
regret at all taking everything as seriously

1092
00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:21,430
as i did the whole time and

1093
00:37:21,430 --> 00:37:24,970
yeah absolutely being super obsessive about all

1094
00:37:24,970 --> 00:37:25,150
my

1095
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:27,160
a little habits i yeah i'm totally

1096
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:28,840
happy i was like that and i

1097
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:30,220
i'm sure i'll be able to drop

1098
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:31,840
it all when it's fine but yeah

1099
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:34,240
yeah you just never know i mean

1100
00:37:34,270 --> 00:37:35,620
and and i was kind of like

1101
00:37:35,650 --> 00:37:37,480
when i got the the second vaccine

1102
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:38,590
and everyone was like the second one

1103
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:39,910
is bad and then i had no

1104
00:37:39,910 --> 00:37:41,080
symptoms i was kind of like i

1105
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:42,610
wonder if i wouldn't have had any

1106
00:37:42,610 --> 00:37:45,100
symptoms if i got it but then

1107
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:45,310
i read

1108
00:37:45,310 --> 00:37:46,420
read an article that was like it

1109
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:48,670
did it's not an indication of how

1110
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:50,320
right yeah i would have i was

1111
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,370
worried about that too i was worried

1112
00:37:51,370 --> 00:37:53,320
about cause everyone did kind of relationships

1113
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:54,550
that i just like all the people

1114
00:37:54,550 --> 00:37:57,130
who still have weird smelling problems i

1115
00:37:57,130 --> 00:37:59,140
know that there's so many long-term effects

1116
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:00,370
you could have so it's just like

1117
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:02,650
yeah just feels really lucky to get

1118
00:38:02,650 --> 00:38:04,360
to this point and yeah we were

1119
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:05,440
very fortunate that we were

1120
00:38:05,470 --> 00:38:08,500
able to continue doing the show oh

1121
00:38:08,530 --> 00:38:10,900
you know not only over zoom but

1122
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:13,150
in the backyard yeah it's it's ah

1123
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:14,920
your listener yes we were very lucky

1124
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,210
to have jobs that allowed us to

1125
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:19,180
do that yeah yeah oh yeah i

1126
00:38:19,210 --> 00:38:20,530
that's a big part of janie and

1127
00:38:20,530 --> 00:38:22,120
i were talking about that that's like

1128
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:24,850
we have the the luxury of being

1129
00:38:24,850 --> 00:38:25,480
able to

1130
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:28,270
like be under lockdown and keep it

1131
00:38:28,270 --> 00:38:31,450
really tight and even though we did

1132
00:38:31,450 --> 00:38:33,400
we follow the protocols we still felt

1133
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,470
lucky that we never got coded yeah

1134
00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:36,880
of course i mean i was still

1135
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,200
going to work on good girls for

1136
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:39,370
a lot of it too and like

1137
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,320
it was it felt as safe as

1138
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:43,210
it could because they were testing so

1139
00:38:43,210 --> 00:38:45,100
much and like we got tested twice

1140
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:45,790
a day

1141
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:47,560
and i think hello did a read

1142
00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:50,320
a relatively good job with of the

1143
00:38:50,350 --> 00:38:51,760
you know what i mean like you

1144
00:38:51,790 --> 00:38:53,140
there i mean actually it was still

1145
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:54,400
weird because it's like as the actor

1146
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,540
you have to take your mask off

1147
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:57,580
and everyone everyone else was wearing a

1148
00:38:57,580 --> 00:39:00,010
mask and a shield shield and saying

1149
00:39:00,010 --> 00:39:01,630
because they didn't like you didn't hear

1150
00:39:01,690 --> 00:39:03,520
so you got you heard stories about

1151
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,950
you know production shutting down

1152
00:39:05,950 --> 00:39:07,750
yeah but you didn't hear these stories

1153
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:10,060
about like well you know the star

1154
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:12,430
of clarice is dead today right

1155
00:39:13,330 --> 00:39:15,400
yeah no i know what i'm so

1156
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,680
scary if it like started becoming like

1157
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,270
that where like it was totally out

1158
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:20,740
of control i think there were a

1159
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:22,570
handful of stories i heard about sets

1160
00:39:22,570 --> 00:39:24,040
where it was spreading or something or

1161
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:25,300
this was like the risk and it

1162
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:28,120
was kind of scary um but the

1163
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:29,740
show i was on i'm like grateful

1164
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:31,720
it was really safe and that's another

1165
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:32,620
thing i mean i'm just so happy

1166
00:39:32,650 --> 00:39:33,310
like my work

1167
00:39:33,310 --> 00:39:35,800
work like i didn't socialize basically at

1168
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:38,320
all being because i wanted to be

1169
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:39,460
able to go to work not risk

1170
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:41,830
getting sick and ruining that for myself

1171
00:39:41,830 --> 00:39:43,990

1206
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:00,190

episode where ah neelix the weirdo no

1208
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:08,512
um he's a weird alien ah but

1209
00:41:08,512 --> 00:41:10,090
i don't like about him more than

1210
00:41:10,090 --> 00:41:11,500
him being a weird alien is just

1211
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:12,130
how jealousy

1212
00:41:12,130 --> 00:41:13,330

00:41:13,330 --> 00:41:15,400
on sitcom dads in the nineties he's

1214
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:17,620

great today is that a new shade

1238
00:42:02,470 --> 00:42:05,560
of lipstick and it seemed weird to

1239
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:06,910
me and she says no it's the

1240
00:42:06,910 --> 00:42:08,320
same when i always wear and it

1241
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:10,000
seemed weird to me that in the

1242
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,610
caterpillar torturing universe in they are eqn

1243
00:42:12,610 --> 00:42:16,060
knowledges thing that the with the women

1244
00:42:16,090 --> 00:42:19,240
who work on this fucking starship are

1245
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:21,700
put a lamb themselves yeah yeah in

1246
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:24,280
the twenty fourth century like yeah because

1247
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:26,050
you know easy especially the cat is

1248
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:28,390
zoom yeah so it's weird to break

1249
00:42:28,390 --> 00:42:30,520
the fourth wall as the character and

1250
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:32,080
talk about how you got ready today

1251
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:32,770
yeah but i

1252
00:42:32,778 --> 00:42:36,100
also think like that in that in

1253
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:37,480
the future that you would have like

1254
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:39,162
tattooed makeup and they wouldn't be like

1255
00:42:39,310 --> 00:42:41,530
or whatever now look like that but

1256
00:42:41,530 --> 00:42:43,120
here's the thing nobody you but like

1257
00:42:43,150 --> 00:42:44,470
i like you know i wouldn't pick

1258
00:42:44,470 --> 00:42:45,850
she'd be a space shipping like i

1259
00:42:45,850 --> 00:42:47,050
just got this from so for yeah

1260
00:42:47,050 --> 00:42:48,910
i think you'd have like the holographic

1261
00:42:48,910 --> 00:42:52,090
makeup yeah like basically a facebook filter

1262
00:42:52,090 --> 00:42:52,930
for your actual face

1263
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:55,870
nobody is really just nobody like on

1264
00:42:55,870 --> 00:42:57,460
the crew is really made to look

1265
00:42:57,460 --> 00:42:59,050
like they're wearing makeup you know what

1266
00:42:59,050 --> 00:43:00,850
i mean they're wearing like tv makeup

1267
00:43:01,090 --> 00:43:02,440
they're not wearing like going out to

1268
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:04,660
the discotheque makeup right yeah you know

1269
00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:06,400
so it's sort of worth commenting on

1270
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,110
it it isn't natural yes that's really

1271
00:43:08,110 --> 00:43:09,640
my cup so where you don't notice

1272
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:11,530
it yeah i'm not saying a little

1273
00:43:11,530 --> 00:43:12,790
grass like this

1274
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:14,890
hey just like a woman would notice

1275
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:16,510
did you find her attractive paul

1276
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:19,360
i know someone would notice of another

1277
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:20,530
woman had lipstick gun even if it

1278
00:43:20,530 --> 00:43:21,640
was supposed to look really naturally a

1279
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:22,930
guy might not really pay attention to

1280
00:43:22,930 --> 00:43:25,510
it but in this in the context

1281
00:43:25,510 --> 00:43:26,680
of the show it's really weird that

1282
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:28,030
you're going to comment on the tv

1283
00:43:28,030 --> 00:43:30,460

00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:16,330
stunned that she won this car and

1389
00:47:16,330 --> 00:47:18,580
she started thinking about the the stuff

1390
00:47:18,580 --> 00:47:20,320
that she had to is now i

1391
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:22,840
gotta contact the dealership and yeah it's

1392
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:24,130
still at the end of the process

1393
00:47:24,130 --> 00:47:26,560
it's like ten grand at least yeah

1394
00:47:26,590 --> 00:47:28,210
i mean she was she was

1395
00:47:28,300 --> 00:47:30,520
eventually happy about it but their reaction

1396
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:33,100
in the moment was was hilarious wait

1397
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:34,893
what's ten grand like if you five

1398
00:47:34,893 --> 00:47:36,487
it by the time so you contacted

1399
00:47:36,487 --> 00:47:38,530
dealership and they and you say you

1400
00:47:38,530 --> 00:47:39,790
don't want the car and then they

1401
00:47:39,790 --> 00:47:42,370
give you like what you know after

1402
00:47:42,730 --> 00:47:45,430
that they'll say okay well we'll we'll

1403
00:47:45,430 --> 00:47:47,050
give you this amount of money for

1404
00:47:47,050 --> 00:47:48,160
it which is less than what it's

1405
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:48,370
worth

1406
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:49,810
and then you have to pay taxes

1407
00:47:49,810 --> 00:47:51,490
on top of that so it's like

1408
00:47:51,490 --> 00:47:52,420
at the end of the process you

1409
00:47:52,420 --> 00:47:54,400
take the car no matter what and

1410
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:55,660
