was really funny it was great i

188
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:43,230
haven't seen it but you know what

189
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:45,930
i saw ah murder mystery the movie

190
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:48,180
with j yeah imagine that i fuck

191
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:49,350
i can't believe how much i left

192
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,000
you know it's insane so it really

193
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,260
caught me but i was watching it

194
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:53,820
when i was visiting my family recently

195
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:55,800
and my brother was like oh that

196
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,600
murder mystery movie it's like choose your

197
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,040
own adventure and you always

198
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,110
is it like the baylor study said

199
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:02,850
that he just assumed do it well

200
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,380
he got mixed up somehow because he

201
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:05,820
thinks all movies are choose your own

202
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,766
adventure he's controlling the belief it has

203
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:10,290
dreams like he's a wire yeah well

204
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:11,760
he said that he's like i think

205
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,630
it is and he's like well no

206
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:13,560
i don't know i think it is

207
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:14,580
and then we were watching it and

208
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:17,518
i was like nothing's happening and it's

209
00:07:17,518 --> 00:07:19,050
like so disappointing because the whole time

210
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:19,200
i was

211
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:20,220
thinking i'm going to eventually get to

212
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:23,370
like choose yeah a thing i liked

213
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:24,630
it though i didn't see that beyonce

214
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:26,760
twitter thread yeah i got inspired but

215
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:29,160
only if the fired you know the

216
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,080
beyonce three oh okay so it's this

217
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,580

this or that and don't get fired

220
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:37,650
so like if you choose the wrong

221
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:38,580
thing it leads you to it it's

222
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:39,360
like basically one of those

223
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:40,950
like quizzes where you follow a map

224
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:42,060
you know right but i didn't i

225
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:43,350

they would just delete all of it

276
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:21,150
over i honestly wish the entire internet

277
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:23,010
sometimes would be deleted because i see

278
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:26,100

00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:33,240
theorist here oh but i just this

282
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:33,540
i

283
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,520
just like you know when you look

284
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:38,850
at how weirdly um outright like a

285
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:40,590
lot of video game people are and

286
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:41,910
it's just like like want everyone to

287
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:43,830
just start over and go like like

288
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:46,350
i like things you know the star

289
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:49,320
wars fans are crazy now and the

290
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,030
video game fans are crazy now and

291
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:52,860
everyone is crazy like i i think

292
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:53,760
i'm always crazy

293
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,410
but now they can talk no i

294
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:57,060
don't think we were crazy like i

295
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:59,490
think i also think that it's never

296
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:00,720
had my outlet it's not so much

297
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,340
that there are certain people that really

298
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:04,800
are unstable right but i think that

299
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,600
it's just easy to do it's easy

300
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,310
to get outraged about stuff and it's

301
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:09,810
easy to judge it's easy to get

302
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:11,280
matter about a thing that you know

303
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:12,930
when we were mad about something we

304
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:13,920
would never go like

305
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,035
so listen to me other than like

306
00:10:16,035 --> 00:10:17,865
a friend oh no no no you

307
00:10:17,865 --> 00:10:19,365
certainly wouldn't talk to someone the way

308
00:10:19,365 --> 00:10:21,045
people talk to each other sometimes i

309
00:10:21,045 --> 00:10:22,815
will look at you know ryan johnson

310
00:10:22,845 --> 00:10:24,795
the star wars director so sometimes i

311
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,775
look at his replies and i cannot

312
00:10:26,895 --> 00:10:29,295
fathom being a person who waits around

313
00:10:29,325 --> 00:10:31,785
eagerly for him to tweet anything so

314
00:10:31,785 --> 00:10:32,865
i can call him a piece of

315
00:10:32,865 --> 00:10:34,725
shit yes it's like that's there

316
00:10:34,785 --> 00:10:36,795
lives yes so lame and it's just

317
00:10:36,795 --> 00:10:38,265
such a waste of everything it'd be

318
00:10:38,265 --> 00:10:39,705
very cool if there was a period

319
00:10:39,705 --> 00:10:40,845
of time i think we're like some

320
00:10:40,845 --> 00:10:42,885
news outlet deleted comments from the thing

321
00:10:42,885 --> 00:10:44,415
like maybe the new york times writing

322
00:10:44,715 --> 00:10:46,785
i think everything should everything should be

323
00:10:46,815 --> 00:10:48,525
everybody should be comment doesn't help yes

324
00:10:48,525 --> 00:10:49,815
yeah why do i need to read

325
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:51,465
an article that someone researched and then

326
00:10:51,465 --> 00:10:52,935
read what some dumb ass thinks about

327
00:10:52,935 --> 00:10:54,405
yeah i don't want to know it's

328
00:10:54,405 --> 00:10:54,945
also the same

329
00:10:54,945 --> 00:10:56,415
same fights over and over and over

330
00:10:56,415 --> 00:10:58,785
again well don't even get me mommy

331
00:10:58,815 --> 00:11:01,695
daddy oh don't even give a sorgi

332
00:11:01,845 --> 00:11:05,205
any story on it sorted i had

333
00:11:05,205 --> 00:11:06,585
it with and this and this is

334
00:11:06,585 --> 00:11:09,075
my i will take some culpability in

335
00:11:09,075 --> 00:11:10,635
this because i made a comment about

336
00:11:10,635 --> 00:11:13,005
louis c k and then man i

337
00:11:13,009 --> 00:11:15,105
got so many people that are

338
00:11:15,105 --> 00:11:17,205
are searching his name and trying either

339
00:11:17,205 --> 00:11:18,375
searching or it gets where he gets

340
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:20,385
we get there whatever you know but

341
00:11:20,385 --> 00:11:23,055
it's people that what's so crazy to

342
00:11:23,055 --> 00:11:25,095
me is it's a guy who admitted

343
00:11:25,095 --> 00:11:27,527
he did this horrible stuff and then

344
00:11:27,527 --> 00:11:29,033
he and then he went away and

345
00:11:29,033 --> 00:11:30,105
then he's like i'm just gonna come

346
00:11:30,105 --> 00:11:32,055
back now and it's like all i'm

347
00:11:32,055 --> 00:11:33,765
doing is making a joke about him

348
00:11:33,765 --> 00:11:35,235
being a creep and people

349
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:36,465
like but now it's like people are

350
00:11:36,465 --> 00:11:40,035
like fuck yeah he got consent or

351
00:11:40,035 --> 00:11:41,115
i've even seen people use the word

352
00:11:41,115 --> 00:11:43,395
allegations and it's like he said it

353
00:11:43,395 --> 00:11:46,605
happened it's not an allegation like stare

354
00:11:46,605 --> 00:11:48,345
is like what do you care no

355
00:11:48,345 --> 00:11:49,725
you won't you like him he's doing

356
00:11:49,725 --> 00:11:51,315
great but you should be happy i

357
00:11:51,315 --> 00:11:52,575
think it's interesting you were getting that

358
00:11:52,575 --> 00:11:54,615
too because i i've seen a few

359
00:11:54,615 --> 00:11:55,365
female comedians

360
00:11:55,425 --> 00:11:57,915
reading about him getting like such hateful

361
00:11:57,915 --> 00:11:59,475
responses back i'm just a little bit

362
00:11:59,475 --> 00:12:00,945
glad that it's going both ways oh

363
00:12:00,945 --> 00:12:02,655
yeah oh but i believe me but

364
00:12:02,655 --> 00:12:03,855
it's so nuts to see no one

365
00:12:03,855 --> 00:12:06,375
certainly rag me but yeah yeah but

366
00:12:06,465 --> 00:12:08,625
did it happen i think there is

367
00:12:09,315 --> 00:12:10,755
no look i'm not i'm not counting

368
00:12:10,785 --> 00:12:13,605
now i will say that there's a

369
00:12:13,665 --> 00:12:15,585
there is good with the inner

383
00:12:39,885 --> 00:12:41,625
this before i deleted all my twitter

384
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:43,635
posts but i was just like i

385
00:12:43,635 --> 00:12:46,485
am now only going to write positive

386
00:12:46,485 --> 00:12:48,165
things on the internet like i was

387
00:12:48,165 --> 00:12:50,895
just like what who cares about first

388
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:52,365
of all every single person wants to

389
00:12:52,365 --> 00:12:54,615
be snarky the snarky ist and the

390
00:12:54,735 --> 00:12:55,785
the most clever

391
00:12:55,905 --> 00:12:58,335
and the you know and no matter

392
00:12:58,335 --> 00:13:01,425
what their scalability or skill level at

393
00:13:01,425 --> 00:13:02,625
it you know like like you look

394
00:13:02,625 --> 00:13:04,035
at everyone saying sir this is an

395
00:13:04,035 --> 00:13:05,622
arby's like they're the first person to

396
00:13:05,622 --> 00:13:07,185
ever make that joke or whatever but

397
00:13:07,215 --> 00:13:08,625
everyone wants to be the funniest so

398
00:13:08,625 --> 00:13:10,215
i was just like who gives a

399
00:13:10,215 --> 00:13:11,355
shit if i don't like a tv

400
00:13:11,355 --> 00:13:12,225
show and i want to make a

401
00:13:12,225 --> 00:13:13,364
crack about it i'm just going to

402
00:13:13,364 --> 00:13:15,945
put positive things out there on the

403
00:13:15,945 --> 00:13:16,065
inch

404
00:13:16,065 --> 00:13:17,955
fernet and so and then i deleted

405
00:13:17,955 --> 00:13:19,755
all my twitter posts but yes like

406
00:13:19,815 --> 00:13:21,465
i was saying my we're all just

407
00:13:21,465 --> 00:13:23,775
trash but also i was thinking i

408
00:13:23,805 --> 00:13:25,455
one thing i do is i mute

409
00:13:25,575 --> 00:13:27,045
your trackers they were just right well

410
00:13:27,045 --> 00:13:28,365
it's like it's it doesn't i don't

411
00:13:28,365 --> 00:13:29,835
need to have a record from two

412
00:13:29,835 --> 00:13:31,425
thousand and eight to now of all

413
00:13:31,425 --> 00:13:33,225
the dumb things i've thought and said

414
00:13:33,405 --> 00:13:35,079
like it's just not necessary and i

415
00:13:35,079 --> 00:13:36,225
don't need someone to go

416
00:13:36,345 --> 00:13:37,785
you know i looked back to them

417
00:13:37,785 --> 00:13:39,525
and there it's not even funny like

418
00:13:39,525 --> 00:13:41,145
they don't even touch me funny i'm

419
00:13:41,175 --> 00:13:42,945
sure it's just like i'm bored i'm

420
00:13:43,185 --> 00:13:45,075
yeah when twitter wasn't like a joke

421
00:13:45,075 --> 00:13:46,575
site yeah right it was just like

422
00:13:46,845 --> 00:13:50,115
hey my a one thousand yeah i'm

423
00:13:50,115 --> 00:13:52,695
bored now yeah yeah but i muted

424
00:13:52,695 --> 00:13:54,645
like a bunch of words a bunch

425
00:13:54,645 --> 00:13:56,385
of like really hateful words yeah

426
00:13:56,385 --> 00:13:58,335
yes so that i never see any

427
00:13:58,335 --> 00:14:00,825
tweet that's at me or anyone with

428
00:14:00,825 --> 00:14:03,345
like the word comment or like you

429
00:14:03,345 --> 00:14:05,655
know just that's a hateful word well

430
00:14:05,685 --> 00:14:07,485
no why do you worship it

431
00:14:09,765 --> 00:14:10,875
but like i just feel like it

432
00:14:10,905 --> 00:14:12,285
weeds out probably a lot of negative

433
00:14:12,285 --> 00:14:13,515
things that could be seen and i

434
00:14:13,545 --> 00:14:15,495
could probably add like twenty more words

435
00:14:15,495 --> 00:14:17,175
that and have a better time yeah

436
00:14:17,385 --> 00:14:19,485
oh yeah it's great i just can't

437
00:14:19,485 --> 00:14:21,825
fathom like treating people the way people

438
00:14:21,825 --> 00:14:24,585
treat each other it's just i feel

439
00:14:24,585 --> 00:14:26,265
like i have fallen prey to it

440
00:14:26,265 --> 00:14:28,785
of making snarky comments about things

441
00:14:28,785 --> 00:14:31,185
yz or expressing myself in that way

442
00:14:31,335 --> 00:14:33,705
are also professional comedians yeah but you

443
00:14:33,705 --> 00:14:35,325
have loved to do it but i

444
00:14:35,325 --> 00:14:38,265
am i found myself being susceptible to

445
00:14:38,295 --> 00:14:41,205
that sort of twitter attitude you know

446
00:14:41,205 --> 00:14:43,065
what i mean and i've stopped myself

447
00:14:43,065 --> 00:14:45,225
so many times like in the midst

448
00:14:45,225 --> 00:14:46,935
of composing some dumb joke i'm like

449
00:14:47,025 --> 00:14:48,701
right who needs this i don't think

450
00:14:48,705 --> 00:14:48,885
that

451
00:14:48,945 --> 00:14:50,625
used to be fun to like live

452
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:52,395
tweet the oscars or whatever back when

453
00:14:52,395 --> 00:14:54,045
it was only like five thousand people

454
00:14:54,045 --> 00:14:55,695
or whatever looking at what you said

455
00:14:56,235 --> 00:14:57,435
and it was fine and those people

456
00:14:57,435 --> 00:14:59,175
are like stop you're flooding my feeds

457
00:14:59,205 --> 00:15:01,125
right yeah yeah but now it's like

458
00:15:02,175 --> 00:15:04,875
now why be another person who's trying

459
00:15:04,875 --> 00:15:07,185
to be funnier than whatever people were

460
00:15:07,206 --> 00:15:08,295
trying ads

461
00:15:08,865 --> 00:15:10,665
i think we've passed the point where

462
00:15:10,665 --> 00:15:12,225
being funny on twitter like leads to

463
00:15:12,225 --> 00:15:13,935
something i think there like a few

464
00:15:13,935 --> 00:15:16,155
years ago people were getting jobs from

465
00:15:16,155 --> 00:15:17,865
that i don't really feel like that's

466
00:15:17,865 --> 00:15:19,095
still as much of a thing where

467
00:15:19,095 --> 00:15:21,015
they're like finding new writers know or

468
00:15:21,015 --> 00:15:23,685
twitter figures only rob delaney shelby farrell

469
00:15:23,685 --> 00:15:25,275
and maybe oh show me yeah they're

470
00:15:25,305 --> 00:15:27,075
like people who like king and queen

471
00:15:27,075 --> 00:15:28,665
yeah a few people like popped it

472
00:15:29,055 --> 00:15:30,645
huh yeah sure but that was still

473
00:15:30,645 --> 00:15:32,565
like five years yeah exactly that was

474
00:15:32,565 --> 00:15:33,825
a time where like people were kind

475
00:15:33,825 --> 00:15:35,895
of being plugged for that and now

476
00:15:35,895 --> 00:15:37,485
it's such a like hey i do

477
00:15:37,485 --> 00:15:40,245
like i like the i honestly haven't

478
00:15:40,245 --> 00:15:41,175
gotten to the point where i turn

479
00:15:41,175 --> 00:15:43,035
off comments on instagram yet like you

480
00:15:43,035 --> 00:15:45,525
have paul but i i um i

481
00:15:45,525 --> 00:15:47,955
still like posting something funny and seeing

482
00:15:47,955 --> 00:15:49,185
people like go haha

483
00:15:49,215 --> 00:15:50,955
that was funny or like yeah good

484
00:15:50,955 --> 00:15:52,965
to see you on here whatever it's

485
00:15:52,965 --> 00:15:54,375
just everything that comes with it is

486
00:15:54,375 --> 00:15:57,885
so yeah i honestly i i'm so

487
00:15:57,885 --> 00:15:59,685
happy that i turned off those comments

488
00:15:59,715 --> 00:16:01,365
yeah let's talk about that talk about

489
00:16:01,365 --> 00:16:04,185
because now it's commonly if anybody comments

490
00:16:04,275 --> 00:16:06,615
it's pulse com it's talk about it's

491
00:16:06,645 --> 00:16:08,325
people paul's comments talk about

492
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:13,605
i was trying to find talk about

493
00:16:13,635 --> 00:16:15,195
pop music and i finally found a

494
00:16:15,225 --> 00:16:17,055
talk about his comments it's like it's

495
00:16:17,055 --> 00:16:18,555
the mixture of commons that i get

496
00:16:18,555 --> 00:16:20,445
now from people that i either know

497
00:16:20,445 --> 00:16:22,245
really well or just kind of know

498
00:16:22,245 --> 00:16:24,615
from work or whatever are a mixture

499
00:16:24,615 --> 00:16:28,365
of people saying nice sincere things or

500
00:16:28,545 --> 00:16:29,475
a funny thing

501
00:16:29,685 --> 00:16:31,545
that you know like either they they

502
00:16:31,845 --> 00:16:33,405
what a funny thing that the picture

503
00:16:33,405 --> 00:16:34,935
made them think of right or if

504
00:16:34,935 --> 00:16:36,285
they add on a joke to it

505
00:16:36,315 --> 00:16:39,045
it's funny you know right and it's

506
00:16:39,508 --> 00:16:41,745
it's fewer comments it's like it's less

507
00:16:41,745 --> 00:16:44,115
noise and it's really enjoyable and that's

508
00:16:44,145 --> 00:16:45,315
why that's why i'm saying twitter which

509
00:16:45,345 --> 00:16:47,325
should be is like the only people

510
00:16:47,325 --> 00:16:48,675
who can comment to your the people

511
00:16:48,675 --> 00:16:49,425
that you follow

512
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:51,195
then how fun would it be yeah

513
00:16:51,225 --> 00:16:52,455
well that's what i that's what i

514
00:16:52,455 --> 00:16:54,465
have done is on twitter that they

515
00:16:54,465 --> 00:16:55,485
can come but i don't see it

516
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:58,665

00:18:12,765 --> 00:18:14,145
if you haven't heard this episode they

554
00:18:14,175 --> 00:18:15,765
they each have a timer on their

555
00:18:15,765 --> 00:18:16,905
phone of how they can only use

556
00:18:16,905 --> 00:18:18,345
the internet for an hour in order

557
00:18:18,345 --> 00:18:20,415
to keep each other better and instagram

558
00:18:20,415 --> 00:18:22,095
and we keep each other's passwords but

559
00:18:22,095 --> 00:18:23,775
we both gave each other the password

560
00:18:23,775 --> 00:18:27,195
eventually and and now i just bypass

561
00:18:27,195 --> 00:18:28,245
it all day long and i told

562
00:18:28,245 --> 00:18:29,895
him last night you have to reset

563
00:18:29,895 --> 00:18:31,600

00:18:31,635 --> 00:18:32,865
out of capacity yeah

565
00:18:32,865 --> 00:18:34,815
yeah and it makes me feel nauseous

566
00:18:34,845 --> 00:18:35,715

567
00:18:35,715 --> 00:18:36,765

i'm like this isn't healthy at all

570
00:18:41,445 --> 00:18:42,615
and it's not even i can point

571
00:18:42,615 --> 00:18:43,755
to what i'm looking at that's making

572
00:18:43,755 --> 00:18:45,075

i heard from your social media so

655
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:20,730
this is your fault that i know

656
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:22,980
is that someone ate some of your

657
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:24,480
dessert but i bet you did not

658
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,730
say how the conversation started okay

659
00:21:26,730 --> 00:21:28,140
hey so i was i was seated

660
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:30,300
at the bar um at the restaurant

661
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:32,910
and i was between two men

662
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:35,820
not ideal though their chair that was

663
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:37,830
available drums on it so i've heard

664
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:39,450
the two men there before you said

665
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:42,030
yeah and they're not together and i

666
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:43,830
sat between us so you thought

667
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:48,120
and the one to my left was

668
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,830
with another guy and then i was

669
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:51,480
like ordering food and he kept leaning

670
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,500
over and being like what did you

671
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:53,610
get you know that kind of thing

672
00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:55,260
like hey did you get a sense

673
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:56,340
that he and the other guy were

674
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:57,750
together or did you get a sense

675
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,670
that he was chatting you up it

676
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:02,400
it it didn't it didn't strike me

677
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:03,570
either way it just seemed like he

678
00:22:03,570 --> 00:22:05,130
was definitely wanting to talk

679
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:06,090
talk to me i don't know that

680
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:07,320
he was hitting on me i have

681
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,450
a bad sense for that too i've

682
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:11,010
been hitting hitting on you for like

683
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:13,620
thirty pm so it's okay i think

684
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:17,820
when i started this podcast so you

685
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:19,170

695
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,780

way that women talk about crying in

1213

1246
00:40:20,179 --> 00:40:22,076
crying out of sadness or frustrating yeah

1247
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:24,270
crying out of sadness or frustration as

1248
00:40:24,570 --> 00:40:27,090
my head one once yes every cup

1249
00:40:27,150 --> 00:40:28,830
i had one recently and that and

1250
00:40:28,830 --> 00:40:30,120
i was like oh my god this

1251
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:32,353
has gotten serious like as i it's

1252
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:35,190
it's hardly in terms of like you

1253
00:40:35,190 --> 00:40:36,600
know just personal life or whatever it

1254
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:37,740
hardly ever gets to that point with

1255
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:38,790
me but i was just like ooh

1256
00:40:38,790 --> 00:40:40,380
boy i feel bad about this one

1257
00:40:40,410 --> 00:40:43,110
yeah yeah yeah yeah well it's good

1258
00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:44,704
to cry i mean i do it

1259
00:40:44,730 --> 00:40:46,020
it's interesting though i like no one's

1260
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:47,280
ever articulated like that about like

1261
00:40:47,905 --> 00:40:50,095
like not cry as often typically as

1262
00:40:50,095 --> 00:40:51,805
women that like you might feel better

1263
00:40:52,255 --> 00:40:55,825
like using your like communication to get

1264
00:40:55,825 --> 00:40:57,625
out your feelings that might be give

1265
00:40:57,625 --> 00:41:00,325
the release that the emotionalism wrong would

1266
00:41:00,325 --> 00:41:01,795
give a woman i here's what i

1267
00:41:01,795 --> 00:41:03,835
think is that and this is just

1268
00:41:03,835 --> 00:41:05,365
off the top of my head that

1269
00:41:05,395 --> 00:41:07,465
i think that because when because

1270
00:41:08,065 --> 00:41:10,765
men are allowed to express themselves more

1271
00:41:10,765 --> 00:41:13,825
freely in various ways and they're allowed

1272
00:41:13,825 --> 00:41:16,065
to have negative emotions that but some

1273
00:41:16,375 --> 00:41:17,905
that men are not allowed to express

1274
00:41:17,905 --> 00:41:19,555
themselves in certain way well but they're

1275
00:41:19,555 --> 00:41:21,055
allowed to express things they're allowed to

1276
00:41:21,055 --> 00:41:23,725
express things like if you're angry if

1277
00:41:23,725 --> 00:41:25,555
you're frustrated or whatever and women who

1278
00:41:25,585 --> 00:41:26,935
dug out a bark well look bigger

1279
00:41:26,935 --> 00:41:27,955
look up bark

1280
00:41:28,765 --> 00:41:31,885
litterbug women ah they are not encouraged

1281
00:41:33,265 --> 00:41:35,365
i don't get to girl um they're

1282
00:41:35,365 --> 00:41:38,665
not encouraged to to indulge those emotions

1283
00:41:38,665 --> 00:41:41,095
yeah and i think that it's the

1284
00:41:41,095 --> 00:41:42,115
only thing i can relate to as

1285
00:41:42,115 --> 00:41:43,495
being when i was a kid as

1286
00:41:43,495 --> 00:41:46,105
a middle child i was frustrated all

1287
00:41:46,105 --> 00:41:48,115
the time that i felt like this

1288
00:41:48,115 --> 00:41:48,355
person

1289
00:41:48,355 --> 00:41:49,855
is being listened to this person's being

1290
00:41:49,855 --> 00:41:51,328
listened to i'm not being listened to

1291
00:41:51,328 --> 00:41:53,365
or i'm not being taken seriously and

1292
00:41:53,406 --> 00:41:56,095
drove me fucking crazy because you feel

1293
00:41:56,095 --> 00:41:57,835
like i got i have no one

1294
00:41:57,835 --> 00:42:00,505
in this world that will hear me

1295
00:42:00,505 --> 00:42:02,095
and see me as as a person

1296
00:42:02,365 --> 00:42:04,435
you know and so that's i remember

1297
00:42:04,435 --> 00:42:06,175
crying a lot as a kid out

1298
00:42:06,175 --> 00:42:08,515
of sheer frustration like you're new

1299
00:42:08,515 --> 00:42:10,379
not listening to me right this is

1300
00:42:10,379 --> 00:42:11,695
the this is what happened to me

1301
00:42:11,815 --> 00:42:13,465
this is the way it is whatever

1302
00:42:13,825 --> 00:42:15,205
you know it's a lot of if

1303
00:42:15,205 --> 00:42:16,405
you're met with i don't care who

1304
00:42:16,405 --> 00:42:18,295
started it and it's like it's really

1305
00:42:18,295 --> 00:42:19,585
important that you know who started hitting

1306
00:42:19,585 --> 00:42:21,055
yeah like that's a big part of

1307
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:22,915
what's happening right now yeah you know

1308
00:42:22,945 --> 00:42:24,565
and your experience as a kid is

1309
00:42:24,565 --> 00:42:26,425
like if he's always loved to start

1310
00:42:26,425 --> 00:42:27,595
it but never gets in trouble than

1311
00:42:27,595 --> 00:42:28,585
what is the yeah

1312
00:42:28,675 --> 00:42:31,406
exactly yeah when you're a parent i

1313
00:42:31,406 --> 00:42:33,565
wonder and all the way when you're

1314
00:42:33,565 --> 00:42:35,695
a parent you're a parent although away

1315
00:42:35,725 --> 00:42:38,095
from your first cigarette to your last

1316
00:42:38,095 --> 00:42:40,135
die much jumping around the room i

1317
00:42:40,135 --> 00:42:42,625
truly wonder snapping

1318
00:42:43,867 --> 00:42:46,795
little take delivery that you do they're

1319
00:42:46,795 --> 00:42:49,975
both jumping around the room i wonder

1320
00:42:49,975 --> 00:42:53,095
if because i wonder if if when

1321
00:42:53,095 --> 00:42:55,435
you become a parent you will start

1322
00:42:55,435 --> 00:42:56,665
to just go like i don't care

1323
00:42:56,695 --> 00:42:58,555
who started or whether it will be

1324
00:42:58,555 --> 00:43:00,265
important because that was what was important

1325
00:43:00,265 --> 00:43:01,585
when i was a kid well i

1326
00:43:01,585 --> 00:43:03,955
think i think nowadays mm

1327
00:43:03,955 --> 00:43:06,715
more people are focused on really listening

1328
00:43:06,715 --> 00:43:08,035
to kids like i think across the

1329
00:43:08,065 --> 00:43:09,205
board like of course there are always

1330
00:43:09,205 --> 00:43:10,765
parents like that who are paying attention

1331
00:43:10,765 --> 00:43:12,655
in that way but like it feels

1332
00:43:12,655 --> 00:43:15,445
more um appreciated on the internet at

1333
00:43:15,445 --> 00:43:18,055
least for you to be like well

1334
00:43:18,055 --> 00:43:19,405
what happened and how do you feel

1335
00:43:19,405 --> 00:43:21,355
about yeah we also interesting is is

1336
00:43:21,355 --> 00:43:23,605
because the the arguments that my brother

1337
00:43:23,605 --> 00:43:24,085
and i were in

1338
00:43:24,115 --> 00:43:25,435
as a kid it was always like

1339
00:43:25,435 --> 00:43:27,805
well he started it but i bet

1340
00:43:27,805 --> 00:43:29,275
there actually is a start to it

1341
00:43:29,275 --> 00:43:30,685
before that like if you dig even

1342
00:43:30,685 --> 00:43:32,635
deeper you can go well yeah but

1343
00:43:32,635 --> 00:43:35,665
the reason that the person that everyone

1344
00:43:35,665 --> 00:43:37,765
agrees started it did it is because

1345
00:43:37,765 --> 00:43:39,625
you actually started it with like some

1346
00:43:39,625 --> 00:43:41,275
sort of passive aggressive thing or something

1347
00:43:41,305 --> 00:43:42,385
i don't know any yeah i mean

1348
00:43:42,385 --> 00:43:43,795
but that's good to figure out if

1349
00:43:43,795 --> 00:43:44,215
you actually

1350
00:43:44,275 --> 00:43:45,985
like want to like i don't know

1351
00:43:45,985 --> 00:43:49,135
help your kids right rooney was ugly

1352
00:43:49,315 --> 00:43:51,235
i think if you're gonna make passive

1353
00:43:51,235 --> 00:43:53,515
aggressive comments and you're gonna react violently

1354
00:43:53,725 --> 00:43:56,335
you can't coexist it is funny that

1355
00:43:56,335 --> 00:43:57,385
people of

1356
00:43:58,465 --> 00:44:02,635
certain like modern generations that had old

1357
00:44:02,635 --> 00:44:04,675
school parents are now so afraid of

1358
00:44:04,675 --> 00:44:06,715
being those guys they're gonna do it

1359
00:44:06,715 --> 00:44:07,825
that's why it's not like i don't

1360
00:44:07,825 --> 00:44:09,295
fucking blame them but like the pendulum

1361
00:44:09,295 --> 00:44:10,555
swinging so hard yeah like i don't

1362
00:44:10,555 --> 00:44:11,695
wanna be like my mom yay yeah

1363
00:44:11,725 --> 00:44:13,915
i was like every other generation is

1364
00:44:13,915 --> 00:44:15,415
like that you're never gonna escape it

1365
00:44:15,415 --> 00:44:17,905
though like i feel like i understand

1366
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:18,595
the desire

1367
00:44:18,595 --> 00:44:20,455
fire to say i'm not going to

1368
00:44:20,485 --> 00:44:22,165
scar my kids i'm not gonna have

1369
00:44:22,195 --> 00:44:23,425
i'm not gonna give them a reason

1370
00:44:23,455 --> 00:44:25,465
to resent me it's like what's gonna

1371
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:27,145
yeah they'll find a way yeah i

1372
00:44:27,145 --> 00:44:28,525
think if i were a parent of

1373
00:44:28,525 --> 00:44:30,265
two kids like lifelines away your friends

1374
00:44:30,296 --> 00:44:32,845
think yes drezner as my friend i

1375
00:44:32,845 --> 00:44:35,335
would further the family the movie i

1376
00:44:35,335 --> 00:44:36,535
would maybe like

1377
00:44:37,585 --> 00:44:39,385
make my kids if they were arguing

1378
00:44:39,385 --> 00:44:40,675
a lot i would force them to

1379
00:44:40,675 --> 00:44:42,330
have a rule of like anytime you

1380
00:44:42,330 --> 00:44:43,555
get into an argument and make me

1381
00:44:43,555 --> 00:44:45,505
mediate we're going to end it with

1382
00:44:45,505 --> 00:44:47,245
you guys having to do a full-on

1383
00:44:47,245 --> 00:44:49,915
like lip kiss for sixty seconds after

1384
00:44:49,915 --> 00:44:51,295

1385
00:44:52,675 --> 00:44:54,295
that is still but you know you're

1386
00:44:54,295 --> 00:44:55,645

1387
00:44:55,645 --> 00:44:58,555
other how to lip can go nowhere

1388
00:44:58,705 --> 00:45:01,375
for sixty seconds because living i've ever

1389
00:45:01,375 --> 00:45:02,965
know it's not because you won't be

1390
00:45:02,965 --> 00:45:04,585

those kids would be gone yeah you're

1396
00:45:15,595 --> 00:45:17,605
anytime we fight and they would stop

1397
00:45:17,605 --> 00:45:18,895
fighting because they would know that they

1398
00:45:18,895 --> 00:45:20,245
have to hug each other and have

1399
00:45:20,245 --> 00:45:20,635

1502
00:49:06,805 --> 00:49:09,115
in that neither one of us went

1503
00:49:09,115 --> 00:49:12,745
through a like a ah ah change

1504
00:49:12,745 --> 00:49:14,155
of hardware it's like this is suddenly

1505
00:49:14,155 --> 00:49:16,195
very we need to do that and

1506
00:49:16,195 --> 00:49:17,335
the other person didn't want to do

1507
00:49:17,335 --> 00:49:18,265
it you know which would have been

1508
00:49:18,265 --> 00:49:19,735
right open heart i know that's really

1509
00:49:19,735 --> 00:49:21,325
hard really hard for people when they're

1510
00:49:21,475 --> 00:49:23,185
just suddenly like hey by the way

1511
00:49:23,185 --> 00:49:24,205
i remember that thing we were on

1512
00:49:24,205 --> 00:49:26,095
the same page about yeah that's huge

1513
00:49:26,095 --> 00:49:27,985
and yeah changing yeah but it's like

1514
00:49:27,985 --> 00:49:32,125
we've love kids and i it it's

1515
00:49:32,125 --> 00:49:33,535
just a tradeoff it's like life is

1516
00:49:33,535 --> 00:49:35,965
a series of trade-offs and and you

1517
00:49:35,965 --> 00:49:38,065
know there's certain things that by not

1518
00:49:38,065 --> 00:49:40,015
having kids we get to live a

1519
00:49:40,015 --> 00:49:41,305
certain way that we

1520
00:49:41,935 --> 00:49:43,225
really love and it's not just all

1521
00:49:43,225 --> 00:49:45,535
about like being able to leave somewhere

1522
00:49:45,535 --> 00:49:47,035
at a moment's notice it's also about

1523
00:49:47,035 --> 00:49:48,355
our lives at home and what that's

1524
00:49:48,355 --> 00:49:51,355
like and you know i think that

1525
00:49:52,015 --> 00:49:54,025
if we had kids i think we

1526
00:49:54,025 --> 00:49:56,275
would do an okay job i don't

1527
00:49:56,275 --> 00:49:57,775
know i think she would be better

1528
00:49:57,775 --> 00:49:59,185
than i would be right and i

1529
00:49:59,185 --> 00:50:00,715
know i feel like i yeah i

1530
00:50:00,715 --> 00:50:01,795
really owe for she would

1531
00:50:01,825 --> 00:50:03,055
do better than yeah you want to

1532
00:50:03,055 --> 00:50:06,055
present she'd that's not any better than

1533
00:50:06,055 --> 00:50:09,235
jail huh that's probably true just probably

1534
00:50:09,265 --> 00:50:11,575
drew um but yeah i was a

1535
00:50:11,575 --> 00:50:14,005
star when i think of myself when

1536
00:50:14,005 --> 00:50:15,595
i think of myself as ah as

1537
00:50:15,595 --> 00:50:17,695
a as a parent to a child

1538
00:50:17,725 --> 00:50:21,955
it really i get so anxious um

1539
00:50:22,075 --> 00:50:23,785
about how i would be and and

1540
00:50:23,785 --> 00:50:26,455
how ah i just feel like i

1541
00:50:26,455 --> 00:50:28,885
would let that kid down you know

1542
00:50:29,155 --> 00:50:30,745
that's i don't know i sort of

1543
00:50:30,745 --> 00:50:34,135
i worry that i'm because i like

1544
00:50:34,135 --> 00:50:35,515
just kind of being by myself you

1545
00:50:35,515 --> 00:50:36,955
know i worry that i'm gonna be

1546
00:50:37,135 --> 00:50:39,385
like this where you got married like

1547
00:50:39,595 --> 00:50:40,705

1548
00:50:40,735 --> 00:50:42,085
but i but i worry learn

1549
00:50:42,175 --> 00:50:44,035

that you would be very interested in

1557
00:50:57,865 --> 00:51:01,135
your child's life yeah maybe yeah i

1558
00:51:01,135 --> 00:51:02,275

yeah you'd be surprised how interesting or

1560
00:51:05,275 --> 00:51:06,655
that you know what maybe it's like

once they would be like a certain

1562
00:51:08,125 --> 00:51:10,135
age you see them as they almost

1563
00:51:10,135 --> 00:51:11,815

1565
00:51:14,335 --> 00:51:15,865

1971
01:06:07,745 --> 01:06:09,305
and you take the car into the

1972
01:06:09,425 --> 01:06:10,115
to the place

1973
01:06:12,245 --> 01:06:13,745
