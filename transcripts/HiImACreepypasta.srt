155
00:05:45,708 --> 00:05:47,760
talk about the upfield one twice seventy

156
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,290

229
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,390
clause in it and i remember a

230
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:11,520
friend of mine um one

231
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,130

232
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:15,750
hundred and fifty thousand dollars or something

233
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:17,730
like that and he was just praying

234
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:18,750
it got on the air and that

235
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:19,950
they didn't cancel the games it was

236
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:21,750
one of those nighttime game show easy

237
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:23,760
he was like god because they don't

238
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,677

239
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,600

shows in general to not air a

241
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:31,170

00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:31,590
show

243
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,920

244
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:37,320
to like save money essentially like well

245
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,460
if we got cancelled we're not going

246
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:39,810

447
00:15:30,455 --> 00:15:32,705

449
00:15:35,135 --> 00:15:37,145

451
00:15:39,485 --> 00:15:41,135

452
00:15:41,195 --> 00:15:43,775
yea okay but um that there were

453
00:15:43,775 --> 00:15:46,055
cabins everywhere except for when

454
00:15:46,085 --> 00:15:48,485
you were caught what ages was it

455
00:15:49,415 --> 00:15:50,795
oh it was it was first through

456
00:15:50,795 --> 00:15:52,175
fifth grade or sixth grade

457
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:54,635
slipped out in the ground no in

458
00:15:54,635 --> 00:15:57,215
tps in what they called indian village

459
00:15:57,275 --> 00:15:58,745
oh and the place is still around

460
00:15:58,745 --> 00:15:59,915
i wonder if you can still do

461
00:15:59,915 --> 00:16:01,445
that or is it like goodfellow said

462
00:16:01,445 --> 00:16:04,355
cultural appropriation i don't think it's called

463
00:16:05,525 --> 00:16:07,025
tps in the indian what did you

464
00:16:07,055 --> 00:16:08,795
call it what it was called indian

465
00:16:08,795 --> 00:16:10,865
village you can still call things teepees

466
00:16:10,955 --> 00:16:13,055
okay but because what i'm saying if

467
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,405
they have a daughter or your tv

468
00:16:14,435 --> 00:16:16,835
but they have teepees and nobody involved

469
00:16:16,835 --> 00:16:18,995
is an indigenous person doesn't that seem

470
00:16:19,325 --> 00:16:21,755
appropriate like that is appropriation yes okay

471
00:16:22,025 --> 00:16:23,165

527
00:18:07,565 --> 00:18:10,145

cooperation a

532
00:18:21,815 --> 00:18:22,775

536
00:18:29,915 --> 00:18:32,375
camp i went to was called st

537
00:18:32,375 --> 00:18:34,775
john neumann but i don't remember there

538
00:18:34,775 --> 00:18:37,595
being any religious aspect to it like

539
00:18:37,595 --> 00:18:39,095
i don't think we i don't think

540
00:18:39,095 --> 00:18:40,415
there's any church service i don't think

541
00:18:40,415 --> 00:18:41,885
there was like grace before meals or

542
00:18:41,885 --> 00:18:44,135
anything it was just a ne

543
00:18:44,135 --> 00:18:45,815
a yeah there was nothing religious with

544
00:18:45,815 --> 00:18:48,095
show look the what activities but i'm

545
00:18:48,095 --> 00:18:49,685
just wondering if the whole place was

546
00:18:49,685 --> 00:18:51,185
religious or not but what was that

547
00:18:51,185 --> 00:18:53,615
what was that fascination with why so

548
00:18:53,615 --> 00:18:56,465
many religious places had like oh let's

549
00:18:56,465 --> 00:18:58,623
make it indian themed native american i

550
00:18:58,625 --> 00:19:00,155
didn't feel like we made a number

551
00:19:00,155 --> 00:19:01,625
of chirps or things i think it

552
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:03,935
was exciting thing yeah yeah yeah like

553
00:19:03,935 --> 00:19:04,295
romance

554
00:19:04,295 --> 00:19:07,265
fantasizing the outdoors yeah but they could've

555
00:19:07,265 --> 00:19:09,335

was doing a big purge and i

680
00:23:31,130 --> 00:23:32,480
was getting rid of a lot of

681
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,870
um like things that we had for

682
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:38,630

00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:40,280

someone gave it to me i'm like

686
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:44,870
okay i was going to put outside

687
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:46,520
my neighbor has a baby so they

688
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,540
were like oh great they were taking

689
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:48,140
like a

690
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:49,100
a bunch of the stuff that we

691
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:51,080
were parting with that we didn't think

692
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,640
we didn't worry me as well but

693
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:54,410
yeah but you don't need all my

694
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,900
trash whether we like your note this

695
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:57,980
is an easy way by the way

696
00:23:57,980 --> 00:23:59,120
we're just getting rid of a lot

697
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:02,030
of the zero through six oh yeah

698
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:03,614
there are three to six months oh

699
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:04,970
i see it happened so fast yeah

700
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:06,290
well so it was great because i

701
00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:07,938
was like i was holding on to

702
00:24:07,938 --> 00:24:08,270
so many

703
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:10,250
things thinking maybe i'll want it later

704
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:11,900
and then just i finally admitted about

705
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:12,740
a lot of these things i don't

706
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:13,550
want it but then it was great

707
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:15,140
because my neighbor was like oh we

708
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:16,190
could use all this stuff so it

709
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:17,900
was like it felt very purposeful like

710
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:18,710
i was agreed i don't need to

711
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:19,580
have it anymore and you can use

712
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:20,300
it right now and then do whatever

713
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:21,740
you want that's my point is we

714
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:23,990
should only make one of every thing

715
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,180
everything yeah we all just really like

716
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:28,430

1136
00:38:33,925 --> 00:38:35,125
who want to be number well i

1137
00:38:35,125 --> 00:38:36,595
think they should and want to be

1138
00:38:36,625 --> 00:38:38,575
number one but number one would be

1139
00:38:38,875 --> 00:38:42,775
june casey up diana not diane that's

1140
00:38:42,775 --> 00:38:44,935
june um jessica figure it out on

1141
00:38:44,935 --> 00:38:46,405
friends i wonder maybe it's just alphabetical

1142
00:38:46,405 --> 00:38:48,385
order that's what we have to do

1143
00:38:48,385 --> 00:38:50,395
probably can't all be number one so

1144
00:38:50,455 --> 00:38:52,105
like i bet courtney cox's number one

1145
00:38:53,545 --> 00:38:56,545

1146
00:38:56,545 --> 00:38:58,705
fame who do you think would be

1147
00:38:58,705 --> 00:39:00,415

1148
00:39:00,415 --> 00:39:02,815
group pod or call sheet anything like

1149
00:39:02,845 --> 00:39:04,525
i'm probably gonna go with june because

1150
00:39:04,525 --> 00:39:05,449
i feel like she would make she's

1151
00:39:05,449 --> 00:39:06,685
the one who wants it the yeah

1152
00:39:06,685 --> 00:39:07,945

for

1156
00:39:13,315 --> 00:39:14,245
or that then you think it should

1157
00:39:14,245 --> 00:39:15,685
be alphabetical from that point forward i

1158
00:39:15,685 --> 00:39:17,425
mean i'm like we got casey we

1159
00:39:17,425 --> 00:39:19,285

1160
00:39:19,285 --> 00:39:21,235

we have elizabeth lane we have danielle

1162
00:39:23,605 --> 00:39:24,985
you can set them to be supporting

1163
00:39:24,985 --> 00:39:26,605
characters no i just mean they're not

1164
00:39:26,695 --> 00:39:28,435
i would say yeah if we're going

1165
00:39:28,435 --> 00:39:30,325
for who's getting those top spots they're

1166
00:39:30,325 --> 00:39:33,041
gonna say they're getting those tops weird

1167
00:39:34,195 --> 00:39:35,785
do they talk about us like this

1168
00:39:35,935 --> 00:39:37,555
no yeah personally they don't they don't

1169
00:39:37,555 --> 00:39:38,785
care about us at all and that's

1170
00:39:38,785 --> 00:39:40,765
the whole point o madman gif of

1171
00:39:40,765 --> 00:39:42,025
course i don't think about you at

1172
00:39:42,025 --> 00:39:44,275

around yeah send it to them see

1176
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:49,765
how they react i think it's a

1177
00:39:49,765 --> 00:39:51,235
great idea to make call sheets for

1178
00:39:51,295 --> 00:39:52,645
every friend group you can think of

1179
00:39:52,675 --> 00:39:53,635

invite pitch to be there called they

1181
00:39:55,045 --> 00:39:55,945
should have a call sheet for all

1182
00:39:55,945 --> 00:39:58,285
of their events and then they tell

1192
00:40:18,085 --> 00:40:19,885

00:41:10,115 --> 00:41:12,095
people not giving us any clues but

1222
00:41:12,335 --> 00:41:14,435
honestly that's how it is i think

1223
00:41:14,585 --> 00:41:16,565
across the board there's no one explaining

1224
00:41:16,565 --> 00:41:17,795
anything and you just you have to

1225
00:41:17,795 --> 00:41:19,235

1226
00:41:19,235 --> 00:41:21,035

00:41:21,035 --> 00:41:25,925
is life yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

1228
00:41:26,045 --> 00:41:27,095

1229
00:41:27,125 --> 00:41:28,625
um tell us i drove past a

1230
00:41:28,637 --> 00:41:29,525
jack in the box and i was

1231
00:41:29,525 --> 00:41:30,275
thinking about how you were

1232
00:41:30,305 --> 00:41:32,525
talking about jack-in-the-box and that fry situation

1233
00:41:32,615 --> 00:41:33,755
that was carl's junior but thank you

1234
00:41:33,755 --> 00:41:35,195
so much for thinking of me oh

1235
00:41:35,195 --> 00:41:37,445
damn i appreciate that i mean writes

1236
00:41:37,446 --> 00:41:39,425
it all memorized because it's gonna sound

1237
00:41:39,485 --> 00:41:41,195
just like my brain is even more

1238
00:41:41,195 --> 00:41:42,935
just centered on myself because i was

1239
00:41:42,935 --> 00:41:44,465
thinking about how i forgot that i

1240
00:41:44,465 --> 00:41:46,175
was in a jack-in-the-box commercial and i

1241
00:41:46,175 --> 00:41:47,256
was thinking why didn't i ever think

1242
00:41:47,256 --> 00:41:48,455
of that thing that was because you

1243
00:41:48,455 --> 00:41:50,135
were saying carl's jr the entire year

1244
00:41:50,465 --> 00:41:51,485
yeah what did you did you play

1245
00:41:51,485 --> 00:41:54,425
jack no i didn't i was um

1246
00:41:54,425 --> 00:41:56,825
the premise of international check the premise

1247
00:41:56,825 --> 00:41:59,027
of the commercial i didn't check em

1248
00:41:59,254 --> 00:42:01,625
you directed the commercial well he did

1249
00:42:02,075 --> 00:42:03,695
oh because the the guy with the

1250
00:42:03,695 --> 00:42:05,495
voice yeah right to all the commercials

1251
00:42:05,495 --> 00:42:07,505
that's what a sweet remember and kindler

1252
00:42:07,505 --> 00:42:09,515
talking about that that guy casting himself

1253
00:42:09,515 --> 00:42:10,265
and he's like i don't know i

1254
00:42:10,265 --> 00:42:10,595
just keep

1255
00:42:10,685 --> 00:42:13,955
hearing this voice and specific voice is

1256
00:42:13,956 --> 00:42:16,685
it's like someone like gemma yeah oh

1257
00:42:16,685 --> 00:42:18,365
yeah yeah yeah jeopardy produce yeah i

1258
00:42:18,365 --> 00:42:20,825

well the to replace alex trebek of

1260
00:42:23,975 --> 00:42:25,715
the the producer of the show reilly

1261
00:42:25,715 --> 00:42:28,325
cast himself was so crazy yeah that

1262
00:42:28,325 --> 00:42:30,125
was really funny um the premise of

1263
00:42:30,125 --> 00:42:30,755
my commercial

1264
00:42:30,785 --> 00:42:32,795
was that they were finally serving breakfast

1265
00:42:32,795 --> 00:42:35,045
all day and other people where i

1266
00:42:35,045 --> 00:42:35,885
was worse for me

1267
00:42:38,105 --> 00:42:39,935
i was in the drive thru as

1268
00:42:39,935 --> 00:42:41,495
long with many other cars as we

1269
00:42:41,495 --> 00:42:43,655
were experiencing going to our other fast

1270
00:42:43,655 --> 00:42:45,275
food places and finding that they no

1271
00:42:45,275 --> 00:42:47,645
longer serve breakfast so i'm screaming and

1272
00:42:47,645 --> 00:42:49,745
sobbing in my car because they don't

1273
00:42:49,745 --> 00:42:51,935
serve breakfast sh and your lunatic and

1274
00:42:51,935 --> 00:42:53,045
i've been saying and then it was

1275
00:42:53,075 --> 00:42:55,085
opera music playing over us in slow-mo

1276
00:42:55,085 --> 00:42:56,585
we all screamed and cried in the

1277
00:42:56,585 --> 00:42:57,155
cars

1278
00:42:57,575 --> 00:42:58,985
and then they're like don't worry we

1279
00:42:58,985 --> 00:43:00,875

stage while performing ham how you go

1424
00:48:34,505 --> 00:48:38,315
about hiding it or how you deal

1425
00:48:38,315 --> 00:48:39,005
with it

1426
00:48:40,715 --> 00:48:42,395
yeah i don't know just curious if

1427
00:48:42,395 --> 00:48:43,385
you guys ever have to deal with

1428
00:48:43,385 --> 00:48:46,055
it like my thank oh baie baie

1429
00:48:46,415 --> 00:48:47,855
thank you so much you know it's

1430
00:48:47,855 --> 00:48:49,325
hard when you're on stage and you

1431
00:48:49,325 --> 00:48:53,345
start getting nervous or so because like

1432
00:48:53,615 --> 00:48:55,895
your your breathing gets really shallow and

1433
00:48:55,895 --> 00:48:58,475
it's very difficult to do the necessary

1434
00:48:58,475 --> 00:49:00,245
thing because you're you're expected to talk

1435
00:49:00,305 --> 00:49:01,685
like i'm talking about when you're doing

1436
00:49:01,685 --> 00:49:04,115
standup yeah if suddenly you start getting

1437
00:49:04,235 --> 00:49:05,825
like a fucking bombing and you start

1438
00:49:05,825 --> 00:49:09,125
getting nervous it's very difficult to keep

1439
00:49:09,125 --> 00:49:11,495
recover because your breathing is getting like

1440
00:49:11,495 --> 00:49:13,385
more shallow and but you have you

1441
00:49:13,385 --> 00:49:15,155
have to be talking yeah at the

1442
00:49:15,155 --> 00:49:17,765
same time so the best thing you

1443
00:49:17,765 --> 00:49:18,875
can do is put yourself in a

1444
00:49:18,875 --> 00:49:19,925
mind state where you don't give a

1445
00:49:19,925 --> 00:49:20,435
shit before

1446
00:49:21,365 --> 00:49:23,255

1448
00:49:25,655 --> 00:49:28,745

00:49:38,705 --> 00:49:41,075
panicky in that way it felt more

1454
00:49:41,075 --> 00:49:43,955
like you just have to keep going

1455
00:49:44,375 --> 00:49:45,935

that it just felt bad it felt

1463
00:50:01,925 --> 00:50:04,055
like scary like oh no this is

1464
00:50:04,175 --> 00:50:06,035
it just felt humiliating yeah like this

1465
00:50:06,035 --> 00:50:07,115
is bad and i have to keep

1466
00:50:07,145 --> 00:50:09,243
an i can't just leave that to

1467
00:50:09,243 --> 00:50:10,805
say it's more just like it feels

1468
00:50:10,805 --> 00:50:13,295
bad but it's not um might your

1469
00:50:13,295 --> 00:50:15,185
brains aware that it's yeah bad you

1470
00:50:15,185 --> 00:50:17,465
just can't stop of course you have

1471
00:50:17,465 --> 00:50:18,875
to keep going of course the famous

1472
00:50:18,875 --> 00:50:18,995
say

1473
00:50:18,995 --> 00:50:19,955
story and you could hear it on

1474
00:50:19,985 --> 00:50:22,355
laboring under delusions of my one of

1475
00:50:22,355 --> 00:50:24,335
my albums um about doing a new

1476
00:50:24,335 --> 00:50:25,985
year's eve show where people threw ice

1477
00:50:25,985 --> 00:50:28,025
at me wow but i still did

1478
00:50:28,025 --> 00:50:30,155
my time wow and then realized later

1479
00:50:30,155 --> 00:50:31,685
i probably could have left and no

1480
00:50:31,685 --> 00:50:34,115
one would have said anything while the

1481
00:50:34,115 --> 00:50:35,435
other part of fun by the way

1482
00:50:35,435 --> 00:50:36,635
that was carried the other part of

1483
00:50:36,635 --> 00:50:37,925
your question was have you ever had

1484
00:50:37,925 --> 00:50:38,885
a panic attack

1485
00:50:39,750 --> 00:50:40,650
and no i don't think i ever

1486
00:50:40,650 --> 00:50:42,960
had i've had one or maybe two

1487
00:50:43,170 --> 00:50:44,610

1488
00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:46,230

1493
00:50:53,910 --> 00:50:56,280

order but we do it it was

1499
00:51:06,870 --> 00:51:08,670
noted i was calling because i got

1500
00:51:08,670 --> 00:51:10,770
into a big argument with my boyfriend

1501
00:51:11,100 --> 00:51:13,170
because i was buying a gift certificate

1502
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:15,960
for someone from a restaurants and he

1503
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:19,500
invited that person along to go get

1504
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:21,960
it what why and he did not

1505
00:51:21,990 --> 00:51:24,150
see the problem in there and see

1506
00:51:24,210 --> 00:51:27,330
arguments wow um sorry i want to

1507
00:51:27,338 --> 00:51:28,318
back i want to be known i

1508
00:51:28,318 --> 00:51:30,870
know you draw i forbid a thing

1509
00:51:31,170 --> 00:51:33,120
to think that if you're getting a

1510
00:51:33,180 --> 00:51:35,160
gift for someone the person that gifted

1511
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:37,590
for moving shouldn't be there during the

1512
00:51:37,590 --> 00:51:40,170
time of the gift getting okay love

1513
00:51:40,170 --> 00:51:42,150
you bye you may yeah he's

1514
00:51:42,150 --> 00:51:44,160
is totally wrong why would you invite

1515
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:46,830
that person it seems weird take him

1516
00:51:46,830 --> 00:51:48,270
watch you buy the thing and then

1517
00:51:48,270 --> 00:51:49,890
you handed to them maybe that's their

1518
00:51:49,890 --> 00:51:51,510
kink where you kink shaming this guy

1519
00:51:51,750 --> 00:51:53,333
i don't i think she probably would

1520
00:51:53,370 --> 00:51:55,020
sad if it was as king he

1521
00:51:55,020 --> 00:51:56,490
wants to watch you buy this

1522
00:51:57,599 --> 00:52:00,060
it's like kuk my guess it does

1523
00:52:00,660 --> 00:52:02,040
but it also is a great tv

1524
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:04,140
show i took my gift i feel

1525
00:52:04,140 --> 00:52:05,550
like as a person who gives the

1526
00:52:05,550 --> 00:52:08,490
gift it does sort of achievements cheapens

1527
00:52:08,490 --> 00:52:10,530
it for them yeah you know it

1528
00:52:10,530 --> 00:52:12,240
doesn't feel special it feels like first

1529
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:13,200
of all that person had to do

1530
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:14,790
the errand of going to the place

1531
00:52:14,820 --> 00:52:16,410
because why not just give me money

1532
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:17,670
yeah we're going here today

1533
00:52:17,670 --> 00:52:18,990
gether yeah why don't you just buy

1534
00:52:18,990 --> 00:52:20,910
it for me here's my question why

1535
00:52:20,910 --> 00:52:22,770
is this a fight like why could

1536
00:52:22,770 --> 00:52:24,360
i think because i can't utilize it

1537
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:25,470
why this is a fight know why

1538
00:52:25,590 --> 00:52:27,960
why if you ask like my why

1539
00:52:27,990 --> 00:52:29,040
do you want to do that and

1540
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:32,670
he can't explain it then you have

1541
00:52:32,820 --> 00:52:34,770
a communication problem or this person cannot

1542
00:52:34,770 --> 00:52:37,320
communicate like if you're like you're saying

1543
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:37,830
what we have here

1544
00:52:37,830 --> 00:52:39,510
there is a failure my question also

1545
00:52:39,540 --> 00:52:40,950
was the three of us did they

1546
00:52:40,950 --> 00:52:43,320
go have food or no they just

1547
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:44,610
went to the restaurant to buy the

1548
00:52:44,610 --> 00:52:45,448
gift card then they were going to

1549
00:52:45,448 --> 00:52:46,890
go do something else together like that's

1550
00:52:46,890 --> 00:52:49,020
that's insane like you can't bring the

1551
00:52:49,020 --> 00:52:50,730
person on the errand of their own

1552
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:53,190
also yeah you can say that's unacceptable

1553
00:52:53,220 --> 00:52:54,870
to me and say like oh no

1554
00:52:54,870 --> 00:52:56,250
i wanted this to be a secret

1555
00:52:56,250 --> 00:52:57,900
so the person can come in the

1556
00:52:57,900 --> 00:52:57,990
ca

1557
00:52:57,990 --> 00:52:59,130
car as long as we keep it

1558
00:52:59,130 --> 00:53:00,990
a secret yeah i'm going to think

1559
00:53:01,050 --> 00:53:02,280
i think great way to avoid a

1560
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:03,780
fight is to say things like that's

1561
00:53:03,810 --> 00:53:06,750
unacceptable to me yeah yeah i know

1562
00:53:06,750 --> 00:53:08,070
but keep it real know but what

1563
00:53:08,070 --> 00:53:09,090
i guess what i'm trying to say

1564
00:53:09,090 --> 00:53:10,380
paul is like don't be afraid to

1565
00:53:10,380 --> 00:53:12,090
say your own feelings about how you

1566
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:13,500
feel about something that i agree with

1567
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:15,390
that and where your boundaries are well

1568
00:53:15,390 --> 00:53:17,640
it sounds like she did not have

1569
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:18,150
an issue with that

1570
00:53:18,150 --> 00:53:20,820
yeah right yeah it's like great yeah

1571
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:23,340
huh anyway drop him well we settled

1572
00:53:23,340 --> 00:53:26,490

jury duty stories go ooh hello

00:54:11,610 --> 00:54:13,890
yeah but i got jury duty when

1594
00:54:13,890 --> 00:54:16,020

00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:23,730
had like my book and my snacks

1599
00:54:24,090 --> 00:54:25,710
and then i filled out some forms

1600
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:27,480
they they didn't they never interviewed me

1601
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:28,260
and then i was sent home and

1602
00:54:28,260 --> 00:54:28,950

i went and i got um excused

1606
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:41,370
because they prefaced it by saying this

1607
00:54:41,370 --> 00:54:43,800
is gonna be a long trial so

1608
00:54:43,830 --> 00:54:45,900
um you gotta get your affairs in

1609
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:48,090
order and it was during pilot season

1610
00:54:48,090 --> 00:54:49,110
this is right out a will

1611
00:54:49,260 --> 00:54:51,090
this was back when i yeah you

1612
00:54:51,090 --> 00:54:52,290
might die here no longer

1613
00:54:55,230 --> 00:54:57,750
your future grandchildren by the way you're

1614
00:54:57,750 --> 00:54:58,680
all going to end up liking each

1615
00:54:58,680 --> 00:55:01,950
other but um and ah it was

1616
00:55:02,010 --> 00:55:03,270
this this was back when i was

1617
00:55:03,270 --> 00:55:05,130
a working actor it was pilot season

1618
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:06,330
and i was like i had to

1619
00:55:06,330 --> 00:55:08,520
write out a letter and say this

1620
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:10,740
is the time of year where i

1621
00:55:10,950 --> 00:55:12,594
try to find work there's also the

1622
00:55:12,594 --> 00:55:13,860
the back of the days when there

1623
00:55:13,860 --> 00:55:14,040
was a

1624
00:55:14,070 --> 00:55:16,950
pilot seats yeah right and um i

1625
00:55:16,950 --> 00:55:18,990
can't i you know if i don't

1626
00:55:18,990 --> 00:55:19,890
get it if i don't get a

1627
00:55:19,890 --> 00:55:22,050
job within this time i probably won't

1628
00:55:22,050 --> 00:55:24,540
get a job right and i was

1629
00:55:24,570 --> 00:55:26,610
mortified i was like this judge is

1630
00:55:26,610 --> 00:55:28,680
gonna yell at me oh yeah you

1631
00:55:28,710 --> 00:55:31,170
think you are better than league judges

1632
00:55:31,170 --> 00:55:32,760
love to yellow and so i had

1633
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:34,230
to wait through uh

1634
00:55:34,260 --> 00:55:38,610
um you know ah selection or something

1635
00:55:38,670 --> 00:55:40,140
i don't know enough through selection but

1636
00:55:40,140 --> 00:55:42,270
there was another address of the judge

1637
00:55:42,270 --> 00:55:45,270
gave to everybody and then afterwards said

1638
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:46,740
ah that i was excused and i

1639
00:55:46,740 --> 00:55:49,560
was so relieved and then the second

1640
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:51,150
time i did it i was chosen

1641
00:55:51,270 --> 00:55:53,550
and i sat on a trial and

1642
00:55:53,790 --> 00:55:54,360

1719
00:58:11,250 --> 00:58:12,240

1720
00:58:12,510 --> 00:58:14,280

it's gonna be like a caricature artist

1841
01:02:05,205 --> 01:02:08,025
on the boardwalk so that so that

1842
01:02:08,025 --> 01:02:09,756
was how we started and then did

1843
01:02:09,756 --> 01:02:11,985
you lose it oh let me get

1844
01:02:11,985 --> 01:02:13,485
to this i like to jump ahead

1845
01:02:14,175 --> 01:02:16,665
so we hear what the

1846
01:02:16,725 --> 01:02:17,895
the trial is going to be about

1847
01:02:17,895 --> 01:02:19,335
the what it's what the type of

1848
01:02:19,335 --> 01:02:22,905
thing it's gonna cover and he starts

1849
01:02:22,935 --> 01:02:27,315
interviewing people ah numerically i was number

1850
01:02:27,315 --> 01:02:29,685
sixty something right he starts with number

1851
01:02:29,685 --> 01:02:31,635
one and he starts just interviewing people

1852
01:02:32,175 --> 01:02:34,815
um saying like here's what the trial

1853
01:02:34,815 --> 01:02:35,865
is going to cover will you have

1854
01:02:35,865 --> 01:02:36,825
a problem being impart

1855
01:02:36,825 --> 01:02:38,685
chel and it was very interesting because

1856
01:02:38,685 --> 01:02:40,935
people immediately like if you they didn't

1857
01:02:40,935 --> 01:02:41,955
want on the jury they would go

1858
01:02:41,955 --> 01:02:43,365
like yeah i would have trouble being

1859
01:02:43,365 --> 01:02:44,895
impartial it was very interesting because the

1860
01:02:44,895 --> 01:02:48,765
judge kept steering them into out of

1861
01:02:48,765 --> 01:02:51,765
politeness they felt like they couldn't because

1862
01:02:51,765 --> 01:02:53,988
he's like no you could be yeah

1863
01:02:54,015 --> 01:02:55,785
he kept steering them into like going

1864
01:02:55,785 --> 01:02:56,985
like yeah you're right i can do

1865
01:02:57,015 --> 01:02:58,545
it i can do yeah and there

1866
01:02:58,545 --> 01:02:59,835
was only one guy who was like

1867
01:02:59,865 --> 01:03:02,505
absolutely not i cannot be impartial and

1868
01:03:02,505 --> 01:03:04,935
he he interviewed him for fifteen minutes

1869
01:03:04,935 --> 01:03:06,495
going but if this happened surely you

1870
01:03:06,495 --> 01:03:08,535
could put aside those things no i

1871
01:03:08,535 --> 01:03:09,915
would never be able to do that

1872
01:03:10,215 --> 01:03:11,925
i cannot be impartial in this story

1873
01:03:12,075 --> 01:03:13,695
and finally after fifteen minutes of just

1874
01:03:13,695 --> 01:03:15,885
excruciating things he goes alright you're free

1875
01:03:15,885 --> 01:03:17,055
to go and i was like damn

1876
01:03:17,182 --> 01:03:20,025
guy actually like withstood fifteen minutes of

1877
01:03:20,235 --> 01:03:23,355
reeling yeah he did it yeah so
