27
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:14,010

163
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:46,980
me to conceive living in another place

164
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:47,970
well a lot of things would have

165
00:05:47,970 --> 00:05:50,430
to happen i mean like to me

166
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:51,600
it's like when i moved from neighborhood

167
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,420
to neighborhood even that i think i

168
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,920
pay the neighborhood now could i go

169
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:58,260
to another place and then once we

170
00:05:58,260 --> 00:05:59,460
moved to the neighborhood we're now we

171
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:02,100
never think about that neighborhood right and

172
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,530
we loved living yeah my old neighborhood

173
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,000
too and i was like i remember

174
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,950
saying to my neighbor like my other

175
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:11,130
naib about my naib i was like

176
00:06:11,573 --> 00:06:13,410
i don't think i would ever want

177
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:14,640
to live anywhere else and

178
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:15,750
he said it's the best place to

179
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,190
live in the world and then suddenly

180
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,620
packed up and just took off that

181
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:21,510
now did or you did well that

182
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:23,610
name eventually did but we were both

183
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:25,380
out of the nabe do you think

184
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:27,750
that that nape left like when i

185
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:29,783
quit a couple the wife dies and

186
00:06:29,783 --> 00:06:30,690
then the man dies of a broken

187
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:32,700

me from what i can tell oh

192
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:41,370
well there were only six of us

193
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,480
and we all had to take turns

194
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:45,000
being the head of the h away

195
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:46,920
association or i guess it's all hey

196
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:51,000
was very annoying it was it's not

197
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:55,260
oh yes e cho da ho but

198
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:57,630
the whoa that's that always seems like

199
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:59,760
such a chore it it was like

200
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,320
when there are rules like when an

201
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,150
apartment building has don't apply to you

202
00:07:03,314 --> 00:07:04,740
but then they're like and you know

203
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:06,690
twenty can have a doggy butter ask

204
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:07,860
us if you can write that kind

205
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,390
of stuff isn't ours wasn't like ours

206
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:10,800
ours was just us trying to get

207
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,240
through it but we all we had

208
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:14,250
to meet get through what just get

209
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:16,950
like like the whole treasury aspect of

210
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:18,810
a yeah like why do they need

211
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:20,730
that but you had to have meetings

212
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:22,890
because like legally you have to and

213
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:24,690
you have to like vote on stuff

214
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:25,650
and you have to you have to

215
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:27,000
say like hey guys we need to

216
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,320
pay for this this it would be

217
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,910
so easy to not like somebody in

218
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:31,290
that situation that i'd go yeah for

219
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:32,340
sure one of one

220
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:34,590
misstep he goes yeah yeah yeah anyway

221
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:36,240
so he didn't he he thought he

222
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,290
thought i was treating it like an

223
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,330
apartment which i probably was of just

224
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:40,560
like you guys do everything and so

225
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,610

that our dog would rip to shreds

689
00:23:49,105 --> 00:23:52,585

00:23:55,525 --> 00:23:56,725
into it but didn't and then it

693
00:23:56,725 --> 00:23:59,275
took weirdly it took the entire time

694
00:23:59,545 --> 00:24:01,435
for the race to be called like

695
00:24:01,465 --> 00:24:03,055

696
00:24:03,055 --> 00:24:03,565
them to

then they found it and they finally

698
00:24:04,975 --> 00:24:06,355
did it yeah well they just wanted

699
00:24:06,355 --> 00:24:07,645
to wait for the results dogs can

700
00:24:07,645 --> 00:24:08,965
smell death and they could smell results

701
00:24:08,995 --> 00:24:10,195
well they want to go hey when

00:24:10,195 --> 00:24:12,385
the networks are gonna call yeah exactly

703
00:24:12,655 --> 00:24:15,205
because at that point they could shoot

704
00:24:15,205 --> 00:24:17,095
up the secret service yeah it doesn't

705
00:24:17,095 --> 00:24:18,895

put you up for nine nights to

719
00:24:46,165 --> 00:24:49,075

723
00:24:54,085 --> 00:24:55,705
really so if you have better insurance

724
00:24:55,705 --> 00:24:56,965

00:24:56,965 --> 00:24:59,275
my insurance was good in that sense

726
00:24:59,275 --> 00:25:00,025

727
00:25:00,025 --> 00:25:01,345

00:25:23,545 --> 00:25:24,955

brides where you carried her over the

744
00:25:31,495 --> 00:25:32,695

790
00:27:16,105 --> 00:27:18,085

00:27:18,085 --> 00:27:20,665
to the other thing of the dull

792
00:27:21,415 --> 00:27:21,685

00:27:33,445 --> 00:27:34,735
but i'm saying by the time i

799
00:27:34,735 --> 00:27:37,195

excited like he's here which means implies

862
00:29:30,055 --> 00:29:31,855
that she's seen the movie and then

863
00:29:31,855 --> 00:29:33,535
he pokes his head out of the

864
00:29:33,535 --> 00:29:35,425
bushes and comes over and kind of

865
00:29:35,425 --> 00:29:35,845

a nice little hug it's like i

868
00:29:39,205 --> 00:29:40,675
guess you are here if you're a

869
00:29:40,675 --> 00:29:42,625
small child and you're watching that movie

870
00:29:42,865 --> 00:29:44,005
he does seem to be the most

871
00:29:44,005 --> 00:29:45,475
pleasant person because he's the only person

872
00:29:45,475 --> 00:29:47,785
not screaming yeah or having sex which

873
00:29:47,785 --> 00:29:50,005
is yellow suit don't understand that he's

874
00:29:50,005 --> 00:29:52,525
there to kill them all yeah yeah

875
00:29:52,555 --> 00:29:54,385
what for these making the screaming stop

876
00:29:54,415 --> 00:29:55,765
so you see this guy's great this

877
00:29:55,765 --> 00:29:55,975
guys

878
00:29:56,215 --> 00:29:56,875
your business

879
00:29:58,045 --> 00:30:00,265
that checks out thank you michael myers

880
00:30:00,295 --> 00:30:03,295
thank god my little anya's no expression

881
00:30:03,295 --> 00:30:04,885
so it's you can assume that he's

882
00:30:04,885 --> 00:30:07,135
doing fine he's neutral yeah yeah neutral

883
00:30:07,255 --> 00:30:08,665
yeah he's not he's at least not

884
00:30:08,665 --> 00:30:11,155
fighting like mom and dad he walks

885
00:30:11,155 --> 00:30:13,975
very slowly not like there's nothing threatening

886
00:30:14,275 --> 00:30:16,405
and you watch halloween kills i know

887
00:30:16,585 --> 00:30:17,665
i did too i thought

888
00:30:19,770 --> 00:30:23,640
oh my own i was a little

889
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:25,530
scared oh really

890
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,400
oh year of the tv i get

891
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,620
scared of scary movies yeah those movies

892
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:33,660
don't scare me that much slasher movies

893
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:36,180
i like that kind of thing more

894
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:38,010
because i like the idea that it's

895
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:41,190
a fake killer who dies thick

896
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:43,800
i know that's a problem for me

897
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,060
yeah but i like when there's like

898
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:46,787
a sort of bow on it and

899
00:30:46,787 --> 00:30:47,910
i don't feel scared i don't like

900
00:30:47,910 --> 00:30:50,340
when it's a ghost or something i

901
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:51,960
always thought it was so i mean

902
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:53,370
the first scream is such a good

903
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:56,010
screenplay right scary movie but it was

904
00:30:56,010 --> 00:30:58,920
so interesting because i never even guessed

905
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:01,620
that it that there there was someone

906
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:02,430
under the mask

907
00:31:02,430 --> 00:31:05,760
sg because freddy and jason and everyone

908
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,500
like they're just these kind of other

909
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,120
worldly killers and so i just thought

910
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,470
they were inventing one of those so

911
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:12,300
when suddenly it was like oh no

912
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:13,514
it's two of these kids i would

913
00:31:13,514 --> 00:31:14,730
i didn't go into that first screen

914
00:31:14,730 --> 00:31:16,320
going like okay who is it which

915
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,510
one of these suspects is the show

916
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:21,180
because you assume it's definitely something outside

917
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:22,560
of their group i yes yes

918
00:31:22,779 --> 00:31:25,260
i don't know if i i

919
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,200
i guess i wasn't sixth grade i

920
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:30,150
probably wasn't thinking anymore but i remember

921
00:31:30,150 --> 00:31:32,100
when i was dating my class i

922
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:34,920
have to report around the class who's

923

everyone in the conversation was therefore example

1252
00:43:29,210 --> 00:43:30,530

1255
00:43:34,310 --> 00:43:36,380
reenactment of that story for about a

1256
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:39,260

minute does that ally remember it we

1259
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:46,790
cut to another enactment of the story

00:43:47,030 --> 00:43:49,730
where that player can occasionally interject corrections

1261
00:43:49,730 --> 00:43:52,100
to the story i e it wasn't

1262
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:52,280
