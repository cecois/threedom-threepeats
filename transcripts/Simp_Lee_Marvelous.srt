the email to someone else and comment

on what the person said i've only

157
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:27,780
done that once and it was to

158
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:30,240
a producer i was working with on

159
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:31,710
a movie that we were trying to

160
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:34,140
get made and um they sent me

161
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:35,760
this the tiniest criticism

162
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:37,980
and i thought i forwarded it and

163
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:39,120
said well i don't know that i

164
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,340
agree with this i instead responded to

165
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:44,070
it oh no and it was it

166
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:46,500
was like the the least dramatic version

167
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,656
of because you're able to go oh

168
00:05:47,656 --> 00:05:48,840
well it's i'm kidding because it was

169
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,400
a very minor note that you gave

170
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,900
yeah well no she she knew that

171
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,280
it was meant to go to someone

172
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,450
else and she's like hey you sent

173
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:55,770
this to me accidentally but nice to

174
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:55,920

175
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:56,907
you don't agree with it and it

176
00:05:56,907 --> 00:05:58,410
was like oh well i don't really

177
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:00,630
but oh yeah that's right it's so

178
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,159

okay brag about what i do oh

232
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,030
i really hate when people talk about

233
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:58,020
what college they went to a lot

234
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:59,580
when they're an adult like who cares

235
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:01,560
yeah it has no bearing as as

236
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,570
a college dropout i could not care

237
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:05,700
less yeah well i mean look this

238
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,680
is because of our industry as well

239
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:11,040
like a lot of probably say it

240
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,600
probably affects

241
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:14,910
other industries of like oh you went

to us yeah to us things definitely

244
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,040
a job where it matters where you

245
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,360
went to school but i still think

246
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:23,490
bragging in sort of because those people

247
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:24,540
who are bragging no one's just saying

248
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:25,890
it about some random school they went

249
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:27,390
to it's always like ah ivy league

261
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,140
and finch pub yeah it happens with

262
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:51,030
a lot of schools and it's really

263
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,091
i mean harvard's a big one though

264
00:08:52,091 --> 00:08:53,190
that you hear a lot i went

265
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:55,050
to school near the marathon bombing

266
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:58,260
not to pry right on top of

267
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:58,380
it

268
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,130
i never understood people's connection to school

269
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:05,370
after school is done yeah until um

270
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,070
i guess it really depends on the

271
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,930
this is an experience i can understand

272
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,940
jamie went to a very small school

273
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:13,170
high school it was

274
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:17,700
there's an all girls school and next

275
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,920
week yeah and it was so sexy

276
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:21,510
i think that would have been so

277
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:22,890
great yeah and it was a small

278
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:25,440
class so she's very she feels very

279
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,140
connected to them still even though they

280
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:30,300
don't they don't like talk all the

281
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:31,800
time or whatever you know it can

282
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,360
be hard to talk all the time

283
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:34,560

00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:52,920
for an adult to be doing that

295
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:55,350

296
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:56,820

00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:37,275
in town and you have talked about

316
00:10:37,275 --> 00:10:40,095
this and and what's stopping you you

317
00:10:40,095 --> 00:10:43,995
interest yeah why are you looking up

318
00:10:43,995 --> 00:10:46,005
the courses to see if there's like

319
00:10:46,005 --> 00:10:46,965
a course that i would like if

320
00:10:46,965 --> 00:10:48,075
there was something that jumped out at

321
00:10:48,075 --> 00:10:49,297
me i would maybe go like oh

322
00:10:49,297 --> 00:10:50,685
i might do that what is it

323
00:10:50,685 --> 00:10:51,585
like once a week i have to

324
00:10:51,585 --> 00:10:52,695
go to these things i have no

325
00:10:52,695 --> 00:10:53,475
fucking i think

326
00:10:53,482 --> 00:10:56,175
generally yeah yeah that sounds fine like

327
00:10:56,175 --> 00:10:58,125
what does line what day every you

328
00:10:58,125 --> 00:10:58,995
know you kind of pick a day

329
00:10:58,995 --> 00:11:00,645
based on what works for you can

330
00:11:00,645 --> 00:11:03,495
i say the idea that doesn't work

331
00:11:03,615 --> 00:11:05,355
the idea doesn't work for me well

332
00:11:05,355 --> 00:11:07,455
then i need structure for some reason

333
00:11:07,455 --> 00:11:09,230
i've gotten into i've gotten to continue

334
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:10,815
like a class that works your schedule

335
00:11:10,965 --> 00:11:12,975
right move boy mccoy

336
00:11:13,635 --> 00:11:14,475
i've gotten to a place in my

337
00:11:14,475 --> 00:11:17,325
life where trying to schedule something on

338
00:11:17,325 --> 00:11:21,885
a weekly basis seems impossible i would

339
00:11:21,885 --> 00:11:23,865
pretty much agree with you on that

340
00:11:23,925 --> 00:11:24,945
like a thing that i want to

341
00:11:24,945 --> 00:11:26,055
do well as opposed to like an

342
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:27,617
obligation like i'm i have a couple

343
00:11:27,617 --> 00:11:29,175
of writing projects and i meet with

344
00:11:29,505 --> 00:11:31,035
each of those people to write once

345
00:11:31,035 --> 00:11:32,775
a week and it's like that is

346
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:33,705
hard to maintain

347
00:11:33,795 --> 00:11:35,535
like it's like it takes a lot

348
00:11:35,535 --> 00:11:38,205
of time energy yeah it isn't it's

349
00:11:38,205 --> 00:11:39,555
good but it's like you have to

350
00:11:39,555 --> 00:11:41,715
really build it into what if it's

351
00:11:41,715 --> 00:11:43,695
at night well i'm doing that tonight

352
00:11:43,695 --> 00:11:45,885
even actually writing at night tonight because

353
00:11:45,885 --> 00:11:47,325
i was like maybe this will ride

354
00:11:47,325 --> 00:11:49,185
at night yeah i'm gonna do it

355
00:11:49,185 --> 00:11:50,565
after he goes to bed that's my

356
00:11:50,565 --> 00:11:53,355
ideas were gonna meet on sit some

357
00:11:53,355 --> 00:11:53,955
possible and

358
00:11:53,955 --> 00:11:55,425
right at seven thirty one of whatever

359
00:11:55,425 --> 00:11:57,015
you write she ends up dreaming about

360
00:11:57,285 --> 00:11:59,145
wow that would be so amazing i

361
00:11:59,145 --> 00:12:03,435
hope not why because it's vulgar oh

362
00:12:03,465 --> 00:12:04,905
you don't want a vulgar child

363
00:12:08,085 --> 00:12:10,905
yeah god hates vulgar truly

364
00:12:12,045 --> 00:12:13,095
one of the one of the things

365
00:12:13,095 --> 00:12:14,805
that god hates them oh okay god

366
00:12:14,805 --> 00:12:17,085
hates he's like number one with a

367
00:12:17,085 --> 00:12:19,063
bullet appeals above himself even though he

368
00:12:19,063 --> 00:12:20,385
used to be best friends they used

369
00:12:20,385 --> 00:12:21,645
to be but it's so if that

370
00:12:21,645 --> 00:12:23,265
happens how it goes yeah that's how

371
00:12:23,265 --> 00:12:24,441
it goes sometimes that's how it goes

think was i feel like it was

500
00:17:04,305 --> 00:17:06,525
an in-person audition because this is before

501
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:08,955
you zarco sen shit in like even

502
00:17:08,955 --> 00:17:10,695
before but even before covert you could

503
00:17:10,695 --> 00:17:11,775
record stuff at home and send it

504
00:17:11,835 --> 00:17:12,822
now when i sort of prefer the

505
00:17:12,822 --> 00:17:14,925
in person of course then it could

506
00:17:14,925 --> 00:17:15,075
delay

507
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:16,425
wrecked you but those days are over

508
00:17:16,485 --> 00:17:19,725

experience i think it would play better

698
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:20,070

action sequences and then turn it off

799
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:45,810
having seen i think the freeway things

00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:48,180

805
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:55,260
yeah in the minority but only

806
00:27:55,410 --> 00:27:57,540
just watched make that movie yeah that

807
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:58,410
should have been a movie and it

808
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:00,120
should be called freeway matrix two it's

809
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,950
twenty minutes long two freeway

810
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:05,190
hey how are people getting into ari

811
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:08,130
guys the matrix it's just called freeway

812
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:11,070
the latest matrix movie included like canon

813
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:14,550
from the video game the matrix like

814
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:16,980
they everything that they did matrix related

815
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:20,130
was considered canon for that universe and

816
00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:21,420
so it was like i had no

817
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:22,860
fucking idea what was going on because

818
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:23,310
i didn't see the

819
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:26,040
third one yeah i liked the idea

820
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,390
of it and i liked the first

821
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:29,940
one was the idea of it that

822
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:31,590
the mate here's what i would have

823
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:33,951
done with it yeah okay so the

824
00:28:34,011 --> 00:28:36,150
the basically keanu because it starts with

825
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:38,640
keanu reeves like in an advertising job

826
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:41,010
or something like that yes and he

827
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:42,240
said he know he's got you know

828
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,500
he's the guy who made the mayor

829
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:46,470
six video game or whatever yeah and

830
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:49,079
i like the idea the idea of

831
00:28:49,079 --> 00:28:51,300
basically the matrix has recaptured him and

832
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:54,570
convinced him that the matrix experience was

833
00:28:54,570 --> 00:28:56,130
all just like something he thought of

834
00:28:56,130 --> 00:28:57,600
as a video game and then he

835
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,590
has to fight his way out of

836
00:28:58,590 --> 00:29:00,120
it but here's the tough time i

837
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:02,040
have with that is that sort of

838
00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:03,660
that's all off

839
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:06,000
scream yeah right know that i prefer

840
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,080
the whole movie be off screen

841
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:09,840
so then it's just like a minute-long

842
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,100
so be saying like here's a crazy

843
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:12,360
thing that you have it yeah and

844
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:13,770
they describe it and then credits

845
00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:17,310
you like that you'd like minute-long movies

846
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:19,290
love a minute long movie as long

847
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:20,280
as it just gets right to the

848
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,600
point and then i would take two

849
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,710
hours of credits and i'll read all

850
00:29:22,710 --> 00:29:25,170

us together like he's like well what

875
00:30:13,826 --> 00:30:15,570

00:30:15,570 --> 00:30:17,400
the sandwiches probably fifth yeah she's twenty

877
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:18,870

00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:21,420
pill blues someone in the chain of

879
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:23,970
command no fucked up and so wild

880
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:25,800
to think how many people are involved

881
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,510
in a project like that and not

882
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:29,580
one of them has either heard or

883
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:30,960
said the current or yeah or the

884
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,130
curves like she sees

885
00:30:32,875 --> 00:30:34,945
yeah but i feel like i'm missing

886
00:30:34,945 --> 00:30:37,075
something here and let me just ok

887
00:30:37,255 --> 00:30:39,895
i feel like to red pill i

888
00:30:39,895 --> 00:30:42,025
feel like i get everything cause someone

889
00:30:42,025 --> 00:30:44,235
to have their perspective dramatically transformed especially

890
00:30:44,245 --> 00:30:45,385
by introducing them to a new and

891
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:47,395
typically disturbing understanding of the true nature

892
00:30:47,395 --> 00:30:50,005
of particular situation that's yes they are

893
00:30:50,035 --> 00:30:51,715
talking about conspiracy theories and claim they

894
00:30:51,715 --> 00:30:53,035
have been red-billed orange

895
00:30:53,065 --> 00:30:55,135
in the nineteen nineties with reference to

896
00:30:55,135 --> 00:30:56,665
a scene in the film the matrix

897
00:30:57,145 --> 00:30:58,525
in which the protagonist is offered the

898
00:30:58,525 --> 00:31:00,415
choice between taking a blue pill in

899
00:31:00,595 --> 00:31:02,455
your stories ordinary what you're not getting

900
00:31:02,455 --> 00:31:04,465
is the specific type of person who

901
00:31:04,705 --> 00:31:06,745
says they've been red pill yes it's

902
00:31:06,745 --> 00:31:09,145
not nobody internet users to fairly describe

903
00:31:09,145 --> 00:31:12,025
their own socio-political few points got it

904
00:31:12,295 --> 00:31:13,195
but the best

905
00:31:13,195 --> 00:31:15,865
first is that i think the earliest

906
00:31:15,865 --> 00:31:17,335
origins of it being used in that

907
00:31:17,335 --> 00:31:19,315
way can be traced to a guy

908
00:31:20,965 --> 00:31:23,905
a guy who was saying he he

909
00:31:23,905 --> 00:31:26,155
was red pills and into understanding that

910
00:31:26,155 --> 00:31:29,155
women control actually are control of everything

911
00:31:29,935 --> 00:31:32,875
and um he realised it because his

912
00:31:34,408 --> 00:31:36,715
something about his mother making him take

913
00:31:36,715 --> 00:31:38,875
diarrhea right

914
00:31:41,125 --> 00:31:42,565
this is so funny to say like

915
00:31:42,745 --> 00:31:44,035
that's how i really like women are

916
00:31:44,035 --> 00:31:45,920
actually in charge of everything and without

917
00:31:45,925 --> 00:31:47,575
turning i would know about as a

918
00:31:47,575 --> 00:31:49,015
woman or what i was that you

919
00:31:49,015 --> 00:31:50,215
didn't mean like how does that yeah

920
00:31:50,245 --> 00:31:52,135
but it's like something like that like

921
00:31:52,135 --> 00:31:54,535
a conspiracy theory like that would you

922

easy to me yeah i don't know

968
00:33:33,825 --> 00:33:35,275
like most of them are like so

969
00:33:35,305 --> 00:33:36,505
so many people would have to be

970
00:33:36,505 --> 00:33:38,335
involved and no one can ever keep

971
00:33:38,335 --> 00:33:40,825
a secret exactly yeah yeah yeah that's

972
00:33:40,825 --> 00:33:41,905
the thing that always trips me up

973
00:33:41,905 --> 00:33:43,315
is like no there's no way that

974
00:33:43,315 --> 00:33:45,775
anybody we would something something

975
00:33:45,835 --> 00:33:48,415

00:38:25,975 --> 00:38:27,295
so if you if you go there

1105
00:38:27,295 --> 00:38:29,365
you're never coming back i swear to

1106
00:38:29,365 --> 00:38:30,445
god i heard that why is it

1107
00:38:30,445 --> 00:38:32,395
taking such a wiser to a wide

1108
00:38:32,395 --> 00:38:34,225
range oh i just seven months i

1109
00:38:34,225 --> 00:38:36,055
guess it's because if you were to

1110
00:38:36,385 --> 00:38:37,645
when they're talking about in terms of

1111
00:38:37,645 --> 00:38:41,694
like colonization or something that goes like

1112
00:38:41,725 --> 00:38:43,555
all the infrastructure and everything and you

1113
00:38:43,555 --> 00:38:45,325
couldn't write yeah you know

1114
00:38:46,225 --> 00:38:49,255
no nine months fuck so long time

1115
00:38:49,375 --> 00:38:51,835
to travel yeah all in all holes

1116
00:38:51,835 --> 00:38:52,825
you want to make it around trip

1117
00:38:52,825 --> 00:38:53,695
all in all it would take about

1118
00:38:53,695 --> 00:38:55,105
twenty one months as you need to

1119
00:38:55,105 --> 00:38:56,635
wait about three months on mars to

1120
00:38:56,635 --> 00:38:57,805
make sure earth and mars are a

1121
00:38:57,805 --> 00:38:59,605
suitable location make the trip back home

1122
00:38:59,635 --> 00:39:02,125
dang yeah that's a good idea i

1123
00:39:02,125 --> 00:39:03,475
don't think anyone should ever go there

1124
00:39:03,955 --> 00:39:05,515
i don't think it's necessary if you

1125
00:39:05,515 --> 00:39:05,725
do

1126
00:39:05,785 --> 00:39:07,015
bring a copy of date night i

1127
00:39:07,015 --> 00:39:09,715
think you should wait to tow until

1128
00:39:09,835 --> 00:39:12,025
we can get there faster just even

1129
00:39:12,025 --> 00:39:14,485
like shh let's shave off two months

1130
00:39:14,725 --> 00:39:16,195
off of that i think it should

1131
00:39:16,195 --> 00:39:17,845
take five months mask max to get

1132
00:39:17,845 --> 00:39:19,585
anywhere yeah think if it takes longer

1133
00:39:19,585 --> 00:39:20,665
than that you shouldn't go if anything

1134
00:39:20,695 --> 00:39:22,705
takes long in the five months out

1135
00:39:22,825 --> 00:39:25,915
it should be like making ah ah

1136
00:39:26,005 --> 00:39:28,135

1137
00:39:28,255 --> 00:39:29,635

1201
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:07,050
three times already i'm a bit surprised

1202
00:42:07,050 --> 00:42:09,600
but i'm also totally on board during

1203
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:12,360
the serial alphabets yeah this still making

1204
00:42:12,390 --> 00:42:15,120
those are really good wow i really

1205
00:42:15,294 --> 00:42:16,410
don't think they did they were just

1206
00:42:16,410 --> 00:42:17,220
a sugary little

1207
00:42:17,250 --> 00:42:18,750
alphabet you know i always like to

1208
00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:20,250
chomp into a different shape and they

1209
00:42:20,250 --> 00:42:21,450
had a lot of different shapes yeah

1210
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:22,860
six to be exact do they do

1211
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:24,570
all twenty six oh yes you could

1212
00:42:24,570 --> 00:42:26,250
spell stuff in your serial do you

1213
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:28,560
know that sometimes i use a commercial

1214
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:31,950
confuse the amount of letters in alphabet

1215
00:42:31,950 --> 00:42:33,090
with the amount of teeth in the

1216
00:42:33,090 --> 00:42:34,380
human how many teeth are because i

1217
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:35,790
never remember that i believe it's thirty

1218
00:42:35,790 --> 00:42:37,077
two that's my guess actually that i

1219
00:42:37,077 --> 00:42:37,320
had my

1220
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:39,750
head and how old was jesus when

1221
00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:42,000
he died thirty three it's because he

1222
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,130
was one to missing and hope they

1223
00:42:44,130 --> 00:42:45,570
used have more teeth back then yeah

1224
00:42:45,630 --> 00:42:47,430
oh and you would live to the

1225
00:42:47,430 --> 00:42:49,080
age of your today he loses tooth

1226
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:50,790
every year on his birthday he loses

1227
00:42:50,790 --> 00:42:51,990
a tooth every year on his birthday

1228
00:42:51,990 --> 00:42:53,610
and so by the end jesus had

1229
00:42:53,610 --> 00:42:56,310
no teeth no teeth wow that's where

1230
00:42:56,310 --> 00:42:56,820

this was submitted by krista and this

1336
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:47,310
is called pitchmen toe pitchmen toe which

1337
00:46:47,310 --> 00:46:49,950
is a portmanteau of pitching and portmanteau

1338
00:46:50,010 --> 00:46:53,850
for belief okay okay so elegant portmanteau

1339
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:57,270
this is a lot like structured like

1340
00:46:57,270 --> 00:46:58,290
switch it and pitch it in a

1341
00:46:58,290 --> 00:46:59,310
way here's what i like about the

1342
00:46:59,310 --> 00:47:01,860
thresher yeah there's five ingredients

1343
00:47:01,890 --> 00:47:04,920
yeah this is like our taco bell

1344
00:47:04,950 --> 00:47:08,100
one six actually one is a portmanteau

1345
00:47:08,550 --> 00:47:10,893
one is switch i don't want it

1346
00:47:10,990 --> 00:47:13,170
one is guessing what is sideways and

1347
00:47:13,170 --> 00:47:15,782
prolong his big ingredient yeah okay but

1348
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:19,350
young is big ingredient so the the

1349
00:47:19,620 --> 00:47:21,390
one person is pitching to two people

1350
00:47:21,390 --> 00:47:22,020
but the

1351
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:23,280
the the way they figure out what

1352
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:26,490
they're going to pitch is ah separately

1353
00:47:26,850 --> 00:47:28,410
the other two people that you're pitching

1354
00:47:28,410 --> 00:47:31,710
to send you one word fuck and

1355
00:47:31,710 --> 00:47:34,110
then you have to okay put the

1356
00:47:34,110 --> 00:47:38,400
two words together seems and pitch that

1357
00:47:38,490 --> 00:47:40,290
ooh so it's not like you're making

1358
00:47:40,290 --> 00:47:41,550
a portmanteau of the two words but

1359
00:47:41,550 --> 00:47:42,180
you're using

1360
00:47:42,210 --> 00:47:44,250
