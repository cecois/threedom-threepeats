but but maybe malicious

333
00:11:55,605 --> 00:11:57,225

00:11:57,255 --> 00:11:59,565

00:13:15,075 --> 00:13:16,845
brandy i was reading i was reading

372
00:13:16,845 --> 00:13:18,945
john hodgkins book and so i put

373
00:13:18,945 --> 00:13:21,675
on my ipod for six hours or

374
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:25,215
whatever and with earbuds and i then

375
00:13:25,215 --> 00:13:27,015
i started having trouble with my ears

376
00:13:27,045 --> 00:13:28,695
whenever i would podcast he would just

377
00:13:28,695 --> 00:13:31,335
get really for weeks hours

378
00:13:31,395 --> 00:13:33,397
yeah out by the pool that's we're

379
00:13:33,397 --> 00:13:34,995
not talking to anyone that's a lot

380
00:13:36,435 --> 00:13:37,804
not really reading the book but just

381
00:13:37,845 --> 00:13:40,125
lost my eyes glazing over reading the

382
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:42,345
same sentence four thousand one hundred and

383
00:13:42,345 --> 00:13:46,065
two comprehending anything um but but yeah

384
00:13:46,065 --> 00:13:48,315
so then i started started reading because

385
00:13:48,315 --> 00:13:49,875
my sound person on the friends movie

386
00:13:49,875 --> 00:13:51,285
gave me some headphones was like oh

387
00:13:51,285 --> 00:13:52,815
this will help because i was wearing

388
00:13:52,845 --> 00:13:54,345
earbuds when i was at the monitors

389
00:13:54,345 --> 00:13:55,695
trying to add this crazy too

390
00:13:56,325 --> 00:13:57,675
and why didn't you put on the

391
00:13:57,675 --> 00:13:59,715
over years that's what he gave me

392
00:13:59,715 --> 00:14:00,495
and he was like he gave me

393
00:14:00,495 --> 00:14:02,175
some special overhears and and then the

394
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:03,615
more i started researching the more i

395
00:14:03,615 --> 00:14:05,655
was like oh shit you're only supposed

396
00:14:05,655 --> 00:14:06,855
to wear like your buds for an

397
00:14:06,885 --> 00:14:09,075
hour like and that's it really or

398
00:14:09,075 --> 00:14:11,667
otherwise damage your hearing anyway so i

399
00:14:11,667 --> 00:14:13,095
would no matter what the volume is

400
00:14:13,305 --> 00:14:15,885

good i will tell you this i

448
00:15:50,385 --> 00:15:53,955
recently saw a video about baseball in

449
00:15:53,955 --> 00:15:56,805
finland whoa and basically

450
00:15:57,285 --> 00:15:59,325
what happened was a guy from finland

451
00:15:59,325 --> 00:16:01,545
went to america no you know in

452
00:16:01,545 --> 00:16:03,285
the in the early nineteen hundreds or

453
00:16:03,285 --> 00:16:05,046
something one guy only one guy went

454
00:16:05,046 --> 00:16:06,705
until they could only marry to fly

455
00:16:06,705 --> 00:16:09,075
son they sent one yeah there's like

456
00:16:09,075 --> 00:16:10,605
go check out americans so just let

457
00:16:10,605 --> 00:16:12,555
us go we came but only one

458
00:16:12,555 --> 00:16:15,765
was stuck there was no internet oh

459
00:16:15,795 --> 00:16:17,415
yeah make for it back

460
00:16:17,475 --> 00:16:19,095
they're like go write down everything you

461
00:16:19,095 --> 00:16:21,825
see and take a picture yeah in

462
00:16:21,825 --> 00:16:23,445
your mind and draw them this guy

463
00:16:23,715 --> 00:16:25,935
saw some baseball games he was fascinated

464
00:16:25,935 --> 00:16:28,455
by wow came back to finland he's

465
00:16:28,455 --> 00:16:30,555
like there's this stick let's start there

466
00:16:30,585 --> 00:16:32,415
honestly it hits so pretty much like

467
00:16:32,415 --> 00:16:34,515
that really he explained it to the

468
00:16:34,515 --> 00:16:37,245
best of his recollection and well that's

469
00:16:37,245 --> 00:16:37,575
a mess

470
00:16:37,635 --> 00:16:40,125
it's something they tried to play it

471
00:16:40,155 --> 00:16:42,164
it's so they still do play it

472
00:16:42,164 --> 00:16:44,085
the same way their version of it

473
00:16:44,115 --> 00:16:46,215
yeah wastefully based on this guy's aussie

474
00:16:46,215 --> 00:16:48,285
matter how to play yes she's a

475
00:16:48,285 --> 00:16:50,205
wonder here's how base baseball's play was

476
00:16:50,295 --> 00:16:51,465
first of all it's all baseball

477
00:16:53,235 --> 00:16:56,175
based on birnbaum plays what are the

478
00:16:56,175 --> 00:16:57,555
main differences like what are the uses

479
00:16:57,555 --> 00:16:58,905
about everything is different they use a

480
00:16:58,905 --> 00:17:00,915
bat but the the bases are like

481
00:17:00,915 --> 00:17:04,785
a zigzag pattern on it's third base

482
00:17:04,785 --> 00:17:05,955
it's a home run if you weren't

483
00:17:05,955 --> 00:17:07,905
paying attention though you wouldn't probably pick

484
00:17:07,905 --> 00:17:08,745
up the fact that they're in a

485
00:17:08,745 --> 00:17:11,295
square now here's diamond if you weren't

486
00:17:11,295 --> 00:17:12,855
paying a time and bar like baseball

487
00:17:12,885 --> 00:17:13,065
thing

488
00:17:14,175 --> 00:17:16,785
baseball famous last eight hours law yeah

489
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:18,435
and there's no way you cannot see

490
00:17:18,435 --> 00:17:19,635
the man he couldn't stay because he

491
00:17:19,635 --> 00:17:20,715
had to go investigate the rest of

492
00:17:20,715 --> 00:17:22,185
america i think he got drunk at

493
00:17:22,185 --> 00:17:22,515
the game

494
00:17:23,685 --> 00:17:26,745
that's doubt but it's it's so so

495
00:17:26,745 --> 00:17:28,545
zigzag pattern if you get to third

496
00:17:28,545 --> 00:17:30,135
you're you when you get a point

497
00:17:30,135 --> 00:17:32,445
there's like a big round plate at

498
00:17:32,445 --> 00:17:35,385
home plate that if a circle yeah

499
00:17:35,655 --> 00:17:37,485
it's but it's like it's raised it's

500
00:17:37,485 --> 00:17:38,805
like a like a trash can lid

501
00:17:38,805 --> 00:17:41,385
turned upside down that seems okay it's

502
00:17:41,385 --> 00:17:43,725
so if you there's something about if

503
00:17:43,725 --> 00:17:43,815
you

504
00:17:43,815 --> 00:17:45,915
you get a ball if you throw

505
00:17:45,915 --> 00:17:47,505
the ball in there like i think

506
00:17:47,505 --> 00:17:49,395
you only get three swings that's it

507
00:17:49,425 --> 00:17:50,775
and if you throw the ball onto

508
00:17:50,775 --> 00:17:52,485
the circle plate it's a strike or

509
00:17:52,485 --> 00:17:54,423
something it's why can't i also need

510
00:17:54,423 --> 00:17:56,445
a video it's wow if you did

511
00:17:56,445 --> 00:17:59,355
describe baseball exactly right it still sounds

512
00:17:59,355 --> 00:18:00,405
like what you just said

513
00:18:01,575 --> 00:18:04,125
that's true like like everyone everyone goes

514
00:18:04,155 --> 00:18:06,792
oh okay yeah right around when it

515
00:18:06,792 --> 00:18:08,445
sings about a land on these little

516
00:18:08,445 --> 00:18:10,665
diamond i disagree first of all the

517
00:18:10,665 --> 00:18:12,675
word diamond i think would be extraordinarily

518
00:18:12,705 --> 00:18:16,035
oh yeah diamond but you're also talking

519
00:18:16,035 --> 00:18:18,375
about clubs like baseball clubs don't land

520
00:18:18,375 --> 00:18:19,815
on these little flight a lot of

521
00:18:19,815 --> 00:18:21,735
heart to play that little things

522
00:18:22,545 --> 00:18:25,063
called soup confusing you know but are

523
00:18:25,063 --> 00:18:27,165
not even flat though they're three-dimensional that's

524
00:18:27,165 --> 00:18:29,205
the home plate is famously shaped like

525
00:18:29,205 --> 00:18:31,575
a little house yeah it is famous

526
00:18:31,575 --> 00:18:33,585
yeah it's famous for being the most

527
00:18:33,585 --> 00:18:34,965
house like shape but wouldn't that be

528
00:18:34,965 --> 00:18:36,075
weird thing if someone came back and

529
00:18:36,075 --> 00:18:37,005
said so then they have they have

530
00:18:37,005 --> 00:18:38,325
a little house at the at the

531
00:18:38,325 --> 00:18:41,115
beginning you started our house and it

532
00:18:41,115 --> 00:18:41,895
but that's home

533
00:18:41,925 --> 00:18:43,095
well you would you would yes you'd

534
00:18:43,095 --> 00:18:45,825
say homie wow yeah yeah hearted maybe

535
00:18:45,825 --> 00:18:47,505
just putting it together that it's showing

536
00:18:47,535 --> 00:18:49,725
nowadays i don't think i ever have

537
00:18:49,725 --> 00:18:52,455
really thought that either i might lie

538
00:18:52,455 --> 00:18:53,325
and say i have but i don't

539
00:18:53,325 --> 00:18:54,855
think i have i am sure that

540
00:18:54,855 --> 00:18:56,985
way yeah i don't know a hundred

541
00:18:56,985 --> 00:18:58,605
percent i bet it is wow

542
00:18:59,265 --> 00:19:01,305
it's fun isn't it isn't the obvious

543
00:19:01,305 --> 00:19:02,805
answer is the right one

544
00:19:05,295 --> 00:19:08,513
it's like oc hams razor em so

545
00:19:08,513 --> 00:19:10,665
what actually you owe me is pronounced

546
00:19:10,665 --> 00:19:13,785
dacha so so why isn't first base

547
00:19:13,785 --> 00:19:15,525
shaped like a one second base shape

548
00:19:15,525 --> 00:19:17,445
like well that would be easier thursday

549
00:19:17,445 --> 00:19:19,395
show three so that way are harder

550
00:19:19,395 --> 00:19:20,955
to get on base i think if

551
00:19:20,955 --> 00:19:22,335
it hadn't been a wrote number one

552
00:19:22,335 --> 00:19:24,135
on it cool just

633
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:01,830
is what makes it too interesting is

634
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:02,790
it's three of the stars from the

635
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:04,320
show because they were a child

636
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,120
the actors on it so they're telling

637
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:07,560
their shedding light on what it was

638
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,810

one part set it up on the

803
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:25,890
beach or set it up outside in

your house we set up in the

805
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:28,800
car where it was

806
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:29,160
awkward

807
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:31,020
we set it up on the beat

808
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:34,440
random there was a rag da

809
00:27:35,910 --> 00:27:37,620
and there was one part that we

810
00:27:37,770 --> 00:27:39,780
we couldn't quite figure out a big

811
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:42,420
part of that part we couldn't quite

812
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:44,430
figure out how it came together and

813
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:45,480
we got it together as best we

814
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,760
could turns out it did not matter

815
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,370
because it was broken oh which we

816
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:52,110
found out later but then also it

817
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:55,680
was so fucking windy that this thing

818
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:58,170
ng almost took off into the sky

819
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,360

824
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:08,640

your is my copy the end the

1194
00:40:17,030 --> 00:40:18,950
best thing to do in this situation

1195
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:20,420
is ignore it and hope that it

1196
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:21,890
never happens again yeah of course right

1197
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,210
and that's what you do so

1198
00:40:23,210 --> 00:40:24,320
so i did that for and then

1199
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,250
a few weeks so you don't think

1200
00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:25,910
you should pick your wife

1201
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:28,190
that's what i did a few weeks

1202
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:30,380
later i come back home there's a

1203
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:32,060
rat again of course and it's campers

1204
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:33,170
away i'm like ok we got to

1205
00:40:33,170 --> 00:40:34,615
figure out this priming and i total

1206
00:40:34,615 --> 00:40:35,570
people up and she's like this is

1207
00:40:35,570 --> 00:40:40,580
your deal exterminator and so i looked

1208
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:42,050
up solutions and i went to home

1209
00:40:42,050 --> 00:40:43,250
depot or whatever and the first thing

1210
00:40:43,250 --> 00:40:44,630
i tried to do is the humane

1211
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:47,090
situation which is like this glue trap

1212
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:47,210
you

1213
00:40:47,905 --> 00:40:50,845
but baits like peanut butter or cheese

1214
00:40:50,965 --> 00:40:52,105
right in the middle of this glue

1215
00:40:52,105 --> 00:40:53,485
thing and then they get stuck in

1216
00:40:53,485 --> 00:40:55,135
it and then there's no more break

1217
00:40:55,135 --> 00:40:57,697
off it's just there's still alive in

1218
00:40:57,697 --> 00:40:58,705
in the morning you let him out

1219
00:40:58,705 --> 00:41:00,775
or whatever i think glue traps and

1220
00:41:00,775 --> 00:41:01,975
you wag your finger at them like

1221
00:41:02,035 --> 00:41:03,685
oh say you think they're bad i

1222
00:41:03,685 --> 00:41:05,995
didn't say something we're just closed behind

1223
00:41:05,995 --> 00:41:08,035
it or something no this is

1224
00:41:08,065 --> 00:41:09,925
like an out it's it's like it's

1225
00:41:09,955 --> 00:41:11,575
literally just like a plate with glue

1226
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:13,582
okay well maybe it's a snap so

1227
00:41:13,582 --> 00:41:15,625
yeah so i put it out and

1228
00:41:15,625 --> 00:41:17,575
i put the i put the superhero

1229
00:41:17,575 --> 00:41:19,735
homewares yeah and

1230
00:41:20,905 --> 00:41:22,945
in the morning go outside the the

1231
00:41:22,975 --> 00:41:24,625
bait is gone there's like little tiny

1232
00:41:24,685 --> 00:41:26,245
feet mark right through it they got

1233
00:41:26,245 --> 00:41:27,355

1290
00:43:30,265 --> 00:43:32,125

eight yrs

1294
00:43:37,315 --> 00:43:38,575
years or so ago there was some

1295
00:43:38,575 --> 00:43:40,555
mosquito e batch of lumber they got

1296
00:43:40,555 --> 00:43:42,595
shipped here and now we have excuses

1297
00:43:42,685 --> 00:43:45,835
but my friends was saying okay well

1298
00:43:45,835 --> 00:43:46,855
you know what i've read about the

1299
00:43:46,855 --> 00:43:48,595
solution of this is you need to

1300
00:43:48,595 --> 00:43:50,935
get a bat house in you know

1301
00:43:51,265 --> 00:43:53,155
yeah so he's like like midler used

1302
00:43:53,155 --> 00:43:55,195
to sing at the bat house it

1303
00:43:55,195 --> 00:43:57,115
was your cat houses ah bath

1304
00:43:57,535 --> 00:44:00,595
oh yeah she's sing in court was

1305
00:44:01,525 --> 00:44:03,235
that the best was my little one

1306
00:44:03,385 --> 00:44:05,154
that was ooh yeah i mean that

1307
00:44:05,154 --> 00:44:06,565
was i mean richard pryor he used

1308
00:44:06,565 --> 00:44:08,365
to perform there that's right so it's

1309
00:44:08,365 --> 00:44:10,735
like this little tiny envelope be looking

1310
00:44:10,735 --> 00:44:11,965
thing that you're supposed to put up

1311
00:44:11,965 --> 00:44:13,735
in your in the crevice of your

1312
00:44:14,365 --> 00:44:15,805
of your house and you sent me

1313
00:44:15,805 --> 00:44:17,635
like all of this but that's enough

1314
00:44:17,635 --> 00:44:19,345
oh but no bats like live in

1315
00:44:19,345 --> 00:44:21,115
them they sleep in them so it's

1316
00:44:21,115 --> 00:44:23,305
outside so it's outside right and then

1317
00:44:23,305 --> 00:44:24,985
he he sent and then the places

1318
00:44:24,985 --> 00:44:27,445
that sell them they say like bats

1319
00:44:27,445 --> 00:44:30,625
can eat up to like one thousand

1320
00:44:30,625 --> 00:44:32,845
bugs an hour or something right and

1321
00:44:32,845 --> 00:44:34,825
so pigs you know what i don't

1322
00:44:34,825 --> 00:44:36,775
want that's around me well that's the

1323
00:44:36,775 --> 00:44:37,765
thing okay so

1324
00:44:37,795 --> 00:44:39,595
then i look up another site and

1325
00:44:39,595 --> 00:44:43,045
it says yeah you could eat like

1326
00:44:44,035 --> 00:44:46,195
five sandwiches an hour but you don't

1327
00:44:46,195 --> 00:44:46,915
you get full

1328
00:44:48,115 --> 00:44:49,795
all of this research is dumb they're

1329
00:44:49,795 --> 00:44:51,745
not like sitting around there like thousand

1330
00:44:51,745 --> 00:44:53,305
bucks two thousand and eight thousand bucks

1331
00:44:53,305 --> 00:44:55,555
four thousand bucks they get full after

1332
00:44:55,555 --> 00:44:57,055
like an hour and so it's it's

1333
00:44:57,055 --> 00:44:58,495
like now you just have bats and

1334
00:44:58,495 --> 00:44:59,935
bugs around here now don't want that

1335
00:45:00,245 --> 00:45:02,035
i remember going to the brookfield zoo

1336
00:45:02,065 --> 00:45:04,255
in chicago which shields has zoo yeah

1337
00:45:04,255 --> 00:45:05,755
well we rarely we rarely went to

1338
00:45:05,755 --> 00:45:07,465
that zoo because lincoln park zoo is

1339
00:45:07,465 --> 00:45:07,885
free

1340
00:45:08,275 --> 00:45:09,715
we go there all the time when

1341
00:45:09,715 --> 00:45:12,385
goodbye so is free but brookfield zoo

1342
00:45:12,415 --> 00:45:14,065
costs money so we went there on

1343
00:45:14,065 --> 00:45:16,675
school field trips everyone's well and we

1344
00:45:16,705 --> 00:45:18,715
um they remember they have this bat

1345
00:45:18,715 --> 00:45:21,115
cave you walk through it it was

1346
00:45:21,115 --> 00:45:22,855
dark and there were giant flying over

1347
00:45:23,275 --> 00:45:25,825
us i remember specifically if i remember

1348
00:45:25,825 --> 00:45:28,405
correctly but i remember this little factoid

1349
00:45:28,435 --> 00:45:30,445
that might maybe be true give us

1350
00:45:30,445 --> 00:45:31,525
a i don't want it to be

1351
00:45:31,525 --> 00:45:33,595
a fact it's a factoid for sure

1352
00:45:33,625 --> 00:45:34,945
make sure it's a factoid before you

1353
00:45:34,945 --> 00:45:38,755
say should avoid it's a toyed toy

1354
00:45:39,168 --> 00:45:41,545
a toy tidy toy to toy it's

1355
00:45:41,545 --> 00:45:43,855
a toy um the fact is that

1356
00:45:43,855 --> 00:45:45,235
if you threw if you were walking

1357
00:45:45,265 --> 00:45:47,785
