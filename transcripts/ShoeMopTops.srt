42
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:53,130
kiddos that was remember tim allen he

43
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:54,870
would make the noise and people thought

44
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:57,900
it was great man was it probably

45
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:02,940
stand-up yeah we're standards lower or where

46
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:04,620
it was or just not only entertainment

47
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:06,990
that anyone could see no one did

48
00:02:07,009 --> 00:02:07,620
noises

49
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,870
before here's what here's what's interesting about

50
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:11,760
that to me now i loved that

51
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,188
show but i was a child now

52
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:16,470
as they were both made for adults

53
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:20,400
i mean when you became billy when

54
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,510
you became a man you put away

55
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:24,360
childish things right oh yeah and rap

56
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,160
i think that for some reason wrap

57
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:27,150
the shrimp

58
00:02:28,518 --> 00:02:30,137
put on your rap rap

59
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:33,690
rep coop so the idea is that

60
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:34,830
day

61
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:38,760
it was made for families and so

62
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,070
it had to be in this middle

63
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:43,560
place where it could appeal to absolutely

64
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:48,330
everybody um without fear of repercussions paul

65
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:49,860

375
00:15:33,195 --> 00:15:34,065
the way that

376
00:15:34,575 --> 00:15:37,935
tacitly is saying that he is bald

377
00:15:37,995 --> 00:15:39,015
and not just that he has a

378
00:15:39,015 --> 00:15:40,965
short haircut i thought they were always

379
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:42,495

380
00:15:42,495 --> 00:15:44,475
haircut he has one hair no i

381
00:15:44,475 --> 00:15:44,835

383
00:15:47,085 --> 00:15:50,685

00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:26,329
house we had to be pumping it

570
00:22:26,329 --> 00:22:28,790
out with these machines and we had

571
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:30,980
to throw out a bunch of clothes

572
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:32,000
that were in the hopefully not those

573
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:34,430
terminator machines boy they're gonna take over

574
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:37,130
the world ah no it wasn't that

575
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:39,380
it was some sort of reverse fan

576
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:41,180
situation but i

577
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:42,650
i am not a terminator

578
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:46,850
the ah frank fell into our window

579
00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:48,860
well and got trapped than the guy

580
00:22:48,895 --> 00:22:50,570
the animal control came and she's like

581
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:53,090
what's my one move this all i

582
00:22:53,090 --> 00:22:54,560
know how to do i can't get

583
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,600
out of here so here goes well

584
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,730
in the animal control guy shot him

585
00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:00,590
and miss now with like a tranquilizer

586
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:02,510

00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,270
i can't remember who it was they

808
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:54,560
came up with like the perfect punchline

809
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:56,210
that wrapped up the whole like the

810
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:58,070
the perfect button on the whole thing

811
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:00,830
everyone was laughing and i have this

812
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:03,080
weird thought of my head and i

813
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:04,370
knew what i was doing

814
00:31:05,810 --> 00:31:07,070
but it still

815
00:31:09,050 --> 00:31:11,301
as everyone is laughing like one second

816
00:31:11,301 --> 00:31:13,220
and everyone's laughter at this thing that

817
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:15,770
was perfect i said why oh it

818
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:19,040
and everyone stopped and i said coney

819
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:22,670
twenty twelve and then a couple people

820
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:24,860
felt bad and laughed and i was

821
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:27,770
like oh nah wasn't the in my

822
00:31:27,770 --> 00:31:28,250
mind

823
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:29,150
the point was

824
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:31,850
this thing that was just said was

825
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:33,710
perfect what i'm saying is lame and

826
00:31:33,710 --> 00:31:35,746
that was funny to me i guess

827
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:37,940
but i didn't know one could get

828
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:39,620
that at that oh everybody was like

829
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:40,850
oh no he really thought that was

830
00:31:40,850 --> 00:31:42,950
gonna be even funny oh my god

831
00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:45,710
that tells me it was mortifying isn't

832
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:47,690
like like it's always the worst i

833
00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:49,190
mean it happens all the time when

834
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:50,420
you're a funny person

835
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:51,320
in that you will say things that

836
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:53,030
aren't funny like just thank you

837
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:55,580
i mean but it's just it's a

838
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,110
natural part of being funny that you're

839
00:31:57,110 --> 00:31:59,150
gonna have some clunkers for sure but

840
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:01,400
it's the worst feeling in the world

841
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,987
i think like when you like things

842
00:32:02,987 --> 00:32:03,830
so it's gonna be funny and then

843
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:05,960
it's not i would rather bomb on

844
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:08,540
stage than have a joke knock over

845
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:10,100
in front of people in life

846
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:13,010
what's what's worse is when you say

847
00:32:13,010 --> 00:32:14,990
something really funny and your two friends

848
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:16,670
shit on you and say it's not

849
00:32:16,670 --> 00:32:19,070
funny but it actually is funny ca

850
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:21,260
you say something funny that doesn't happen

851
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:22,550
to me i think you guys are

852
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:24,290

00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:30,002

00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:33,560
be a virgin birth caused by the

929
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:36,560
holy spirit on the slide servant mary

930
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,000

931
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,640

932
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:41,780

he appears to zechariah and then he

937
00:35:49,409 --> 00:35:51,410

939
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:57,500
me because when you really think about

940
00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:00,230

like that that i did i'm like

1149
00:44:13,290 --> 00:44:16,440
so embarrassed oh it's mortifying yeah my

1150
00:44:16,470 --> 00:44:18,900
my entire life i wanna say before

1151
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:22,110
the age of forty one is mortifying

1152
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:23,640
so i haven't even had years not

1153
00:44:23,670 --> 00:44:25,560
growing until i'll be not mortified i

1154
00:44:25,590 --> 00:44:28,347
think you're doing okay lauren la yes

1155
00:44:28,347 --> 00:44:30,930

1156
00:44:30,930 --> 00:44:32,460
ever done i think i ate well

1157
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:35,007
that's obvious yeah you think you nail

1158
00:44:35,011 --> 00:44:37,140
every interaction i think that shows through

1159
00:44:38,310 --> 00:44:41,100
um and then and then i'm then

1160
00:44:41,250 --> 00:44:42,660
then i got an apartment i was

1161
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:43,830
in an apartment with

1162
00:44:45,270 --> 00:44:47,730
oh boy oh boy oh boy i

1163
00:44:47,730 --> 00:44:49,260
had a bunch of roommates at the

1164
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:51,720
same time at wo meaning they all

1165
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:53,550
moved in at the same time we

1166
00:44:53,550 --> 00:44:55,320
all moved into this house together this

1167
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:57,720
rowhouse well this won't happen here just

1168
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:00,330
for everyone who plays this game now

1169
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:02,700
we're gonna hear roommates too through whatever

1170
00:45:02,790 --> 00:45:04,728
you know with you yeah and

1171
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:06,720
they were all in the person and

1172
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:08,970
hear two through wherever you do we

1173
00:45:08,970 --> 00:45:11,040
do it by living space not by

1174
00:45:11,430 --> 00:45:14,820
the person although although right now yeah

1175
00:45:15,075 --> 00:45:16,200
you do it you do it by

1176
00:45:16,230 --> 00:45:19,500
chronologically meaning if you had three roommates

1177
00:45:19,530 --> 00:45:21,420
and then one moves out and another

1178
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:23,100
one moves in that that one who

1179
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:25,050
moves in that's your next one that

1180
00:45:25,050 --> 00:45:25,170
does

1181
00:45:25,170 --> 00:45:26,370

forget it

1237
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:43,800
so we lived in this in this

1238
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:46,800
house um which was not i remember

1239
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:49,830
the houses was pretty good but we

1240
00:47:49,830 --> 00:47:52,650
were all nobody was really that responsible

1241
00:47:52,650 --> 00:47:53,940
so things would get shut off like

1242
00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:56,280
we had a phone um that we

1243
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:57,630
all share that got shut off and

1244
00:47:57,630 --> 00:47:58,860
never turned back on again

1245
00:47:59,550 --> 00:48:01,470
i think our gas got turned off

1246
00:48:01,470 --> 00:48:03,150
so we couldn't cook and so when

1247
00:48:03,150 --> 00:48:04,128
your phone got turned off or you're

1248
00:48:04,128 --> 00:48:05,250
just like i don't have a phone

1249
00:48:05,250 --> 00:48:06,750
there's no way to reach me because

1250
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:10,260
that work one hundred percent right yes

1251
00:48:10,290 --> 00:48:12,750

00:48:12,750 --> 00:48:13,620
to be like i'm going to go

1253
00:48:13,620 --> 00:48:15,270

1375
00:52:23,865 --> 00:52:25,789
if they just start typing now but

1376
00:52:25,789 --> 00:52:27,735
i did typing in school and curse

1377
00:52:27,795 --> 00:52:29,385

1383
00:52:39,645 --> 00:52:40,005

1384
00:52:41,145 --> 00:52:43,155

want them to know how to read

1390
00:52:50,655 --> 00:52:52,575
it the generation before us

1391
00:52:53,625 --> 00:52:56,295
yeah sure i mean there's something intuitive

1392
00:52:56,295 --> 00:52:57,915
about it though reading it right there

1393
00:52:57,915 --> 00:52:58,965
to be look at it like this

1394
00:52:58,965 --> 00:53:02,044
is a foreign language really i mean

1395
00:53:02,055 --> 00:53:03,885
er geez i guess g's are the

1396
00:53:03,885 --> 00:53:07,065
biggest difference no but you know because

1397
00:53:07,245 --> 00:53:08,835
if you're just printing a lowercase g

1398
00:53:08,835 --> 00:53:10,725
it looks like a no yeah upper

1399
00:53:10,725 --> 00:53:13,515
case g doesn't look like the printed

1400
00:53:13,545 --> 00:53:13,755
upper

1401
00:53:13,785 --> 00:53:17,145
case g no it doesn't it's true

1402
00:53:17,325 --> 00:53:18,915
it looks like a shield or something

1403
00:53:19,245 --> 00:53:21,461

1404
00:53:21,461 --> 00:53:22,725

fido the person you don't have that's

1478
00:56:04,995 --> 00:56:07,305
just it's just a dog name like

1479
00:56:07,305 --> 00:56:10,125
why is it exclusively for dogs why

1480
00:56:10,125 --> 00:56:12,015
is fido where did even come from

1481
00:56:12,255 --> 00:56:14,235

fido i'd like to be about righto

1484
00:56:17,595 --> 00:56:19,455

1487
00:56:22,635 --> 00:56:25,125
hateful not surprisingly abraham lincoln named his

1488
00:56:25,125 --> 00:56:26,715
dog fido around five years before he

1489
00:56:26,715 --> 00:56:29,205
became president perhaps surprising from bouts of

1490
00:56:29,205 --> 00:56:31,575
depression pets often pulled him from anguish

1491
00:56:31,905 --> 00:56:33,735
that's just something i know my jesus

1492
00:56:35,025 --> 00:56:37,275
hold him from anguish what a weird

1493
00:56:37,275 --> 00:56:39,855
third sentence on the wikipedia entry for

1500
00:56:56,535 --> 00:56:58,731

i think we like had enough cushions

1664
01:02:28,300 --> 01:02:30,610
that they didn't and did you say

1665
01:02:30,610 --> 01:02:34,180

01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:35,740
i used to sleep i used

1667
01:02:35,803 --> 01:02:38,530

1668
01:02:38,530 --> 01:02:40,390
any trouble and actually you know i

1669
01:02:40,390 --> 01:02:43,330

1679
01:03:05,080 --> 01:03:06,940

1680
01:03:06,940 --> 01:03:08,950

executives was

1804
01:07:44,680 --> 01:07:47,260
so afraid of snakes that we could

1805
01:07:47,260 --> 01:07:50,050
not write snakes into the show no

1806
01:07:50,080 --> 01:07:51,640
we were not allowed because they said

1807
01:07:51,640 --> 01:07:53,110
cheek she won't be able to watch

1808
01:07:53,110 --> 01:07:55,120
the episode so she won't be able

1809
01:07:55,120 --> 01:07:56,860
to approve the episode if there's a

1810
01:07:56,860 --> 01:07:58,660
snake oh my she's so and it

1811
01:07:58,660 --> 01:08:00,970
hypnotized any comedy sketch that had a

1812
01:08:00,970 --> 01:08:03,820
snake so so at one point just

1813
01:08:03,820 --> 01:08:04,390
to be

1814
01:08:04,840 --> 01:08:06,370
to be funny or whatever we wrote

1815
01:08:07,180 --> 01:08:09,610
one sketch that that went up the

1816
01:08:09,610 --> 01:08:11,200
chain of like it was attack of

1817
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:12,490
the snakes and he was just like

1818
01:08:12,490 --> 01:08:14,530
ten pages of snakes jumping out all

1819
01:08:14,530 --> 01:08:15,944
the time and were like hey this

1820
01:08:15,944 --> 01:08:17,200
is this is the sketch we're really

1821
01:08:17,200 --> 01:08:20,290
interested in doing next and it came

1822
01:08:20,290 --> 01:08:21,880
back like they're like we can't even

1823
01:08:21,880 --> 01:08:24,550
show this to her the italy there's

1824
01:08:24,550 --> 01:08:24,970
no way

1825
01:08:24,970 --> 01:08:26,230
a you can ever do this back

1826
01:08:26,230 --> 01:08:28,450
of this and we're like what that's

1827
01:08:28,480 --> 01:08:30,010
it's really funny though don't you think

1828
01:08:30,010 --> 01:08:32,710
maybe i'm very intrigued did you try

1829
01:08:32,710 --> 01:08:34,150
to write it as a funny sketch

1830
01:08:35,080 --> 01:08:36,398
i don't actually try to make it

1831
01:08:36,398 --> 01:08:38,050
a rarely adjust it was purely just

1832
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:40,300
nature's others and it comes out exactly

1833
01:08:40,720 --> 01:08:42,100

can't know of this hobble but but

1837
01:08:48,820 --> 01:08:50,020
if you see a snake in the

1838
01:08:50,020 --> 01:08:52,000
first couple of years it's because we

1839
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:54,760

one because you wanted to have one

1843
01:08:59,980 --> 01:09:01,570

oh one player recites the lyrics of

1879
01:10:19,900 --> 01:10:21,790
a song using as many synonyms as

1880
01:10:21,790 --> 01:10:23,740
possible the other two try to guess

1881
01:10:23,740 --> 01:10:25,900
the song for example the lemon example

1882
01:10:27,010 --> 01:10:28,690

the look on their lyrics i was

1889
01:10:44,295 --> 01:10:45,105

the other person is reading the lyrics

1897
01:10:55,125 --> 01:10:57,225
to yeah we also deciphered the title

1898

yeah because i know we have to

1899
01:10:58,575 --> 01:10:59,625
