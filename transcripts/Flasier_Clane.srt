a lot of nostalgia is just like

146
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:41,670
remember when i was young and everything

147
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:42,240
was yeah

148
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,480
and it was so focused on just

149
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:48,240
remembering it as opposed to i don't

150
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,110
know i guess i don't know what

151
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:51,840
i thought would be but i i

152
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:53,700
it made me feel kind of sad

153
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:55,770
and then i was like wow it's

154
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:57,900
been seventeen years like i don't know

155
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,010
like it was just like yeah i

156
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:01,140
don't think i wasn't like i'm old

157
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:02,250
but i was kind of like

158
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:06,270
wow that felt like um a lot

159
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:08,730
of time has passed and then i

160
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:10,110
feel like i was like seeing until

161
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:12,180
their psyches and like it was just

162
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:15,360
like a lot right do you what

163
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:17,850
what was it mainly like them just

164
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:19,290
kind of going down memory lane and

165
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:20,850
james corden asking what about this what

166
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:22,230
about well it wasn't it wasn't just

167
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:22,560
the james

168
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:23,700
cord and stuff which i was happy

169
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,470
about like they see a lot of

170
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:27,990
time when they first arrived at the

171
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:29,640
actual studio they used to tape add

172
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:32,160
at a recreation of the set i

173
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,800
think they spent a whole day there

174
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,450
at least one or two days there

175
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:38,580
that's um and they kept inner cutting

176
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:41,940
stuff but so i think presentations yeah

177
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:42,720
they reenact

178
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,450
did screw they re-read scripts they played

179
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:46,830
games that they played on the show

180
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:47,940
all that kind of stuff without james

181
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,410
corden because the james core right was

182
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,400
there wasn't a lot of meat on

183
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,290
that bone i thought i agree but

184
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:53,880
i i didn't i didn't need them

185
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:55,260
to be like a fashion show with

186
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:58,830
like justin bieber it's so interesting yeah

187
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:03,260
here's my dirty foggy lady handling like

188
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:06,270
a from runway fashion show of like

189
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:09,689
highlights cup care ads ah listen they

190
00:07:09,689 --> 00:07:13,230
levine like doing these friendly crawford cindy

191
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:15,540
crawford doing friends costumes and stuff like

192
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:17,190
that but here's my theories is that

193
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:19,650
when you to get the friends reunion

194
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:20,160
they had to pay

195
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,200
pay those six people and inordinate amount

196
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,480
of money and once you have that

197
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,250
amount of well they have some working

198
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,740
since friends but once you have that

199
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,450
kind of money sunk into something you

200
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,340
have to start hedging your bets everywhere

201
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,590
and that's where the lady gaga of

202
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:36,570
it in the ceo last word wrong

203
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:38,190
but we didn't have to be yes

204
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:39,360
no you don't need any of that

205
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,320
stuff but once they say

206
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,700
send all that money they're like we

207
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:43,410
better put bts in this for ten

208
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:45,420
seconds otherwise we won't get the bts

209
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:48,900
fans wadala actually actually like the part

210
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,760
where they just talk to fans who

211
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,800
had gone through a hard normal fans

212
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:54,870
and friends was a show they watched

213
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:56,190
when they were going through something hard

214
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:57,840
and and that made me cry and

215
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,150
i thought lisa kudrow was fantastic and

216
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:00,420
she

217
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,770
seems really down to earth and matt

218
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:03,120
le blog seems really down to earth

219
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,620
i mean they oh they all seem

220
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,120
fine but it was just like i

221
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,100
think i wanted more of just them

222
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:11,910
talking yeah and and just a conversation

223
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:13,644
well that's what i did changing tamarind

224
00:08:13,644 --> 00:08:15,300
and stuff all that much because in

225
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,040
front of a live audience you're putting

226
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,930
on a show instead of yeah like

227
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:20,640
talking you know yeah yeah and i

228
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:21,632
like when they would be like oh

229
00:08:21,632 --> 00:08:22,950
do you remember this and someone's like

230
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:23,880
oh not really like when they were

231
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,620
just like hanging out that was more

232
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:27,240
interesting to me then someone would say

233
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:28,500
do you remember this the other person

234
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,900
would say oh not really yeah kinda

235
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:32,670
like it was feel like they were

236
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:34,410
like talking about if they've watched the

237
00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:35,370
show and some of them have never

238
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:38,190
really seen it and like then they

239
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:39,330
would i'd liked how they showed the

240
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:40,560
clips but then i think

241
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:42,090
i think that's what made me feel

242
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:43,800
kind of sad was like seeing the

243
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,711
clips and then like seeing them talk

244
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,860
with them and then they also said

245
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,259
that they haven't been they haven't gotten

246
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:51,030
in the same room since then and

247
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,580
there's no witches like not like yeah

248
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:55,410
really you were like i think two

249
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:56,970
of them probably moved to new york

250
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:58,290
or whatever or one of em you

251
00:08:58,290 --> 00:08:59,250
know what it means so it's like

252
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:00,780
all six haven't been in the same

253
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:00,960
room

254
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:02,940
it makes a long time though for

255
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:04,830
thirteen years yeah thank you there would

256
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:06,480
be some sort of informal like hey

00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,310
let's get up let's get together whenever

258
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:10,080

all okay and then he was the

372
00:13:18,325 --> 00:13:22,375
hanukkah armadillo or whatever armadillo that try

373
00:13:22,405 --> 00:13:24,265
network cara de levine came out and

374
00:13:24,265 --> 00:13:25,555
and just member what came out in

375
00:13:25,555 --> 00:13:28,435
the potato and you know what it's

376
00:13:28,465 --> 00:13:30,055
it's just it's too many things it's

377
00:13:30,055 --> 00:13:30,865
like i don't need

378
00:13:30,865 --> 00:13:32,635
if this level of distraction i wanna

379
00:13:32,635 --> 00:13:34,885
watch the friends talk yes but they're

380
00:13:34,885 --> 00:13:37,825
afraid that teenagers will not watch it

381
00:13:37,825 --> 00:13:39,205
unless yeah but it's like get over

382
00:13:39,205 --> 00:13:42,295
it like why did they advertise any

383
00:13:42,295 --> 00:13:43,885
of those people ominous funny word and

384
00:13:43,975 --> 00:13:45,955
word of mouth gets around oh god

385
00:13:46,015 --> 00:13:47,875
oh of course i check out justin

386
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:49,375
bieber and this potion show

387
00:13:50,545 --> 00:13:52,705
thankfully he didn't speak or anything but

388
00:13:53,155 --> 00:13:54,115
he just dance

389
00:13:57,415 --> 00:14:00,505
here's my here's my theory about about

390
00:14:00,505 --> 00:14:04,165
network television shows doing halloween episodes yeah

391
00:14:04,735 --> 00:14:07,105
is more more more more more it's

392
00:14:07,105 --> 00:14:10,255
really fun for the costume department it's

393
00:14:10,255 --> 00:14:12,145
really fun for them to make these

394
00:14:12,145 --> 00:14:15,205
elaborate things and it always whenever anyone

395
00:14:15,205 --> 00:14:15,505
shows

396
00:14:15,535 --> 00:14:16,855
up in one of these things i'm

397
00:14:16,855 --> 00:14:19,045
like this if any of my friends

398
00:14:19,045 --> 00:14:21,355
did something this involved they would have

399
00:14:21,655 --> 00:14:23,155
like it would be more involved than

400
00:14:23,185 --> 00:14:25,585
anything you know but every single person

401
00:14:26,095 --> 00:14:27,715
in the show is doing something that

402
00:14:27,715 --> 00:14:29,095
involved and it always takes me out

403
00:14:29,095 --> 00:14:30,715
of the scene it's very funny because

404
00:14:30,715 --> 00:14:31,885
it's like no one whatever just show

405
00:14:31,885 --> 00:14:32,785
up and like a wig and big

406
00:14:32,785 --> 00:14:34,525
yeah i had it laying around i'm

407
00:14:34,705 --> 00:14:35,665

00:14:59,935 --> 00:15:03,505
community and from everything and and all

435
00:15:40,615 --> 00:15:43,075

437
00:15:46,315 --> 00:15:49,315
haven't planned to halloween costume in ages

438
00:15:49,435 --> 00:15:50,965
and used to be such a bummer

439
00:15:50,965 --> 00:15:52,705
because i would wait until the day

440
00:15:52,705 --> 00:15:55,615
day of and then before halloween superstores

441
00:15:55,615 --> 00:15:56,935
were all the rage and they were

442
00:15:56,935 --> 00:15:59,605
open year round you'd have to try

443
00:15:59,605 --> 00:16:01,165
to find something at a store and

444
00:16:01,165 --> 00:16:02,245
they would be all sold out and

445
00:16:02,245 --> 00:16:03,025
then you would have to go to

446
00:16:03,025 --> 00:16:04,165
a thrift store there would be like

447
00:16:04,165 --> 00:16:05,215
a guy outside of the thrift store

448
00:16:05,215 --> 00:16:06,835

501
00:17:56,185 --> 00:17:59,335

ah star trek and i know this

503
00:18:00,895 --> 00:18:03,835
is not the pod directive and that's

504
00:18:03,835 --> 00:18:05,335
right but listen to the pod directive

505
00:18:05,905 --> 00:18:07,525
the other thing is is i'm sure

506
00:18:07,525 --> 00:18:09,325
this is well trod territory but it

507
00:18:09,325 --> 00:18:11,005
comes up every episode why are there

508
00:18:11,005 --> 00:18:14,305
no seatbelts that is w t and

509
00:18:14,305 --> 00:18:16,345
and i don't know the answer except

510
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:18,505
that they're in space well how about

511
00:18:18,715 --> 00:18:21,565
reality recap yeah get a garcia was

512
00:18:21,565 --> 00:18:22,615
not wearing a seatbelt in the backseat

513
00:18:22,615 --> 00:18:23,545
and i like a lot of people

514
00:18:23,545 --> 00:18:25,405
on reality tv don't wear a seatbelt

515
00:18:25,405 --> 00:18:26,245
when they're in the backseat of a

516
00:18:26,245 --> 00:18:29,005
car i don't like that did you

517
00:18:29,005 --> 00:18:32,935
say garson aircel who's that she's one

518
00:18:32,935 --> 00:18:34,465
of the real housewives so

519
00:18:34,645 --> 00:18:39,115
of where um beverly hills that's where

520
00:18:39,115 --> 00:18:40,825
i went ah back

521
00:18:41,935 --> 00:18:44,395
get a lot of halloween superstore episodes

522
00:18:44,605 --> 00:18:46,615
apparently okay well that goes because it's

523
00:18:46,615 --> 00:18:48,475
their warrant that would be stupid there's

524
00:18:48,475 --> 00:18:51,385
one where colton is where i think

525
00:18:51,385 --> 00:18:55,405
he's from coming to america and someone's

526
00:18:55,405 --> 00:18:56,965
a bee with a question mark on

527
00:18:56,965 --> 00:19:00,265
their body i don't think that means

528
00:19:00,295 --> 00:19:01,585
there's a lot of thinking

529
00:19:02,065 --> 00:19:04,495
mark mckinney is a cowardly lion type

530
00:19:04,555 --> 00:19:08,125
ah american airlines type yeah we were

531
00:19:08,125 --> 00:19:10,345
looking for a cowardly lion type

532
00:19:11,455 --> 00:19:14,245
ah this one actually is a little

533
00:19:14,245 --> 00:19:15,775
more realistic i feel like other than

534
00:19:15,775 --> 00:19:18,145
colton like colton's is too well well-made

535
00:19:18,145 --> 00:19:20,125
i think but everyone else looks appropriately

536
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:22,345
handmade i feel it would be fun

537
00:19:22,345 --> 00:19:25,045
to see more handmade costumes on halloween

538
00:19:25,045 --> 00:19:28,585
episodes yeah it was real shitty ones

539
00:19:28,795 --> 00:19:31,525

ssafa mufasa in fossa at the base

00:23:39,290 --> 00:23:41,420
of the hill after scars killed them

656
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:43,610
because she thought everyone would be so

657
00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:44,540
sad when they looked at the cake

658
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:45,740
that she would get to eat the

659
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:46,220
whole thing

660
00:23:47,390 --> 00:23:49,280
so any note i loved is ah

661
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:50,690
i knew it was true right when

662
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:54,080
i saw it but when someone's like

663
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,960
those know where the kids sunlit and

664
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,780
then someone like linked to the bakery

665
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:01,250
who had already posted about it and

666
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:02,330
how like they were so excited to

667
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:04,370
make this cake because this right request

668
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:05,540
of a butler and then there was

669
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:06,620
someone was like i'm glad she had

670
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:07,550
the receipts like there's just

671
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:09,232
like this whole like yeah it's just

672
00:24:09,352 --> 00:24:11,870
just a way everything goes believe anything

673
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:13,820
anymore because we believe anybody you're an

674
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:16,910
asshole but a very true but and

675
00:24:16,971 --> 00:24:18,680
i just i ascribed to a philosophy

676
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:21,410
um i think that um with kids

677
00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:24,170
especially there have been so many things

678
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:26,780
that people have said that you know

679
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:27,650
are not true

680
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:31,070
well knowing people disbelieve everything but i'm

681
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:32,540
like you'd have the whole cake made

682
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:33,914
and then make up that lie it

683
00:24:33,914 --> 00:24:37,100
exactly exactly this isn't a ruth condo

684
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:39,260
forever you know what i mean oh

685
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:41,961
that one oh it was amazing but

686
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:42,950
was that a joke or is that

687
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:44,390
someone really said i mean someone no

688
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:47,210
names someone someone truly claimed that their

689
00:24:47,210 --> 00:24:47,810
daughter app

690
00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:50,900
because chadwick boseman and ruth bader ginsburg

691
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:54,320
died in quick succession of most suspicious

692
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,420
of yes oh i think that impact

693
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:01,520
and um this woman ah tweeted that

694
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:05,150
her she had to tell her daughter

695
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:07,010
about the death of ruth bader ginsburg

696
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,000
and the child was like

697
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:10,220
young and it's also you don't have

698
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:11,720
to tell your children about the deaths

699
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:14,270
of supreme court justices at all no

700
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:17,540
just do it wastes time it's it's

701
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:19,100
out of their daily lives

702
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:23,450
and the the daughter according to this

703
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:25,854
woman and crossed her her arms over

704
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:28,130
chest in the in the wakanda forever

705
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:31,910
salute and said ruth ruth condo forever

706
00:25:32,826 --> 00:25:36,080
so that doesn't happen it's so unreal

707
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:39,170

741
00:26:54,170 --> 00:26:56,840

him when did he die oh ninety

743
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,810
oh ninety four oh yeah it would

744
00:26:59,810 --> 00:27:00,650
have been way too old

745
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:04,460
you're like twenty only but i opened

746
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:07,010
the memory you're probably just high

747
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:09,320
wait what was i do okay so

748
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:10,550
in ninety four i would have been

749
00:27:10,610 --> 00:27:13,070
back doing it off ninety four i

750
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:14,300
was doing what i was hearing o

751
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:15,800
j simpson did all that stuff and

752
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,320
drove by the olive garden the same

753
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,780
year same year yeah so yeah i

754
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:22,130
don't know i but it had no

755
00:27:22,130 --> 00:27:23,720
effect on my life were obviously i

756
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:25,160
don't even remember it do you think

757
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,150
oj killed richard nixon

758
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:30,380
oh it's suspicious on his ways i

759
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:32,000
have a lot of yellow anytime i

760
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,770
have a lot of questions it just

761
00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:35,930
drove over richard nixon well it's not

762
00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:37,100
too far off from where he was

763
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:38,480
driving because he drove by us in

764
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,860
orange county and richard nixon was in

765
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:43,490
yorba linda that's right but um i'll

766
00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:45,290
never forget that fateful day when i

767
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:47,180
watched that footage on tv

768
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:51,170
jackson stuff like his honor up to

769
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:54,530
the simpsons and then it was him

770
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:56,120
she's a white bronco for hours and

771
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:58,520
hours they don't make them like that

772
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:00,410
anymore one of the details in that

773
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:03,080
um oj was at o j made

774
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,970
in america the one that the miniseries

776
00:28:07,465 --> 00:28:07,550

777
00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:11,150
american ah oh right story american crime

that miniseries like we really enjoyed it

780
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,060
a lot um one of the details

781
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:18,800
that i did not realize was a

782
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:22,850
true thing was that um pizza pizza

783
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:24,830
places were running out of pizza yeah

784
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:26,780
because people were ordering pizza to watch

785
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:27,710
the chase so

786
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:29,360
that's i love that they included the

787
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,160
setting there that's all that's all based

788
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:33,470
on um a great book that was

789
00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:34,516
my favorite book about the trial i

790
00:28:34,516 --> 00:28:35,660
used to read books about the o

791
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:37,550
j trial wasn't just a toobin book

792
00:28:37,610 --> 00:28:39,080
yes good ol to

793
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:42,697
spare time he wrote a book oh

794
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:45,770
and a machine with that situation what

795
00:28:45,770 --> 00:28:48,380
happened when it did it i know

796
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:49,220
but i mean we all agree

797
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:52,910
finally every tube and releases a book

798
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:54,954
if i didn't know what i've done

799
00:28:54,954 --> 00:28:56,300
it i wanna stood up and pretended

800
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:57,350
i didn't know the timer was still

801
00:28:57,350 --> 00:28:57,560
going

802
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:02,330
so rose he got fired right yeah

803
00:29:02,570 --> 00:29:04,280
from whatever he was doing that's it

804
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:06,560
well what else now he's opening for

805
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:07,340
louis c k

806
00:29:09,890 --> 00:29:12,470
but his books were great ah yeah

807
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:15,620
about kenny hurst stanley good exposure whatever

808
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:19,640
what isn't considered like indecent exposure whatever

809
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:22,640
or two decent exposure it was decent

810
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,780
because of what i could turn off

811
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:25,490
my camera decent amount of

812
00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:28,040
but like isn't that isn't that a

813
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:29,660
thing like that i wouldn't argue with

814
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:30,980
more i would imagine it would be

815
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:32,240
right and you probably use it over

816
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,520
the internet i don't know you're technically

817
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:36,620
in a public place if you are

818
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:38,930
you know in a room but i

819
00:29:38,930 --> 00:29:41,270
guess your chat room you i guess

820
00:29:41,270 --> 00:29:43,670
you have reasonable doubt if you say

821
00:29:44,210 --> 00:29:45,680
no i didn't realize that was happening

822
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:46,670
because they can't prove that

823
00:29:46,670 --> 00:29:48,380
you knew who's the dude in summer

824
00:29:48,410 --> 00:29:50,210
in canada or whatever who's done it

825
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:52,610
justin trudeau oh no he's done it

826
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,050
like he took a shit on camera

827
00:29:54,050 --> 00:29:55,730
or something recently and he's like yeah

828
00:29:55,730 --> 00:29:57,440
it was the accidental second one where

829
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,000
he's like after the first one he's

830
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,890
like this will never happen again like

831
00:30:00,890 --> 00:30:02,240
he took a shit on camera i

832
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:03,560
think people were like who are you

833
00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:06,230
why what happened we have one days

834
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:06,830
ago oh

835
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:07,760
i didn't know about that but there

836
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,050
was one where like somebody he took

837
00:30:09,050 --> 00:30:10,700
their zoom into the bathroom and they

838
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:12,680
thought they realised that the yes yes

839
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:15,110
yes i remember that that's from saying

840
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:16,490
by the way speaking of zooms

841
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:18,770
i was talking about them with a

842
00:30:18,770 --> 00:30:20,360
friend recently we were saying like oh

843
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,560
they're so great you never have to

844
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:23,210
drive to the fox sly for meetings

845
00:30:23,210 --> 00:30:26,090
anymore but i i found something that's

846
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:27,440
bad about them

847
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:30,200
okay so

848
00:30:32,278 --> 00:30:33,800
are we supposed to chime in like

849
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:37,490
oh no so what's your mind be

850
00:30:37,490 --> 00:30:40,550

zoom and about how monkeys flat here

853
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:47,120
but yeah exactly it was like shabby

854
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,680
the ins the outs mainly the outs

855
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:51,140
um and i

856
00:30:52,185 --> 00:30:55,005

860
00:31:04,215 --> 00:31:06,975
before one o'clock i like was going

861
00:31:06,975 --> 00:31:08,715
over it and reciting it and all

862
00:31:08,715 --> 00:31:10,815

00:31:16,275 --> 00:31:18,765
yeah wow that's definitely an issue i

866
00:31:18,765 --> 00:31:19,905
feel like that's happened a lot where

867
00:31:19,905 --> 00:31:21,195
he's that will never happen if you're

868
00:31:21,225 --> 00:31:22,815
close to the fox lot they wouldn't

869
00:31:22,845 --> 00:31:24,975
cancel it started rolling away if if

870
00:31:24,975 --> 00:31:26,415
you drove to the box latte and

871
00:31:26,415 --> 00:31:28,515
they were running late they would say

872
00:31:28,515 --> 00:31:30,135
hey we're running late but we'll still

873
00:31:30,135 --> 00:31:31,935
see you whereas for me it was

874
00:31:31,935 --> 00:31:33,105
like what are you doing in two

875
00:31:33,105 --> 00:31:34,815
weeks like i'd prepped for a fence

876
00:31:34,815 --> 00:31:36,255
low noise yeah but

877
00:31:36,285 --> 00:31:39,146

878
00:31:39,198 --> 00:31:40,635
i'm sorry good well i know what

879
00:31:41,205 --> 00:31:42,015
i was just gonna say am i

880
00:31:42,015 --> 00:31:42,735
the only one that would have been

881
00:31:42,735 --> 00:31:45,675
psyched that i love when shits cancelled

882
00:31:45,675 --> 00:31:47,115

i was ready to do it exactly

884
00:31:48,945 --> 00:31:50,955

with a week of prep like yeah

886
00:31:52,965 --> 00:31:54,915

00:33:04,944 --> 00:33:06,135
forget about it and that's the other

923
00:33:06,135 --> 00:33:07,995
thing for so much rusher so so

924
00:33:07,995 --> 00:33:10,395
much momentum and and passion for it

925
00:33:10,395 --> 00:33:11,655
and then it's like oh by the

926
00:33:11,655 --> 00:33:12,893
way can you do this into two

927
00:33:13,125 --> 00:33:14,115
more weeks it's like well am i

928
00:33:14,115 --> 00:33:15,315
going to lose interest in this and

929
00:33:15,315 --> 00:33:18,315
two yeah uhm and then it's like

930
00:33:18,315 --> 00:33:19,785
why is it why is it two

931
00:33:19,785 --> 00:33:21,465
weeks from now that's when they're available

932
00:33:21,465 --> 00:33:23,085
it just feels like a long time

933
00:33:23,085 --> 00:33:23,265
and

934
00:33:23,715 --> 00:33:26,325
blah blah blah i think that's standard

935
00:33:26,325 --> 00:33:27,945
now that any if anything has postponed

936
00:33:27,945 --> 00:33:30,615
it's two weeks is that so it's

937
00:33:30,615 --> 00:33:31,935
like daylight savings time they made a

938
00:33:31,935 --> 00:33:34,635

recording regularly anymore while i'm curled see

990
00:35:25,365 --> 00:35:27,045

ddr like there's something about it that

992
00:35:28,605 --> 00:35:29,985

996
00:35:34,005 --> 00:35:35,925
like i have thought about canceling cable

997
00:35:35,925 --> 00:35:37,845
but then i i really like just

998
00:35:37,845 --> 00:35:40,170
having it as an option yeah well

999
00:35:40,185 --> 00:35:42,375

1000
00:35:42,405 --> 00:35:44,325
in case he starts chasing people again

1001
00:35:44,625 --> 00:35:45,945

1002
00:35:45,945 --> 00:35:48,105
chancy yeah i mean i i've i've

1003
00:35:48,105 --> 00:35:49,575

1009
00:36:01,394 --> 00:36:03,825
like oh hey how did that go

1010
00:36:04,005 --> 00:36:08,445
okay boys um we ah i feel

1011
00:36:08,445 --> 00:36:10,785
like there's not anything that we watch

1012
00:36:11,355 --> 00:36:12,915
night of any more it's been a

1013
00:36:12,915 --> 00:36:14,625
long time since we saw something else

1014
00:36:14,865 --> 00:36:18,015
da lu

1015
00:36:19,275 --> 00:36:21,915
tabs i watched a live i bet

1016
00:36:21,915 --> 00:36:23,655
when better call saul comes back we

1017
00:36:23,655 --> 00:36:26,655
will probably watch that yeah airs as

1018
00:36:26,655 --> 00:36:29,505
well mainly because there's stupid amc channels

1019
00:36:29,565 --> 00:36:31,035
are all on a terrible app and

1020
00:36:31,035 --> 00:36:33,825
that includes my show look apps for

1021
00:36:33,825 --> 00:36:36,495
the most part stink well yeah i

1022
00:36:36,495 --> 00:36:38,445
like em of it like him

1023
00:36:38,445 --> 00:36:40,725
mc plus or something there's too many

1024
00:36:40,755 --> 00:36:42,765
too many apps to any apps yeah

1025
00:36:42,795 --> 00:36:44,445
like i like the ones that combine

1026
00:36:44,445 --> 00:36:46,185
a whole bunch of different channels onto

1027
00:36:46,185 --> 00:36:48,885
one app like those discovery plus yeah

1028
00:36:48,885 --> 00:36:51,945
hbo max yeah but what i don't

1029
00:36:51,945 --> 00:36:54,525
like is like peacock sitting there with

1030
00:36:54,525 --> 00:36:57,045
only nbc shit and then they have

1031
00:36:57,045 --> 00:36:58,605
a super expensive tear

1032
00:36:58,605 --> 00:37:00,555
you're right that does it without the

1033
00:37:00,555 --> 00:37:01,845
ads and even though i can afford

1034
00:37:01,845 --> 00:37:02,985
it it's the principle of it so

1035
00:37:02,985 --> 00:37:04,400
i refuse to pay for it yeah

1036
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,925
well it's too many it's too many

1037
00:37:05,925 --> 00:37:07,155
little things i mean at that point

1038
00:37:07,155 --> 00:37:08,625
then you should cancel your cable and

1039
00:37:08,625 --> 00:37:09,975
then you pay one hundred dollars in

1040
00:37:10,545 --> 00:37:13,065
apps yeah but i like watching news

1041
00:37:13,065 --> 00:37:15,225
on cable live and stuff like that

1042
00:37:15,285 --> 00:37:16,575
yeah but i guess you could on

1043
00:37:16,575 --> 00:37:18,617
apps now that is the one you

1044
00:37:18,645 --> 00:37:18,765
could

1045
00:37:18,765 --> 00:37:19,965
good but it's not quite the same

1046
00:37:19,965 --> 00:37:20,955
like that is one of the things

1047
00:37:20,955 --> 00:37:22,305
that we will do every once in

1048
00:37:22,305 --> 00:37:24,165
a while with regular tv is watch

1049
00:37:24,165 --> 00:37:26,535
local news which is fun to do

1050
00:37:27,045 --> 00:37:28,275

1051
00:37:28,275 --> 00:37:30,435

1115
00:40:15,495 --> 00:40:17,805
oh do you know you know what

1116
00:40:17,835 --> 00:40:19,930
a note is you know no i

1117
00:40:20,025 --> 00:40:21,345
wish i had perfect pitch like chevy

1118
00:40:21,345 --> 00:40:23,145
chase but i don't yeah i have

1119
00:40:23,145 --> 00:40:26,025
a pronounced pro ball pretty cool well

1120
00:40:26,025 --> 00:40:27,495
who else can you name those perfect

1121
00:40:27,495 --> 00:40:28,335
pitch and my

1122
00:40:28,369 --> 00:40:30,495
friend i'm actually mike mularkey who did

1123
00:40:30,495 --> 00:40:32,805
our theme song these girls bitch yeah

1124
00:40:32,805 --> 00:40:33,975
so so does he have the kind

1125
00:40:33,975 --> 00:40:35,865
where you can say like you can

1126
00:40:35,865 --> 00:40:37,185
sing a note and he goes oh

1127
00:40:37,185 --> 00:40:40,875
that's a c-sharp probably probably but that's

1128
00:40:40,875 --> 00:40:43,365
so imagining a person like chevy chase

1129
00:40:43,365 --> 00:40:44,655
who has perfect pitch who can just

1130
00:40:44,655 --> 00:40:46,005
hear a song and then played on

1131
00:40:46,005 --> 00:40:48,015
a piano or it's just wish yeah

1132
00:40:48,015 --> 00:40:48,525
that's that

1133
00:40:48,615 --> 00:40:50,805
perfect pitch yeah where you just hear

1134
00:40:50,805 --> 00:40:51,735
it and go oh i know all

1135
00:40:51,735 --> 00:40:53,475
those notes and then you can just

1136
00:40:53,475 --> 00:40:54,345
read ah

1137
00:40:55,405 --> 00:40:58,525
ah okay alright i think paul what

1138
00:40:58,525 --> 00:41:00,385
you're thinking of though is someone who

1139
00:41:00,415 --> 00:41:02,665
can keep a perfect pitch in their

1140
00:41:02,665 --> 00:41:05,365
head not perfect pitch if that makes

1141
00:41:05,365 --> 00:41:08,845
sense it doesn't i don't know what

1142
00:41:08,875 --> 00:41:10,615
how did we get here guys i

1143
00:41:10,615 --> 00:41:14,335
don't know where we scared maybe ah

1144
00:41:14,605 --> 00:41:16,693
it's so cold here oh you know

1145
00:41:17,365 --> 00:41:20,125
you're on a horse yeah i just

1146
00:41:20,125 --> 00:41:24,445
mentioned perfect pitch absolut pitch woo absolute

1147
00:41:24,445 --> 00:41:26,665
pitch absolute pitch often called perfect pitch

1148
00:41:26,695 --> 00:41:28,255
is a rare ability of a person

1149
00:41:28,255 --> 00:41:31,735
to identify or recreate a given musical

1150
00:41:31,735 --> 00:41:33,595
note without the benefit of a reference

1151
00:41:33,595 --> 00:41:34,735
tone that's what i'm

1152
00:41:34,765 --> 00:41:36,295
thinking of that's what i mean meaning

1153
00:41:36,295 --> 00:41:37,645
if you hear a note you can

1154
00:41:37,645 --> 00:41:38,935
go oh that's a c-sharp and you

1155
00:41:38,935 --> 00:41:40,825
can recreate it right yeah

1156
00:41:42,535 --> 00:41:43,915
and more if somebody tells you do

1157
00:41:43,915 --> 00:41:45,295
that right now you can do it

1158
00:41:45,325 --> 00:41:46,315
yeah you can do it yeah i

1159
00:41:46,315 --> 00:41:48,295

00:43:51,055 --> 00:43:53,515
the excessive drop above a mass massive

1221
00:43:53,515 --> 00:43:56,155
massive drop and zip tie was scary

one i did was like very low

1245
00:44:42,565 --> 00:44:43,975
key compared to that it was um

1246
00:44:43,975 --> 00:44:45,355
at a camp that i worked up

yeah but i get scared that kinda

1252
00:44:59,725 --> 00:45:00,895
shit i think i'm more scared with

1253
00:45:00,895 --> 00:45:02,365
the climbing up than i am with

1254
00:45:02,365 --> 00:45:04,825
the going zipping you know this was

1255
00:45:04,825 --> 00:45:07,225
not climbing mine was not climbing up

1256
00:45:07,225 --> 00:45:09,835
you literally like walked away from the

1257
00:45:09,835 --> 00:45:11,605
hotel about

1258
00:45:11,935 --> 00:45:13,615
three minutes and then you were at

1259
00:45:13,615 --> 00:45:15,835
the edge it was like we just

1260
00:45:15,835 --> 00:45:16,795
had an edge so you just like

1261
00:45:16,795 --> 00:45:18,235
hook yourself up to it there was

1262
00:45:18,235 --> 00:45:20,002
no climb it was just laying and

1263
00:45:20,002 --> 00:45:21,805
then you just step off and that's

1264
00:45:21,805 --> 00:45:23,755
better but that's still scary i think

1265
00:45:23,785 --> 00:45:26,365
they said it's the height drop that

1266
00:45:26,365 --> 00:45:28,105
is the scary part to me yeah

1267
00:45:28,765 --> 00:45:30,625
but i scared anything be fun are

1268
00:45:30,625 --> 00:45:31,795
you scared of heights in general

1269
00:45:32,635 --> 00:45:34,345
um yeah i guess so i mean

1270
00:45:34,705 --> 00:45:36,115

for the robot to like try to

1317
00:47:20,275 --> 00:47:21,865

1318
00:47:21,865 --> 00:47:24,385
that they were very durable jeans and

1319
00:47:24,385 --> 00:47:26,035

fifty robots wearing some nineteen seventies jeans

1327

um but tuscans were stiff as shit

1328
00:47:45,115 --> 00:47:46,615

00:47:46,765 --> 00:47:48,085
like they would hurt the backs of

00:47:48,085 --> 00:47:50,395
your knees yeah because they were so

1331
00:47:50,395 --> 00:47:52,345
stiff and the chords would always make

1332
00:47:52,345 --> 00:47:54,706
the scene yeah whenever you walked in

1333
00:47:54,715 --> 00:47:55,765

in brazil b r z i l

1500
00:53:51,495 --> 00:53:54,195
e um two people play a scene

1501
00:53:54,225 --> 00:53:57,885
and anytime yes exactly that's why i

1502
00:53:57,945 --> 00:54:00,375
i'm pronouncing but maybe it's brazil bra

1503
00:54:00,375 --> 00:54:01,935
v

1504
00:54:03,525 --> 00:54:05,415
two people play a scene and at

1505
00:54:05,415 --> 00:54:07,665
any time the third person can call

1506
00:54:07,665 --> 00:54:08,865
one of the members in the scene

1507
00:54:08,865 --> 00:54:11,415
and give them menacing information about the

1508
00:54:11,415 --> 00:54:13,545
scene slash other player that impacts the

1509
00:54:13,545 --> 00:54:15,975
scene example is he really who he

1510
00:54:15,975 --> 00:54:17,865
says he is you get the idea

1511
00:54:17,865 --> 00:54:20,295
says camden camden maybe we're not as

1512
00:54:20,295 --> 00:54:21,675
smart as you think yeah maybe you

1513
00:54:21,675 --> 00:54:23,175
want to list a couple other

1514
00:54:23,595 --> 00:54:25,215
but here's the thing so i think

1515
00:54:25,215 --> 00:54:27,195
that the third person who's not in

1516
00:54:27,195 --> 00:54:30,045
the scene can call either person throughout

1517
00:54:30,045 --> 00:54:32,955
the scene yeah um and give them

1518
00:54:32,955 --> 00:54:34,605
information so i think it sounds like

1519
00:54:34,605 --> 00:54:35,475
fun the way we're gonna do it

1520
00:54:35,475 --> 00:54:36,975

1521
00:54:37,245 --> 00:54:39,105
we will ah when we are the

1522
00:54:39,105 --> 00:54:41,685
color will mute our microphones so you

1523
00:54:41,685 --> 00:54:42,945
the listener will hear

1524
00:54:43,365 --> 00:54:46,035
the um the phone calls but the

1525
00:54:46,065 --> 00:54:48,225
other players will the other player will

1526
00:54:48,225 --> 00:54:51,555

1527
00:54:51,555 --> 00:54:53,415

hear the phone call the player who

1529
00:54:54,975 --> 00:54:56,925
