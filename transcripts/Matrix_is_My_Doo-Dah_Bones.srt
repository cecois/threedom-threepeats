poster so he could see the people

78
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:58,230
looking at the poster yeah so you

79
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:00,810
can read the title below it's lucky

80
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:01,170
for the

81
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,590
you are talking about the map at

82
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:06,810
the mall was hard to read with

83
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:09,000
them yes it was these sunglasses too

84
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:11,430
yeah yeah you were talking about the

85
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:13,200
map at the mall this was on

86
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:17,480
doe off boys de da boys and

87
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:18,720
when he went to hotdog on a

88
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,740
stick at the mall and couldn't read

89
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:21,690
the map because it's glasses or tend

90
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:21,840
to

91
00:03:21,905 --> 00:03:23,430
and of course the map is a

92
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:26,190
screen is not friendly to that yes

93
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:27,510
and so i couldn't find the lids

94
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,790
and finally i wanted to go to

95
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:31,320
live and she just ask every single

96
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:34,260
bullshit that has excuse me know because

97
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:35,940
i never found it i really did

98
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:37,530
look why walked our hell i think

99
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:39,060
i know where you could ask anyone

100
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,200
who worked in the mall and they

101
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,820
would tell you where i kept thinking

102
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:43,500
i was gonna find it but you

103
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,413
didn't but that mollis no i didn't

104
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:46,980
and i gave up that mosque a

105
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:48,720
major problem imo

106
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,548
all is amaze which mall which mandela

107
00:03:50,548 --> 00:03:53,130
galleria it is like how you turn

108
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:55,590
a corner and it's crazy anyways like

109
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:57,570
yeah and you keep thinking okay this

110
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:59,070
is the end and then you you

111
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:00,840
like walk a little further and then

112
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,370
there's like a hallway where there's a

113
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:04,140
bunch more swords i want to fuck

114
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:08,070
oh scott that song is not good

115
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:11,550
artistically artistically and morally

116
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:13,830
do you know it's awkward talking about

117
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:16,830
no the doors the doors based on

118
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:19,560
the doors knowledge is limited the classic

119
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:20,370
oedipus rex

120
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:21,480
yeah

121
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:23,970
the whole song is based on it

122
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:25,260
or just that part i don't know

123
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,730
i just know that it was like

124
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,680
shocking video and father i want to

125
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,360
kill you mother i want to

126
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:36,182
a shocking it sounds disgusting it's well

127
00:04:36,182 --> 00:04:37,170
it depends on your mom like it

128
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:39,570
proves he he read your ma that's

129
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:42,090
nasty that proves he reads but more

130
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:43,890
on that das nasty but if he

131
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:45,750
didn't read it his own new thoughts

132
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,120
and guess what i oh like oedipus

133
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:48,360
rex

134
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:52,916
oedipus who who tapas february first that

135
00:04:52,916 --> 00:04:53,670
band was popular

136
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,360
he's a model who read three books

137
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,700
write the doors of perception yeah abstract

138
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,540
and do you think he read all

139
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:01,590
of them or do you read the

140
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:02,130
back of the book

141
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,430
good question what was the third though

142
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:08,190
because he has to have ups like

143
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:09,720
a song based you know the compilation

144
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,690
do you think if you never read

145
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:13,980
like your brain starts to die in

146
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:14,670
little parts

147
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:18,390
i think we're our brains all start

148
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:20,220
to die every day oh no i

149
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,360

152
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:26,850

198
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:48,840

me and not my book but that

203
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:53,760

not to be reading her book in

front of her she wanted it but

206
00:06:56,274 --> 00:06:57,000
she would want to know what you're

207
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,160
thinking people who write a book about

208
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,510
themselves they want you to read in

moving back kids icast about such topics

232
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:55,650

233
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:58,020
chelsea advantage has a podcast about celebrity

234
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:00,780
memoirs other podcasts because we're about to

235
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:01,800
take a break on this one i

236
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,360
don't want someone to have people listen

237
00:08:03,362 --> 00:08:04,710
to other ones i'm going anyway i

238
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:06,720
heard her retry her on yet another

239
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,950
their podcast deep dive and i thought

240
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:08,850
she's really funny and i was like

241
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,020
oh this sounds like my kind of

242
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:12,028
podcasts i love summary memoirs but i

243
00:08:12,028 --> 00:08:12,930
don't know time to read all of

244
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:14,280
them and some of them are fluffier

245
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,210
than others and maybe you just want

246
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:15,990
to hear some what do they do

247
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:18,150
they they summarize them hey okay i

248
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:19,410
don't know i haven't lived through to

249
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:20,910
the book but they read and they

250
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:22,470
talk about well you are rude to

251
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:24,870
books by completely ignoring them i remember

252
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:26,400
hearing a conversation between two people that

253
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:26,880
i knew

254
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:30,000
a man who intrigued were both saying

255
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,530
that they do not like to read

256
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:34,860
fiction books because what's the point because

257
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:36,450
it's almost like you watch movies or

258
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:38,640
tv exactly but i don't think we

259
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:40,770
thought to have precious that's how i

260
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:43,200
felt after pressures because precious precious is

261
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,490
set up my based on the novel

262
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,470
push by sapphire but it it feels

263
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:47,010
like a true

264
00:08:47,047 --> 00:08:48,600
story where it's like oh this is

265
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,220
based on someone's real life i want

266
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:51,810
to say other you but it's it's

267
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,910
filmed like that and then all these

268
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:56,640
terrible things happen including aids and then

269
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,140
at the end it's like you read

270
00:08:58,140 --> 00:08:59,700
it's just fiction it's like well yeah

271
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:01,320
i could write someone having a bunch

272
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,910
of terrible things happening to them that

273
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:04,410
movie i might have said this before

274
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:05,490
but that was like the one of

275
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:07,200
the first times i hung out alone

276
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,520
phone with my sister-in-law we went to

277
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,690
see precious and we're both like

278
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:13,108
yeah i was like this isn't really

279
00:09:13,108 --> 00:09:15,300
what are we thinking writing right carey's

280
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:17,639
moustache a moustache and a chimp a

281
00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:19,980
mustache and ah i don't think super

282
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:22,800
mario brothers oh that's right super samurai

283
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:23,190
brother

284
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:30,360
right so we gotta make that mean

285
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:32,190
oh no it's a race to make

286
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:33,745
this guy to make that mean well

287
00:09:33,745 --> 00:09:35,655
you gotta make that me like zama

288
00:09:35,689 --> 00:09:36,960
to legs have a mustache in that

289
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:39,330
movie ah he should but i don't

290
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:40,710
believe me very over he didn't duty

291
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:41,729
i'm kind of seeing the poster in

292
00:09:41,729 --> 00:09:43,770
my mind yeah i say deal and

293
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:44,400
i think they're all from

294
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,870
new jersey when they say mario

295
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,840
i think that's simply not the name

296
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,310
like maria lopez so what did i

297
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:52,050
say just no you said mario okay

298
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:54,480
but people say marrow and i think

299
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,740
it's only on people i know from

300
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:58,620
new jersey maybe other states saying but

301
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:00,120
i'm like that's not what the name

302
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:02,340
is yeah why are you saying that

303
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:03,840
you know what's weird is right yes

304
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,190
it's like saying if somebody's name is

305
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:06,720
steven and you call them stefan right

306
00:10:07,405 --> 00:10:09,505
i can't figure out my friend kerryn

307
00:10:10,165 --> 00:10:11,695
everyone always when they read her name

308
00:10:11,695 --> 00:10:15,835
goes crying wow come on it's insanity

309
00:10:16,135 --> 00:10:18,145
and like everyone does it yeah it's

310
00:10:18,145 --> 00:10:21,235
arrive arise that's really weird very strange

311
00:10:21,235 --> 00:10:22,945
it's very clearly to oh not a

312
00:10:22,945 --> 00:10:24,475
name no one's ever heard in their

313
00:10:24,475 --> 00:10:26,185
life i know i don't mean that

314
00:10:26,365 --> 00:10:27,535
more unusual but i'm saying yes

315
00:10:27,535 --> 00:10:29,725
yes i you could kind of guess

316
00:10:29,725 --> 00:10:31,075
corinne probably isn't it

317
00:10:32,125 --> 00:10:34,015
yeah it's very it's very odd i

318
00:10:34,015 --> 00:10:35,755
can't figure that one out but everyone

319
00:10:35,785 --> 00:10:37,765
does this corinne first or like something

320
00:10:37,765 --> 00:10:40,435
like that maybe it's korean morrison no

321
00:10:40,435 --> 00:10:42,895

don't know you don't know anything so

969
00:33:29,929 --> 00:33:31,535
good i don't think he's that good

970
00:33:31,595 --> 00:33:33,095
he was good for like a good

971
00:33:33,095 --> 00:33:34,654
ten years but even the stuff that's

972
00:33:34,654 --> 00:33:35,645
supposed to be so bad i don't

973
00:33:35,645 --> 00:33:37,895
think i know but it but it's

974
00:33:37,895 --> 00:33:39,575
good every ending is tara

975
00:33:39,575 --> 00:33:40,955
able i know but it's hard to

976
00:33:40,955 --> 00:33:42,785
end things like look at this episode

977
00:33:42,785 --> 00:33:44,465
it's hard to end it's hard to

978
00:33:44,465 --> 00:33:45,785
end things but like i think if

979
00:33:45,785 --> 00:33:47,225
you're me you have things like that

980
00:33:47,225 --> 00:33:48,815
you should find an ending feeling of

981
00:33:48,875 --> 00:33:50,849
it is so bad but it's yeah

982
00:33:50,849 --> 00:33:52,085
i can shrivel up into oil or

983
00:33:52,085 --> 00:33:53,435
something i can't remember what

984
00:33:54,665 --> 00:33:56,735
he dribbled up into oil shriveled up

985
00:33:56,825 --> 00:33:58,415
oh it turns out he's a big

986
00:33:58,865 --> 00:34:01,505
alien easily luckily oh yeah writers yeah

987
00:34:01,535 --> 00:34:03,065
he blew up in all those bugs

988
00:34:03,725 --> 00:34:05,375
something like that yeah his head got

989
00:34:05,375 --> 00:34:07,295
really big he should just swap endings

990
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:08,795
with his other books so it's like

991
00:34:08,825 --> 00:34:10,655
okay christine yeah he dribbles up in

992
00:34:10,685 --> 00:34:12,815
oil he dribbles out of total oil

993
00:34:12,995 --> 00:34:14,615
yeah that makes sense yeah because

994
00:34:14,795 --> 00:34:16,325
yes he dribbles up in oil yeah

995
00:34:16,415 --> 00:34:18,185
cujo cujo happens to be a big

996
00:34:18,185 --> 00:34:19,925
alien cuyo he was up in oil

997
00:34:19,955 --> 00:34:23,015

1000
00:34:26,135 --> 00:34:27,815
the fire i asked that because this

1001
00:34:27,815 --> 00:34:28,775
all makes sense steven

1002
00:34:31,205 --> 00:34:32,765
the trailer for kerry by the way

1003
00:34:32,795 --> 00:34:34,955
gives away the entire movie yeah some

1004
00:34:34,955 --> 00:34:36,665
like an age i think they did

1005
00:34:36,665 --> 00:34:38,465
that yeah dinner he gets old one

1006
00:34:38,465 --> 00:34:40,325
gets thinner more and he escapes from

1007
00:34:40,325 --> 00:34:43,205
jail with his best friend i start

1008
00:34:43,211 --> 00:34:45,365
through a poster railers for that reason

1009
00:34:45,395 --> 00:34:46,325
i thought i'm just like go through

1010
00:34:46,325 --> 00:34:47,345
the bars because he got was getting

1011
00:34:47,405 --> 00:34:48,845
yeah that's right he doesn't need the

1012
00:34:48,845 --> 00:34:50,105
poster see this makes more

1013
00:34:50,135 --> 00:34:52,025

1036
00:35:28,025 --> 00:35:29,525
it's gonna blow your mind you know

1037
00:35:30,185 --> 00:35:32,915
one but it was like that movie

1038
00:35:32,947 --> 00:35:33,575

1039
00:35:33,575 --> 00:35:34,655
thing again which i haven't had since

1040
00:35:34,655 --> 00:35:35,915

1046
00:35:45,335 --> 00:35:46,955
unfamiliar to me so i was very

1047
00:35:46,955 --> 00:35:48,605

wrote back to me immediately waiting you're

1362
00:46:52,912 --> 00:46:54,250
back already

1363
00:46:56,050 --> 00:46:57,430
when we finally circled back to the

1364
00:46:57,430 --> 00:46:58,510
important things

1365
00:47:00,730 --> 00:47:03,520
um but in being john malkovich when

1366
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:05,050
you when you're like portals out of

1367
00:47:05,050 --> 00:47:07,720
hand this isn't a movie podcast you're

1368
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:10,360
all wet jesus so he's saying really

1369
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:12,190
oh wait remember oh and don't like

1370
00:47:12,190 --> 00:47:14,320
the highway like ah oh that's oh

1371
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:17,350
i thought it productive ludicrous know ludicrous

1372
00:47:17,350 --> 00:47:18,340
i don't know if you end up

1373
00:47:18,340 --> 00:47:19,570
all wet was humid and wet do

1374
00:47:19,570 --> 00:47:19,810
you think

1375
00:47:19,810 --> 00:47:21,040
if ludicrous i would assume he's taking

1376
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:22,930
a bathroom to it's room the idea

1377
00:47:22,930 --> 00:47:26,170
to live out ah day as someone

1378
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:27,610
else yeah it's like we've day i

1379
00:47:27,730 --> 00:47:28,990
died i would do that it's like

1380
00:47:28,990 --> 00:47:31,030
if i died i think i'd want

1381
00:47:31,030 --> 00:47:32,860
to probably be me again and he's

1382
00:47:32,860 --> 00:47:34,450
yeah people i love but i guess

1383
00:47:34,450 --> 00:47:35,920
if i had to be somebody out

1384
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:36,910
if you could be one of the

1385
00:47:36,910 --> 00:47:39,730
people you loved that's weird i think

1386
00:47:39,730 --> 00:47:39,970
i would

1387
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,830
choose if it has to be someone

1388
00:47:41,830 --> 00:47:43,112
you're not related to and it to

1389
00:47:43,112 --> 00:47:44,740
mean you don't know i think sbs

1390
00:47:44,740 --> 00:47:46,930
like a celebrity but wait so in

1391
00:47:46,930 --> 00:47:48,970
being john malkovich or you you're not

1392
00:47:48,970 --> 00:47:51,370
controlling john malkovich u r l r

1393
00:47:51,370 --> 00:47:52,510
as much as you can as much

1394
00:47:52,510 --> 00:47:53,860
as you can yeah but you're kind

1395
00:47:53,860 --> 00:47:55,420
of like in the back seat right

1396
00:47:55,420 --> 00:47:57,610
yeah yeah yeah i guess i would

1397
00:47:57,610 --> 00:47:59,470
pick if that's if that's the idea

1398
00:47:59,470 --> 00:48:00,130
i guess it would be

1399
00:48:00,130 --> 00:48:02,890
the peter o'toole and like ah a

1400
00:48:02,890 --> 00:48:04,960

1518
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:12,330

1521
00:52:14,970 --> 00:52:17,220
really like to fry us news network

1522
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,220
don't they talk about how never happened

1523
00:52:20,340 --> 00:52:22,620
they they originally the news was supposed

1524
00:52:22,620 --> 00:52:24,180
to not sell advertising and it would

1525
00:52:24,180 --> 00:52:25,230
have been so much better for the

1526
00:52:25,230 --> 00:52:27,210
company for the country yeah the company

1527
00:52:27,210 --> 00:52:28,170
i call it look

1528
00:52:28,560 --> 00:52:30,420
the company we live in the company

1529
00:52:30,420 --> 00:52:31,470
of the united states of america you

1530
00:52:31,470 --> 00:52:33,540
know if but but because then they

1531
00:52:33,540 --> 00:52:35,400
allowed everyone to sell advertising on it

1532
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:39,090
than they compete for ratings and they're

1533
00:52:39,090 --> 00:52:44,670
enslaved by corporate mon tresor yes but

1534
00:52:44,850 --> 00:52:46,350
imagine a world where the news had

1535
00:52:46,350 --> 00:52:48,330

johnny carson did against george i don't

1717
01:00:06,510 --> 01:00:07,560

1718
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:09,330
have a man do my topics it's

1719
01:00:09,330 --> 01:00:10,620
not going to make me cry man's

1720
01:00:10,620 --> 01:00:12,180
plane whatever i'm talking about yeah your

1721
01:00:12,180 --> 01:00:13,260
topics yeah it's your

1722
01:00:13,380 --> 01:00:14,370
people will be aware that i had

1723
01:00:14,370 --> 01:00:16,140
nothing to do with it yeah yeah

1724
01:00:16,410 --> 01:00:17,670
okay what do you think is going

1725
01:00:17,670 --> 01:00:20,430
to happen next season firm like anything

1726
01:00:20,430 --> 01:00:21,930
i'm gonna announce or i want to

1727
01:00:21,930 --> 01:00:23,280
talk about yeah what do you think

1728
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:24,330
we're gonna talk about do you think

1729
01:00:24,330 --> 01:00:26,010
will tell what stories do you think

1730
01:00:26,010 --> 01:00:28,080
will retail these are good predictions i

1731
01:00:28,080 --> 01:00:29,580
think i'll probably tell stories that i've

1732
01:00:29,580 --> 01:00:31,500
told before i think that might happen

1733
01:00:31,530 --> 01:00:33,420
and i'll probably talk a lot

1734
01:00:33,450 --> 01:00:34,830
about you know just my life and

1735
01:00:34,830 --> 01:00:36,750
stuff great ball what do you think

1736
01:00:36,750 --> 01:00:39,060
it's going to happen well my goal

1737
01:00:39,570 --> 01:00:42,060
is to repeat zero stories and the

1738
01:00:42,060 --> 01:00:43,620
next whoa i mean that's a big

1739
01:00:43,620 --> 01:00:45,810
challenge i really do want to encourage

1740
01:00:45,810 --> 01:00:47,730
the listeners out there to create a

1741
01:00:47,730 --> 01:00:50,010
threesome wiki where if we start telling

1742
01:00:50,010 --> 01:00:51,810
a story it lists every story we've

1743
01:00:51,810 --> 01:00:53,370
ever told yes and if we start

1744
01:00:53,370 --> 01:00:53,573
telling

1745
01:00:54,280 --> 01:00:55,480
never say this we can look it

1746
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:56,920
up on the wiki immediately and go

1747
01:00:56,950 --> 01:00:58,150
oh i did i think and also

1748
01:00:58,210 --> 01:00:59,475
what how many times you've told it

1749
01:00:59,665 --> 01:01:00,700
has to be a code where it's

1750
01:01:00,700 --> 01:01:02,650
just like two words that trigger the

1751
01:01:02,650 --> 01:01:03,610
idea of the sword because i don't

1752
01:01:03,610 --> 01:01:05,110
