00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:21,030
open their mouth i say everyone's already

215
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:22,740
saying yeah everyone's talking about how to

216
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:24,750

why did anyone say i forgot other

219
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:28,620
people were also talking about this other

220
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:30,600
person yeah and they were the ones

221
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,640
who make the decision so yeah i

222
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:33,840
um but i wow

223
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,760
not to interject but i but here

224
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:38,370
we go yeah but i hated when

225
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:40,170
people would do that around me where

226
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:42,090
they would like promise people jobs it's

227
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:44,024
crazy yeah there's just so early yeah

228
00:07:44,024 --> 00:07:45,720
yeah so what to the point where

229
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,430
i do the opposite where i'm always

230
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:49,260
like you'll never get the i know

231
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:51,270

232
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:53,550

234
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,400
no but i had friends who would

235
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,420
do that all the time where it

236
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:59,880
was like oh your show is ordered

237
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:00,930
and then they go hey you're gonna

238
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:01,980

gonna work for me and me and

241
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,000
then get the budget and it's like

242
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,050
you could only afford to have no

243
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:08,820
control and then and then they would

244
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:10,440
never talk to the person that they

245
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,520
said they were gonna hire the person

246
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,233

let's get away for a couple of

297
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:58,470
days because i can't sleep why because

298
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:00,269
you know how previously on three-day and

299
00:10:00,269 --> 00:10:02,280
we talked about how we take turns

300
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:05,460
monitoring the baby when it's my turn

301
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:07,050
i turned down the monitor really low

302
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:09,690
because anything will wake me up and

303
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:10,800
i don't want to wake cool up

304
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:13,975
i'm from korea monitors taking care of

305
00:10:13,975 --> 00:10:14,665
it why do you have to

306
00:10:15,895 --> 00:10:17,335
yeah no but i turned down so

307
00:10:17,335 --> 00:10:19,285
low because any any noise no matter

308
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:21,205
how low will wake me up i

309
00:10:21,205 --> 00:10:22,255
don't want cool up to be well

310
00:10:22,285 --> 00:10:25,135
yeah ooh but when cool off it's

311
00:10:25,135 --> 00:10:26,725
her turn she turns it up all

312
00:10:26,725 --> 00:10:29,035
the way because she sleeps so deeply

313
00:10:29,305 --> 00:10:31,915
that this system i think you gotta

314
00:10:31,945 --> 00:10:32,935
figure this out you need to her

315
00:10:32,935 --> 00:10:35,875
bedroom style so

316
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:37,135
so pretty much every single day i'm

317
00:10:37,135 --> 00:10:38,965
woken up um but she was just

318
00:10:38,965 --> 00:10:40,825
like you're you're really tired yeah i

319
00:10:40,825 --> 00:10:42,235

329
00:11:00,925 --> 00:11:02,245

will look at each other and say

401
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:26,935

402
00:13:27,415 --> 00:13:28,165
i love one so

403
00:13:28,405 --> 00:13:31,585
i i really hate when people say

404
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:33,295
it happens a lot on like reality

405
00:13:33,295 --> 00:13:35,365
tv testimonials like we're will say like

406
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:38,395
so much like me like him and

407
00:13:38,395 --> 00:13:40,255
me is like it's like you think

408
00:13:40,255 --> 00:13:41,665
you just like wow what are you

409
00:13:41,755 --> 00:13:43,882
saying him it was the langley and

410
00:13:43,882 --> 00:13:44,991
when i had to go get him

411
00:13:44,995 --> 00:13:46,825
and me his breakfast like yeah it's

412
00:13:46,825 --> 00:13:48,085
just like saying oh just stop

413
00:13:48,385 --> 00:13:49,915
that stuff doesn't the only thing that

414
00:13:49,915 --> 00:13:52,285
bothers me is when people get expressions

415
00:13:52,285 --> 00:13:55,405
wrong and the and the only reason

416
00:13:55,405 --> 00:13:56,815
it bothers me is because of course

417
00:13:56,815 --> 00:13:58,465
i know what they mean it's not

418
00:13:58,465 --> 00:13:59,545
that it's not that i feel like

419
00:13:59,545 --> 00:14:01,945
they're being precise precisely that some expressions

420
00:14:01,945 --> 00:14:03,625
are really good and it's like you're

421
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:06,475
funny cherish them like what's an example

422
00:14:06,535 --> 00:14:07,315
if you can think of what it

423
00:14:07,315 --> 00:14:07,975
might be hard to think of

424
00:14:08,545 --> 00:14:09,565
you know what a classic one is

425
00:14:09,565 --> 00:14:12,144
buck naked and people say butt naked

426
00:14:12,144 --> 00:14:13,705
yes yeah it doesn't make any fucking

427
00:14:13,705 --> 00:14:15,535
sense while you're while you're fucking naked

428
00:14:15,535 --> 00:14:17,125
it actually makes more sense than buck

429
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:19,225
naked no it doesn't because buck naked

430
00:14:19,225 --> 00:14:21,745
originated from buck rogers that one episode

431
00:14:21,745 --> 00:14:22,435
where he was naked

432
00:14:24,085 --> 00:14:25,255
which was rare because in the twenty

433
00:14:25,255 --> 00:14:27,205
four time chinese originated no no many

434
00:14:27,385 --> 00:14:28,615
there's so many colors i thought it

435
00:14:28,615 --> 00:14:29,965
was because you buck your clothes up

436
00:14:29,965 --> 00:14:30,685
like a horse

437
00:14:32,335 --> 00:14:34,585

soul it just gets trapped

523
00:17:39,385 --> 00:17:41,365
i imagine right yeah just there's a

524
00:17:41,365 --> 00:17:43,855
school of thought that you don't want

525
00:17:43,855 --> 00:17:45,745
to be cremate creamy cream green bay

526
00:17:45,805 --> 00:17:47,965
ruminated because what if i don't crave

528
00:17:49,165 --> 00:17:51,415
have sensors to pick it up okay

529
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:53,695
star trek what if i said that

530
00:17:53,695 --> 00:17:57,685
intentional centaurs but what if ah you

531
00:17:57,715 --> 00:17:59,365
could feel things when you're

532
00:17:59,425 --> 00:18:03,265
dead horrible and you're sitting there you're

533
00:18:03,355 --> 00:18:04,915
unable to move or communicate but you

534
00:18:04,915 --> 00:18:06,595
can feel things and then they're like

535
00:18:06,595 --> 00:18:07,555
now let's put you in the eight

536
00:18:07,555 --> 00:18:09,025
that's the that's not gonna happen that's

537
00:18:09,025 --> 00:18:10,525
the basis for a sci-fi thing that

538
00:18:10,525 --> 00:18:13,190
dead people can feel everything like there's

539
00:18:13,195 --> 00:18:15,595

of the bottle

691
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:49,730
it couldn't come out because there was

692
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:51,410
a stopper so i was a little

693
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:51,710

00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,830
if don't ask the question unless you

695
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:56,570
want it unless you're prepared to deal

696
00:23:56,570 --> 00:23:58,040
with the reality that answer i think

697
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:00,500
if you are only three given information

698
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,090
like that you should be curious and

699
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:05,510
say really i never got anywhere everyone

700
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:07,310

705
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:15,710

707
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:22,010

709
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:26,000

kind of stuff and they and it's

713
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:33,140
not they say it's not to

714
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:35,150
to judge the wine whether it's good

715
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:36,200
or bad it's just to see if

716
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,750

717
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:41,660

812
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:50,900
a attached swimmer to this pitch and

813
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:51,860

00:30:22,490 --> 00:30:24,080
let go and then it could be

895
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,400
a piece i wish my brain was

896
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,650
separate and i could leave it ajar

897
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,200
would just like to look at it

898
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,730

899
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:33,020

00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:17,870
it was a litter that detects ph

923
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:20,630
imbalances so if your cat is sick

924
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:22,280

925
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:24,380
to buy some cats well my cat

926
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:25,880

and we'll get back to shark tank

974
00:33:10,161 --> 00:33:11,180
in a minute but we don't have

975
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:13,820
another app that i saw recently was

976
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,520
was you know the person from flip-flop

977
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:19,580

00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:21,350
she always the divorce company else i

979
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:22,370
don't like about it it was the

980
00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:26,570
divorced couple you had terek or taraba

981
00:33:26,570 --> 00:33:28,010
yeah and she they got divorce

982
00:33:28,010 --> 00:33:29,900
first they still continue doing the show

983
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:31,760
or whatever me saw but so she's

984
00:33:31,790 --> 00:33:33,620
she won't get custody of flip delgado

985
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:34,220
shiplap

986
00:33:35,330 --> 00:33:36,920
but but so she's doing an ad

987
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:39,260
for showers or something right and he's

988
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:39,800
doing bad

989
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:43,970
but this is how the commercial starts

990
00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:45,590
she walks in and goes hi it's

991
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:46,550
kristina again

992
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,790
this is like my problem with curse

993
00:33:49,850 --> 00:33:51,410
this is my problem with curious george

994
00:33:51,410 --> 00:33:54,140
books what do you mean waiting again

995
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:56,750
setting up well yeah alright like we've

996
00:33:56,750 --> 00:33:59,180
never spoken also like on love is

997
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:01,220
blind she goes i'm an esl ah

998
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:03,530
ha obviously i'm nicholas j and you

999
00:34:03,530 --> 00:34:06,470
just go obvious obviously i'm nicholas shade

1000
00:34:06,470 --> 00:34:07,850
that's bold it's

1001
00:34:07,850 --> 00:34:10,340
just like well that obviously she's been

1002
00:34:10,370 --> 00:34:11,750
a son obviously this is love is

1003
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:13,730
blind and obviously i just wasn't like

1004
00:34:14,090 --> 00:34:15,500
that's so but it seemed to me

1005
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:18,080
like it was the it wasn't hurt

1006
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:19,460
doing it it was the producer of

1007
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:21,230
the commercial kind of wanting to be

1008
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:24,080
like yeah sure you're always talking to

1009
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:26,240
her right it's just another example of

1010
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:27,950
this she's always i guess

1011
00:34:28,010 --> 00:34:30,170
writing us into thinking that like she's

1012
00:34:30,170 --> 00:34:31,790
always around or something i don't know

1013
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,260
it was very strange very odd hi

1014
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:34,760
it's kristina again here's what else i

1015
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,200
don't like about shark okay and i've

1016
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:38,120
just realised this now the fact that

1017
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:40,242
it's on video makes it somehow worse

1018
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,350
mean on video was like on film

1019
00:34:42,350 --> 00:34:45,350
like newhart yeah or like top chef

1020
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:46,910
for you know like shows like that

1021
00:34:46,910 --> 00:34:47,810
like there's a lot of them that

1022
00:34:47,810 --> 00:34:48,170
are kind of

1023
00:34:48,170 --> 00:34:50,000
of finish you know it's like a

1024
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,940
stage presentation yeah there's it's like to

1025
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:55,430
live feeling it's too like yeah i

1026
00:34:55,430 --> 00:34:57,380
don't i don't like it i don't

1027
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:59,150
like shark tank okay i think i

1028
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:01,100
get i don't like watching the presentations

1029
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:02,630
of these dumb people the worst part

1030
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:03,410
of it is is you have a

1031
00:35:03,410 --> 00:35:05,390
million dollar idea and you yeah i

1032
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:06,980
want to go on but yeah you

1033
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:08,330
hate the shows and you think

1034
00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:09,560
eating all your own money into it

1035
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:11,810
yeah and your ideas why a tank

1036
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:14,900
for sharks yeah so plus rails

1037
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,420
i see pie chart

1038
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,310
so your ideas what a giant tank

1039
00:35:22,310 --> 00:35:24,890
for all these sharks yeah sometimes i

1040
00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:26,540
find interesting when they go off on

1041
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:29,960
somebody or like sometimes they'll be like

1042
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,760
really though like like let's say for

1043
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:34,880
instance like the person challenges the offer

1044
00:35:34,910 --> 00:35:36,770
yeah yeah sometimes they allow them to

1045
00:35:36,770 --> 00:35:37,970
do that but other times they go

1046
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:38,604
you're gonna of

1047
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:40,430
well what because when they when they

1048
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:42,350
don't allow it there's so condescending to

1049
00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:44,750
the people and it's like i this

1050
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:46,783
is a really like your idea is

1051
00:35:46,783 --> 00:35:48,530
so stupid and here we are offering

1052
00:35:48,530 --> 00:35:51,110
you money for your yeah counteracting yea

1053
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:52,730
i'm like don't they have the right

1054
00:35:52,730 --> 00:35:54,140
to be like i'd rather give you

1055
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:56,000
twenty five percent and thirty three percent

1056
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,620
or whatever and like yeah the shark

1057
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:58,970
is like no

1058
00:35:58,970 --> 00:36:01,190
no no and it's like or that

1059
00:36:01,204 --> 00:36:02,630
i'm not interested or like there'll be

1060
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:04,490
like the persons challenging it and then

1061
00:36:04,490 --> 00:36:06,230
like the other sharks were already out

1062
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:07,820
or you shouldn't be doing that you

1063
00:36:07,850 --> 00:36:09,770
shouldn't be you should they should let

1064
00:36:09,770 --> 00:36:10,730
us be judged but you know what

1065
00:36:10,730 --> 00:36:11,570
else it's like i want to be

1066
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:12,890
sure there's a thing where so the

1067
00:36:12,890 --> 00:36:15,140
person gives her presentation like yeah but

1068
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:16,640
ah who wants this why do they

1069
00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:18,140
you know who cares what it's like

1070
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,130
well why is this purse

1071
00:36:19,130 --> 00:36:20,690
being on the show like i don't

1072
00:36:20,690 --> 00:36:23,210
want this is unpleasant to watch i

1073
00:36:23,210 --> 00:36:24,890
already find it pleasant so usually you

1074
00:36:24,890 --> 00:36:26,780
don't like like american idol when they

1075
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:28,190
would have bad singers on they would

1076
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:30,020
i hated that yeah well that was

1077
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:31,580
the only reason anyone watched that was

1078
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:33,860
a different time i feel where there

1079
00:36:33,863 --> 00:36:35,300
was a different time i don't feel

1080
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:37,310
that we as a culture want to

1081
00:36:37,310 --> 00:36:38,780
do that the same way we did

1082
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:39,290
twenty years

1083
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:41,570
ago where it was like funny now

1084
00:36:41,570 --> 00:36:43,001
i feel like it's really known and

1085
00:36:43,001 --> 00:36:44,540
they still do it the notional veda

1086
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:46,490
american idols have feel good show now

1087
00:36:46,490 --> 00:36:47,930
where everyone who comes on has like

1088
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,910
the inspirational story i feel we've gone

1089
00:36:49,910 --> 00:36:51,290
so far on the other side that

1090
00:36:51,290 --> 00:36:52,730
it would be fresh again to have

1091
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:55,730
a simon being like you saw the

1092
00:36:55,730 --> 00:36:58,370
last shark tank i saw is money

1093
00:36:59,690 --> 00:37:02,300
he's good you used to suck

1094
00:37:03,770 --> 00:37:04,220
into the

1095
00:37:05,870 --> 00:37:07,864
come out and say like oh yeah

1096
00:37:07,995 --> 00:37:09,950
you heard all the king terror book

1097
00:37:10,010 --> 00:37:11,330
and they would sometimes be like what

1098
00:37:11,330 --> 00:37:12,590
are we even doing here and get

1099
00:37:12,590 --> 00:37:14,750
mad at the producers like this because

1100
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:17,000
the producers are intentionally saying yeah yes

1101
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,500

your clinic now he's gonna hate that

1106
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:30,830
we watched some shark tank in a

1107
00:37:30,890 --> 00:37:33,530
hotel room and um there was this

1108
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:35,120

1109
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:37,640
watching a hotel rooms just waiting to

1110
00:37:37,970 --> 00:37:39,590
go to hell to watch their tv

1111
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:41,900
we went on to check the hotel

1112
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:42,530
to watch it

1113
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:44,720
um ah

1114
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:48,350
learn dropped an orange it's amanda um

1115
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:49,700
i don't care

1116
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:54,140
so so this woman it was two

1117
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:56,750
women that had this um this ah

1118
00:37:56,900 --> 00:38:00,350
new ah baby changing station like the

1119
00:38:00,350 --> 00:38:02,330
kind you have like public restroom yes

1120
00:38:02,330 --> 00:38:04,250
exactly and the idea was that this

1121
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:07,190
was a self cleaning station so after

1122
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:08,930
you install in restrooms or that you

1123
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,400
would one would bring no no

1124
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:13,190
installed in restrooms and you you know

1125
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:14,930
you close the lid before you use

1126
00:38:14,930 --> 00:38:16,340
it and then it was china charges

1127
00:38:16,342 --> 00:38:18,050
the thing and it was great idea

1128
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:19,400
but and they pointed out

1129
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:22,310
yeah but you're not going to be

1130
00:38:22,310 --> 00:38:24,350
able to get the people that need

1131
00:38:24,350 --> 00:38:25,820
to buy it to buy it like

1132
00:38:25,850 --> 00:38:27,410
for for the for the people that

1133
00:38:27,410 --> 00:38:29,690
would use it like a lot is

1134
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:31,700
yes but the bud for like an

1135
00:38:31,730 --> 00:38:33,890
airport or a restaurant or a mall

1136
00:38:33,890 --> 00:38:35,750
or whatever it's too expensive it's too

1137
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:37,100
expensive so they're not going to buy

1138
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:40,400
it right and that was interesting at

1139
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:40,730

1140
00:38:40,730 --> 00:38:43,700

la law because i'd never seen any

um i find a dell twenty fascinating

1258
00:43:10,665 --> 00:43:13,715
the corbin bernstein pale because it was

1259
00:43:13,715 --> 00:43:15,305
really good in a pilot for him

1260
00:43:15,305 --> 00:43:16,895
to do be a divorce lawyer and

1261
00:43:16,895 --> 00:43:19,055
they got to do like cd knees

1262
00:43:19,055 --> 00:43:20,585
giving terrible advice and all that and

1263
00:43:20,585 --> 00:43:22,175
then they ran out of storylines i

1264
00:43:22,175 --> 00:43:23,675
think three episodes in of him being

1265
00:43:23,675 --> 00:43:24,965
a divorce lawyer so they turned him

1266
00:43:24,965 --> 00:43:25,565
into an effort

1267
00:43:25,655 --> 00:43:25,955

let's do it oh they have to

1347
00:46:21,035 --> 00:46:22,325
because john smith i don't think is

1348
00:46:22,325 --> 00:46:25,235
a memorable name unless you're it's a

1349
00:46:25,235 --> 00:46:27,905
fucking example dude named that and then

1350
00:46:27,905 --> 00:46:28,595
it is

1351
00:46:29,765 --> 00:46:31,145
if you met somebody named john smith

1352
00:46:31,145 --> 00:46:32,375
you would not forget it because the

1353
00:46:32,375 --> 00:46:34,745

00:46:34,745 --> 00:46:37,355
any john smith ah apologies to most

1355
00:46:37,355 --> 00:46:39,515

some of them gotta be dicks right

1357
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:46,115

you know like every when people come

1359
00:46:48,125 --> 00:46:49,475

crazy name you know and so i

1361
00:46:51,305 --> 00:46:53,495
picked jim smith to be the care

1362
00:46:53,495 --> 00:46:55,625
but then his name is actually gymnasiums

1363
00:46:55,775 --> 00:46:58,655
and it's smithsonian because he was born

1364
00:46:58,655 --> 00:47:00,995
into bayesian in the smithsonian did that

1365
00:47:00,995 --> 00:47:02,315

your little devil i don't know alright

but ah alright the forgotten character then

1369
00:47:08,645 --> 00:47:10,385
