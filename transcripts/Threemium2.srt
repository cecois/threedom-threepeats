very loud

71
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:51,180
it seems like a bad thing to

72
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,560
be just forget i remember hearing the

73
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,150
story of how they ended up there

74
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:56,310
ah but they are there's this big

75
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:58,470
flock of of ah green pairs i

76
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:00,630
think telegraph hills were the angle but

77
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:02,130
i saw them in a tree and

78
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:03,660
they kept doing the same thing over

79
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:05,460
and over again where there they make

80
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:08,790
like a terrific tran leaf oh sorry

81
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:09,000
good

82
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:12,810
so they send the tree and they're

83
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:14,790
all talking to each other than they

84
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:18,300
all fuckin take off they fly like

85
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,480
you know a few yards away then

86
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:24,300
they swoop down and fly back as

87
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,370
a group the whole time back into

88
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:28,800
the tree and they're all chattering with

89
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,240
each other and they

90
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,650
just repeat this like over and over

91
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:34,530
again there's like some parrots on the

92
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:36,900
east side yeah ballet that are supposedly

93
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:39,420
a pet store burned down i think

94
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:40,980
that's i think that's urban legend it

95
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:42,420
sounds like yeah but we used to

96
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:43,590
get those parents in our neighborhood they

97
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:44,820
don't come anymore and it really bums

98
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:45,810
me out i loved it it sounds

99
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:47,430
like drastic park but yeah like the

100
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:48,738
the urban legend said a pet store

101
00:03:48,738 --> 00:03:50,250
stubborn none of the parents were displaced

102
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:50,359
and

103
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,350
and they now are wild but it

104
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:54,390
is weird that they're there yeah that's

105
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:55,379
why we have so many goldfish all

106
00:03:55,379 --> 00:03:55,980
over the place

107
00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:01,410

00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,970
of those decomposing videos but in real

135
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:02,190

00:06:58,593 --> 00:07:00,390
true when you treat something what does

195
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:01,800
it mean it means you force them
