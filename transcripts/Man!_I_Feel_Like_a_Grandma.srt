of it as healthy

29
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,510

00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:15,630
make it at home is healthy you

32

know honestly if the seats are so

33
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:18,690
important to your health because if you're

34
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:19,830
sitting there in burger king and you're

35
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:21,900

40
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,040
you saying it right yeah the burger

41
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,020
king chairs are so uncomfortable because he

42
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:35,460
when they wanna remind you that you're

43
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:37,020
not the king you're a peasant you're

44
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:38,370
a peasant you're a bigger person here

45
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:39,870
is that here in the burger kingdom

46
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:41,640

00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,660
of burger king the one thing they

48
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:44,250
think is the seats are not comfortable

49

and yes and yeah sure i mean

50
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,160

course yeah but yeah the hot dog

156
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:20,910
and i had a smoker and a

157
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:21,390
hotdog

158
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:24,570

160
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:29,880
happened and then we all separately went

161
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:32,250
to the bathroom i hadn't gone yet

162
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,785
so you you're clutching your side

163
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:37,557
you're touching your phone you look like

164
00:05:37,557 --> 00:05:40,230
you have happened to me i feel

165
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:43,530
good yeah i like doing this that

166
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:46,530
was a coincidence but my so doesn't

167
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:48,360
feel perfect i'll say it doesn't feel

168
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,980
right it's not just like chill and

169
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:51,120
how it was before we ate the

170
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,500
food it hasn't hit me yet but

171
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,932
i also eat very fast so ah

172
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,550
there's the food has not yet reached

173
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:59,040
my guts so if you eat super

174
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,840
fast right it slows down right that's

175
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:01,980
the bottom line is that your theory

176
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:06,210
i yes my theory is super fast

177
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:06,720
furious

178
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:08,370
so the food will slow down as

179
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:10,050
it goes down food the food doesn't

180
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:10,620
know where to go

181
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:14,490

329
00:11:44,465 --> 00:11:46,115
period at the end of this sentence

330
00:11:46,175 --> 00:11:47,315
and it'll be like you'll be reported

331
00:11:47,315 --> 00:11:48,271
on the news like children

332
00:11:48,395 --> 00:11:50,885

00:11:50,885 --> 00:11:52,745
to not get coven has gotten covert

334
00:11:52,955 --> 00:11:55,265
and overt know i know i'm meeting

335
00:11:55,265 --> 00:11:56,435
no one ever gets it after me

336
00:11:56,975 --> 00:11:57,875
yeah that's why i said it's over

337
00:11:57,875 --> 00:11:59,580
man oh i see as i said

338
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:01,085
superman i did i was saying i

339
00:12:01,085 --> 00:12:02,045
didn't want to be the last person

340
00:12:02,045 --> 00:12:03,695
to ever get covert and i know

341
00:12:03,695 --> 00:12:04,925
you want it to be the last

342
00:12:04,925 --> 00:12:06,395
person to ever yeah there can be

343
00:12:06,395 --> 00:12:08,075
other people out there who never gotten

344
00:12:08,075 --> 00:12:08,555
comin own

345
00:12:08,555 --> 00:12:10,055
only way that's gonna happen is your

346
00:12:10,055 --> 00:12:11,372
the very last person to get it

347
00:12:11,435 --> 00:12:13,235
you're probably right i know it

348
00:12:14,555 --> 00:12:16,402
you're probably right that's i think when

349
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:17,915
the last person to get it

350
00:12:18,005 --> 00:12:20,465
and then that was it the animals

351
00:12:20,465 --> 00:12:22,925
would like take over instead of i

352
00:12:22,925 --> 00:12:24,245
think they would bow down to me

353
00:12:24,365 --> 00:12:26,225
to be like that movie thirty monkeys

354
00:12:26,285 --> 00:12:28,205
all creatures great and small would come

355
00:12:28,205 --> 00:12:30,035
to me and bow before their master

356
00:12:30,305 --> 00:12:31,685
like what's one would you want to

357
00:12:31,685 --> 00:12:33,605
do it first which one would i

358
00:12:33,605 --> 00:12:36,815
want to bow first problem yoke why

359
00:12:36,815 --> 00:12:38,045
the ilk because there's

360
00:12:38,105 --> 00:12:39,755
horns and everything would be so funny

361
00:12:39,785 --> 00:12:41,135
it would be like check those out

362
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:44,465
an elephant this huge creature bowing to

363
00:12:44,465 --> 00:12:45,815
you he's gonna be in the back

364
00:12:45,815 --> 00:12:47,855
so we he's gonna block everyone he's

365
00:12:47,855 --> 00:12:49,685
gonna block the field mice and everything

366
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:51,485
if he's in the frog they're fucked

367
00:12:51,485 --> 00:12:53,675

368
00:12:53,675 --> 00:12:55,175
elk como okay i want this guy

what to think okay this is paul's

what to think and you're going to

442
00:15:17,045 --> 00:15:18,485
take our temperature on what we thought

443
00:15:18,485 --> 00:15:20,825
about whatever your your your thing is

444
00:15:20,915 --> 00:15:23,135
you know what you think yeah okay

445
00:15:23,375 --> 00:15:26,735
what you think about curtain calls because

446
00:15:26,735 --> 00:15:28,955
recently a friend of mine

447
00:15:28,955 --> 00:15:30,815
fine we were having dinner and he

448
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:32,615
went to see a play and before

449
00:15:32,615 --> 00:15:34,685
he went to see the play a

450
00:15:34,685 --> 00:15:37,955
friend of his said art curtain calls

451
00:15:37,955 --> 00:15:39,695
weird like when you actually look at

452
00:15:39,695 --> 00:15:42,125
it isn't it a strange thing that

453
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:43,325
the play is over and then the

454
00:15:43,325 --> 00:15:45,665
people come back out and i was

455
00:15:45,665 --> 00:15:47,255
like i get that should do it

456
00:15:47,255 --> 00:15:48,005
in movies

457
00:15:49,985 --> 00:15:51,754
brad pitt and sandra bullock and damn

458
00:15:51,754 --> 00:15:53,435
i'm just bough why i want them

459
00:15:53,435 --> 00:15:55,625
away as other cares well that's the

460
00:15:55,625 --> 00:15:57,995
thing it's i don't think it's weird

461
00:15:58,265 --> 00:15:59,705
yeah like i like it as the

462
00:15:59,705 --> 00:16:01,145
tradition of the theater i think an

463
00:16:01,145 --> 00:16:04,715
audience would would be stymied and would

464
00:16:04,745 --> 00:16:07,595
would feel unsatisfied having not being able

465
00:16:07,595 --> 00:16:09,275
to thank yeah these people lie

466
00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:10,655
i think that we're so used to

467
00:16:10,655 --> 00:16:12,305
it that it would be very strange

468
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:13,985
if it wasn't there yeah but this

469
00:16:13,985 --> 00:16:16,475
person's point was if the thing is

470
00:16:16,505 --> 00:16:17,645
over why do you why do you

471
00:16:17,645 --> 00:16:20,075
go through this this moral rigmarole or

472
00:16:20,075 --> 00:16:22,475
whatever um i will say this though

473
00:16:22,715 --> 00:16:26,015
that the individual curtain calls i think

474
00:16:26,105 --> 00:16:28,085
don't need to happen meaning wherever i'm

475
00:16:28,085 --> 00:16:29,435
coming out separately everyone

476
00:16:29,435 --> 00:16:30,875
and getting around somebody somebody gets more

477
00:16:30,935 --> 00:16:31,805
clauses really

478
00:16:33,065 --> 00:16:35,915
i still think it's ok i think

479
00:16:35,915 --> 00:16:38,645
it's nice to slap for the people

480
00:16:38,645 --> 00:16:40,595
and have them feel that energy i

481
00:16:40,595 --> 00:16:41,492
do too and i think if anything

482
00:16:41,492 --> 00:16:42,725
come out one by one that's also

483
00:16:42,725 --> 00:16:44,045
nice because i get that moment that

484
00:16:44,045 --> 00:16:45,635
excitement but it it it tends to

485
00:16:45,635 --> 00:16:47,555
be a combination like how it builds

486
00:16:47,555 --> 00:16:49,505
like oh the person with the least

487
00:16:49,505 --> 00:16:51,005
part comes out first and well you

488
00:16:51,005 --> 00:16:52,505
know what i you always you always

489
00:16:52,505 --> 00:16:53,195
know who is

490
00:16:53,195 --> 00:16:53,975
is going to get the most of

491
00:16:53,975 --> 00:16:55,325
what what what i used to hate

492
00:16:55,715 --> 00:16:57,815
that yeah so then take away from

493
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:00,005
seeing shows that though just had that

494
00:17:00,005 --> 00:17:01,200
one person come out but it's also

495
00:17:01,295 --> 00:17:03,005
a collaborative school will get you in

496
00:17:03,005 --> 00:17:05,435
a second it's also a collaborative art

497
00:17:05,435 --> 00:17:06,935
form so i think everybody should bow

498
00:17:06,935 --> 00:17:08,705
at the same time yeah i do

499
00:17:08,735 --> 00:17:10,745
think approximately the same to me like

500
00:17:10,745 --> 00:17:12,695
the idea of you're seeing these people

501
00:17:12,695 --> 00:17:13,355
do this in ff

502
00:17:13,355 --> 00:17:14,285
front of you they've worked on it

503
00:17:14,285 --> 00:17:15,995
for a long time and they're actually

504
00:17:15,995 --> 00:17:17,915
there that i think that's a great

505
00:17:17,915 --> 00:17:20,105
moment to have the curtain call between

506
00:17:20,135 --> 00:17:21,665
you know the performers and the audience

507
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:22,685
what have we did a curtain call

508
00:17:22,685 --> 00:17:25,385
after these we have been nobody knows

509
00:17:25,835 --> 00:17:28,715
i always bow after every podcast they

510
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:31,865
do things like leave the zoom and

511
00:17:31,865 --> 00:17:33,455
then i back to your

512
00:17:33,515 --> 00:17:35,735
computer yeah well i when i used

513
00:17:35,735 --> 00:17:36,875
to see shows at the la mirada

514
00:17:36,875 --> 00:17:39,185
playhouse they would always to get people

515
00:17:39,185 --> 00:17:40,685
to come to them because you know

516
00:17:40,685 --> 00:17:42,725
la mirada california is not like a

517
00:17:42,755 --> 00:17:45,095
cultural yeah you ever go there um

518
00:17:45,125 --> 00:17:46,055
to get people to go to them

519
00:17:46,055 --> 00:17:48,095
they would cast like one famous person

520
00:17:48,665 --> 00:17:51,035
and i remember seeing ted launch as

521
00:17:51,425 --> 00:17:53,675
isaac your bartender yes as ah

522
00:17:53,765 --> 00:17:56,765
the drill instructor in biloxi blues neil

523
00:17:56,765 --> 00:17:59,555
simon's play that matthew broderick ah did

524
00:17:59,585 --> 00:18:01,655
fantasy broadway did he do the play

525
00:18:01,685 --> 00:18:03,005
or the movie i can't remember too

526
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:04,925
he did the movie okay so wait

527
00:18:04,925 --> 00:18:06,245
did he i don't think so i

528
00:18:06,245 --> 00:18:07,685
think he was replaced for that one

529
00:18:07,685 --> 00:18:09,456
and the superman did we yeah yeah

530
00:18:09,456 --> 00:18:11,165
i think silberman didn't like the single

531
00:18:11,165 --> 00:18:13,715
guy silberman from your girl schedules yeah

532
00:18:13,925 --> 00:18:16,985
little partner in crime so the issue

533
00:18:16,985 --> 00:18:18,635
for me is when ted launch who

534
00:18:18,635 --> 00:18:21,605
has a a showy part but a

535
00:18:21,635 --> 00:18:25,205
supporting role these these kids and especially

536
00:18:25,205 --> 00:18:27,395
the guy playing matthew broderick's role are

537
00:18:27,395 --> 00:18:29,435
the are the backbone of this show

538
00:18:29,465 --> 00:18:31,715
yes but then ted launch because he's

539
00:18:31,715 --> 00:18:33,995
the biggest star is that the pronunciation

540
00:18:34,025 --> 00:18:34,925
maybe huh

541
00:18:35,585 --> 00:18:38,135
ten launch l a n g he

542
00:18:38,165 --> 00:18:40,415
gets the last bow and everyone and

543
00:18:40,415 --> 00:18:42,155
he gets the most applause and it's

544
00:18:42,185 --> 00:18:44,465
all because of fame yeah fuck that

545
00:18:44,495 --> 00:18:45,935
if i were an and i and

546
00:18:45,935 --> 00:18:46,925
i saw it and i was like

547
00:18:46,925 --> 00:18:48,395
ten launch i don't respect you anymore

548
00:18:48,395 --> 00:18:50,435
because if i was dead launch i

549
00:18:50,435 --> 00:18:52,925
would be saying let the let these

550
00:18:52,925 --> 00:18:55,025

551
00:18:55,025 --> 00:18:55,595

900
00:31:21,850 --> 00:31:24,129
mean she was equally interested yeah like

901
00:31:24,183 --> 00:31:25,840
we maybe had fun together and stuff

902
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:27,370
well i'm not saying that you'd have

903
00:31:27,370 --> 00:31:28,570
fun together because i'm just saying the

904
00:31:28,570 --> 00:31:30,070
opportunities but it might not be fun

905
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:30,640
yeah

906
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:33,340
um i would probably try it but

907
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:34,690
i think i would know enough that

908
00:31:34,690 --> 00:31:36,670
that it wasn't a match yeah yeah

909
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:38,200
but i'm not i wouldn't close the

910
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,060

she'd be equally interested in all my

917
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:50,860
podcasts

918
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:54,610
yeah like equally uninterested yeah right as

919
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,320
uninterested as i am in her music

920
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,970
yeah there you go oh easily i
