41
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:39,750
you have to let it go and

42
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:40,530
you have to never do that again

43
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,940

44
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:44,220

64
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,670

70
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:34,048

71
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:35,610

72
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:36,090
lord

73
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,880
but i and this is this is

74
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,320
you know the territory of why don't

00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:20,250
which i'm really glad we did because

189
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:22,860
we holly loved it she oh she

190
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:24,420
was crash she had a great time

191
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:27,210
i could hear her laughing from the

192
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:28,761
room that i was still having a

193
00:06:28,761 --> 00:06:31,410
lot of fun um but we got

194
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:33,150
there and and did they say if

195
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:34,740
you had been sixty seconds later you

196
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:35,880
would have lost your hand what can

197
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,500
i say actually it sounds a little

198
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,440
extreme but my finger was blue oh

199
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:43,020
and then they were like it's tied

200
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:44,263
too tight which we of course they

201
00:06:44,263 --> 00:06:45,450
always say do it so tight

202
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,630
yeah strike me yeah but then they

203
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:50,100
were concerned she literally was like if

204
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:50,880
you left i mean i don't know

205
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,780
how long it would have to be

206
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:52,530
but she was like if you left

207
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:53,430
it like this you could have lost

208
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:55,140
your finger oh and like maybe if

209
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:56,250
i wasn't smart enough to go to

210
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:57,300
the urgent care i would like gone

211
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,770
to sleep or you know who know

212
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:00,031
but i was really terrified of that

213
00:07:00,031 --> 00:07:00,960
so that's a good tip for anyone

214
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,370
out there don't go too tight but

215
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:03,240
i thought he was doing right i

216
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,560
mean we both felt very yeah you're

217
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,760
sound like it was probably

218
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:08,309
to cut off the yeah yeah it

219
00:07:08,309 --> 00:07:10,080
was bleeding so much i'm so crazy

220
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,850
so it made sense but anyway it

221
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:14,550
was too tight which finger my index

222
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:15,960
fingers right here if it had been

223
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,280
your thumb you have a major artery

224
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,200
and your thumb is that true no

225
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:23,190
anyway so the i didn't ever look

226
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:26,100
at it and they the woman doctor

227
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,120
came in and doctor was a woman

228
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:28,620
what's bizarre

229
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:30,630
most shocking part of the story she

230
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:32,010
could operate on you because you're not

231
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:35,130
related exactly yeah and she stitched it

232
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:37,350
up i got three stitches and i

233
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:39,540
could feel it at a certain point

234
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:41,040
the light cane was wearing off in

235
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:41,940
one part of my hand and i

236
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:44,310
was like oh she's like are you

237
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:45,540
feel that and i was like yeah

238
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:46,320
and then she tried give me a

239
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,850
shot and i still felt it but

240
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:48,960
i will say having your whole

241
00:07:48,967 --> 00:07:50,490
vagina sewn up does put things into

242
00:07:50,502 --> 00:07:51,120
perspective

243
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:55,200
an abrupt subject change

244
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:58,770
and you had that as to not

245
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:00,210

the first thing that comes to mind

310
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:52,590
is when i was a bachelor and

311
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:54,960

00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,190
yeah right oh no

373
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:01,790
i was just balancing myself and then

374
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:06,230
i started to fall no and i

375
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,980
lit i i jerked my hand up

376
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:13,790
and it totally opened my finger oh

377
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:16,880
my god and so that was definitely

378
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:17,870
a drug to warn you i made

379
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:18,080
these

380
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,470
that's horrible yeah that was a bad

381
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:24,650
one ah so bad why your sweatshirt

382
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:26,428
says twenty four it says eight twenty

383
00:12:26,428 --> 00:12:28,040
twentieth so h when i got there

384
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,480
i don't know what i'd worry about

385
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:31,310
production company company because i know a

386
00:12:31,325 --> 00:12:32,951
twenty four is a production company but

387
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,700
it is something they make like movies

388
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:37,130
and stuff it's jack bauer hwy twenty

389
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:39,020
four big hit because it's it's a

390
00:12:39,037 --> 00:12:39,260
twenty

391
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:41,870
for big head we should always just

392
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:43,610
parodies of these yeah cause everyone will

393
00:12:43,612 --> 00:12:46,550
get that yes it's a basic switch

394
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:48,350
when eight twenty four gives them out

395
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,360
for yes we ever also give them

396
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,770
to a twenty two the same people

397
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,120
yes yeah let's spend all of our

398
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,190
own money doing that absolutely

399
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:58,700
i think the trickiest part is getting

400
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:00,650
a twenty four to share their contact

401
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:03,380

so billy joel's the strangler um do

664
00:21:32,605 --> 00:21:36,055
you think that anyone made coasters featuring

665
00:21:36,445 --> 00:21:37,435
the coasters

666
00:21:38,125 --> 00:21:39,235
i don't think so that would be

667
00:21:39,235 --> 00:21:42,295
so disrespectful to them and i think

668
00:21:42,295 --> 00:21:43,825
someone should do it now by the

669
00:21:43,825 --> 00:21:45,295
way we're okay so here's a question

670
00:21:45,295 --> 00:21:47,065
that can also yeah what what why

671
00:21:47,065 --> 00:21:48,625
did they call the coasters that's what

672
00:21:48,625 --> 00:21:50,215
i mean in our day the roller

673
00:21:50,215 --> 00:21:52,105
coasters are they the coasters you put

674
00:21:52,105 --> 00:21:53,635
a glass on it's less cool if

675
00:21:53,635 --> 00:21:55,165
they're the coasters you political are they

676
00:21:55,165 --> 00:21:56,755
just people that little i don't post

677
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:58,135

678
00:21:58,165 --> 00:22:00,475
who coast through life that's less cool

679
00:22:00,475 --> 00:22:01,977
to me to know i think it's

680
00:22:02,331 --> 00:22:04,645
cool like roller coasters or drink coast

681
00:22:04,675 --> 00:22:06,355
i think that i think they must

682
00:22:06,355 --> 00:22:08,275
be the coasters like the like the

683
00:22:08,455 --> 00:22:09,715
the roller but let's look them up

684
00:22:09,715 --> 00:22:11,815
what do you say sure i have

685
00:22:11,815 --> 00:22:13,495
nothing else to fucking do yeah i

686
00:22:13,495 --> 00:22:15,215
don't care i don't care

687
00:22:16,435 --> 00:22:19,225

688
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:21,325
i may have done premium blend twice

00:22:23,665 --> 00:22:25,615
i'm not chased to watch it okay

692
00:22:25,645 --> 00:22:28,255
i did remember a list oh wait

693
00:22:28,255 --> 00:22:30,295
what's that that was that was where

694
00:22:30,475 --> 00:22:32,485
like before they were doing those comedy

695
00:22:32,485 --> 00:22:34,555
half hours that was like long it

696
00:22:34,555 --> 00:22:36,445
was still a bunch of comedians but

697
00:22:36,445 --> 00:22:36,535
it

698
00:22:36,608 --> 00:22:38,755
be longer sets i think ah huh

699
00:22:38,845 --> 00:22:40,345
it would be like three comedians instead

700
00:22:40,345 --> 00:22:42,355
of six or something like that like

701
00:22:42,355 --> 00:22:44,575
imagine a tiny penis and then imagine

702
00:22:44,575 --> 00:22:46,285
a big penis i can't and it's

703
00:22:46,315 --> 00:22:48,445
in their friends yeah i can't say

704
00:22:48,445 --> 00:22:49,405

705
00:22:49,615 --> 00:22:50,995
none of the ones that we know

706
00:22:50,995 --> 00:22:52,855

how was your christmas my christmas was

985
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:17,330

having an injection and then there will

987
00:32:19,130 --> 00:32:20,690

00:32:29,930 --> 00:32:30,650
in my rear

992
00:32:31,730 --> 00:32:32,150

00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:32,780
up here

994
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:39,560

00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:40,610
the sea like what if in willy

996
00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:44,630
wonka instead of dream this harmony thing

997
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:45,680
is like you got you need an

998
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:46,160
injection

999
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:50,720

00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,100
scenes on ejection

1001
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:58,700

beef injection they call an objection yeah

1318
00:43:46,965 --> 00:43:48,674
legendary thing when we were kids that

1319
00:43:48,674 --> 00:43:50,445
was like this cartoon was like rated

1320
00:43:50,445 --> 00:43:52,875
x it was rated movie yeah that's

1321
00:43:52,875 --> 00:43:56,295
so that's so nineties yeah that's so

1322
00:43:56,295 --> 00:43:57,915
nineties although this was the eighties but

1323
00:43:57,915 --> 00:43:59,685
people don't say anything is rated x

1324
00:43:59,685 --> 00:44:01,275
now you just go

1325
00:44:01,365 --> 00:44:03,195
it just is no yeah do you

1326
00:44:03,195 --> 00:44:04,635
remember finding out the triple x is

1327
00:44:04,665 --> 00:44:06,568
meaningless like there's no yeah there's there's

1328
00:44:06,585 --> 00:44:08,805
no there there well there's there should

1329
00:44:08,805 --> 00:44:10,665
be a double x this is so

1330
00:44:10,665 --> 00:44:13,275
filthy because there are no movies that

1331
00:44:13,275 --> 00:44:15,315
are double x so that that's a

1332
00:44:15,315 --> 00:44:16,875
real like hole in the market that

1333
00:44:16,875 --> 00:44:18,045

a csv type show before the opening

1347
00:44:49,815 --> 00:44:52,815

murder was committed and what the clues

1359
00:45:15,735 --> 00:45:18,555
are and once enough exposition has been

1360
00:45:18,555 --> 00:45:21,075
given the lead detective then tries to

1361
00:45:21,075 --> 00:45:22,556
cap off the scene with one a

1362
00:45:22,556 --> 00:45:23,505
one line quip

1363
00:45:23,625 --> 00:45:25,095

00:48:32,685 --> 00:48:33,915
a rubber chicken and it was just

1464
00:48:34,098 --> 00:48:35,025
like two hundred

1465
00:48:35,145 --> 00:48:36,735
yeah oh yeah no i get it

1466
00:48:37,005 --> 00:48:39,285
retrospect call attention to data okay buh

1467
00:48:39,311 --> 00:48:41,055
that was the worst part um

1468
00:48:41,865 --> 00:48:43,305
yeah i'm just talking what here first

1469
00:48:43,305 --> 00:48:44,655
of all you're much taller than i

1470
00:48:44,655 --> 00:48:46,365
thought you look so small on instagram

1471
00:48:46,635 --> 00:48:47,895
i know well what i do is

1472
00:48:47,895 --> 00:48:49,245
i put i put the camera really

1473
00:48:49,245 --> 00:48:51,825
far away okay so yeah i'm retract

1474
00:48:51,851 --> 00:48:53,895

close to the camera got it okay

1478
00:49:00,075 --> 00:49:01,695

00:49:04,695 --> 00:49:06,975
the place and anyone who is not

00:49:14,085 --> 00:49:16,155
yeah um okay well we haven't put

1488
00:49:16,155 --> 00:49:18,075

00:49:18,075 --> 00:49:21,165
is this fifty people were murdered this

1490
00:49:21,165 --> 00:49:22,185

eighty where a mermaid performer was crawling

1492
00:49:26,595 --> 00:49:28,395
out from the ocean this is kind

1493
00:49:28,395 --> 00:49:30,045
of standard obviously we're on the beach

1494
00:49:30,045 --> 00:49:32,535
right um yeah obviously she crawled up

1495
00:49:32,535 --> 00:49:33,975
from the ocean called up from the

1496
00:49:33,975 --> 00:49:37,065
ocean performance she was it was supposed

1497
00:49:37,065 --> 00:49:38,145
to be like she was supposed to

1498
00:49:38,145 --> 00:49:40,755

couldn't get her legs off yeah and

1502
00:49:47,175 --> 00:49:49,485

around and that's all we have we've

1505
00:49:53,925 --> 00:49:56,445

1506
00:49:56,445 --> 00:49:58,965
dead and and we have this eyewitness

1507
00:49:58,965 --> 00:50:00,645
account of the mermaid the mermaid still

1508
00:50:00,645 --> 00:50:02,115
with she's here she's so alive

1509
00:50:02,685 --> 00:50:03,765
and she told us up to that

1510
00:50:03,765 --> 00:50:04,665
and we said a whole lot just

1511
00:50:04,665 --> 00:50:06,405
stop i know just stop right there

1512
00:50:06,495 --> 00:50:08,505

1513
00:50:08,505 --> 00:50:10,245
already i said i'm like yeah i

1514
00:50:10,245 --> 00:50:13,065
said obviously every every person who's dead

1515
00:50:13,065 --> 00:50:15,735
you can see the obvious clues here

1516
00:50:15,735 --> 00:50:18,645
there's the each person is holding a

1517
00:50:18,735 --> 00:50:21,855
a cracker for the crabs to yeah

1518
00:50:22,245 --> 00:50:22,437
and

1519
00:50:22,665 --> 00:50:24,495
open crabs they also all have their

1520
00:50:24,495 --> 00:50:26,655
phones on video and so i think

1521
00:50:26,655 --> 00:50:28,185
they all were they were all recording

1522
00:50:28,185 --> 00:50:31,114
something yeah so they were well with

1523
00:50:31,114 --> 00:50:32,715
this was a party to celebrate the

1524
00:50:32,715 --> 00:50:34,305
turtles being hatched you know how that

1525
00:50:34,305 --> 00:50:36,495
happens on the issue okay so yeah

1526
00:50:36,585 --> 00:50:37,965
the mermaid is gonna come out and

1527
00:50:37,986 --> 00:50:39,225
bring the turtles into or you know

1528
00:50:39,255 --> 00:50:41,445
help escort them into the water and

1529
00:50:41,445 --> 00:50:42,759
then all these people were

1530
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:45,870
and then mayhem ensues so yeah as

1531
00:50:45,870 --> 00:50:47,850
far as we know yeah it's now

1532
00:50:47,850 --> 00:50:49,620
the time to ask about pictures or

1533
00:50:49,650 --> 00:50:51,420
no because i'd love a selfie one

1534
00:50:51,420 --> 00:50:52,470
second okay

1535
00:50:53,616 --> 00:50:55,200
looks like what we've got here is

1536
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:58,860

at this party by the pixies because

1542
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:09,960
it looks like what we got here

1543
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:13,200
is a wave of mutilation

1544
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:19,830

thirty seconds into the song

up what constitutes a murder okay

the street that's what i found between

00:57:00,870 --> 00:57:04,530
manslaughter and murder manslaughter is if ah

1694
00:57:04,560 --> 00:57:06,630
