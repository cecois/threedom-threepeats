382
00:13:32,365 --> 00:13:33,595
it's like is your brain just not

383
00:13:33,595 --> 00:13:35,605
seeing your brain your brain is editing

384
00:13:35,605 --> 00:13:36,805
because you know here's it was not

i only believe in science and facts

387
00:13:41,755 --> 00:13:43,285
and what i believe is there's some

388
00:13:43,285 --> 00:13:44,995
part of my brain that's not accessing

389
00:13:44,995 --> 00:13:46,015
that because i'm thinking about it so

390
00:13:46,015 --> 00:13:47,848
hard well no there's nothing like such

391
00:13:47,848 --> 00:13:49,375
a spirits or mediums or go

392
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:50,815
it's there's no such thing as psychics

393
00:13:50,995 --> 00:13:53,185
i don't believe in anything like that

394
00:13:54,715 --> 00:13:56,215
i i think what i think what's

395
00:13:56,215 --> 00:13:59,905
happening is you know how you know

396
00:13:59,905 --> 00:14:01,585
how if like something is messy in

397
00:14:01,585 --> 00:14:04,134
your room yeah your brain use that

398
00:14:04,134 --> 00:14:06,025
sock to clean the one on your

399
00:14:06,025 --> 00:14:07,345
day you guys have ruined me

400
00:14:08,605 --> 00:14:11,635
i wouldn't my mind would even go

401
00:14:11,635 --> 00:14:13,375
to that but it does or what

402
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:15,175
does that mean okay so you're in

403
00:14:15,175 --> 00:14:17,155
your diner always there you're on you're

404
00:14:17,155 --> 00:14:18,655
here you're in your dining room and

405
00:14:18,655 --> 00:14:19,975
on the dining room table there's some

406
00:14:19,975 --> 00:14:22,142
male that you've like left there yeah

407
00:14:22,405 --> 00:14:23,965
your table gets so out of fucking

408
00:14:23,965 --> 00:14:26,845
control yes exactly hey so when you

409
00:14:26,845 --> 00:14:28,615
go through your your dining room

410
00:14:28,735 --> 00:14:30,235
you edit it out of your field

411
00:14:30,235 --> 00:14:31,825
division because you don't want to be

412
00:14:31,825 --> 00:14:34,195
unhappy and looking at it would make

413
00:14:34,195 --> 00:14:35,875
you feel because it's annoying because it's

414
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:38,335
annoying so your wallet will try that

415
00:14:38,695 --> 00:14:40,945
your wallet was somewhere that you like

416
00:14:40,945 --> 00:14:43,615
we're editing and out of your thing

417
00:14:43,615 --> 00:14:45,985
and you're like not recognizing it as

418
00:14:45,985 --> 00:14:47,845
a wallet because you recognizing it as

419
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:48,355
clutter

420
00:14:49,345 --> 00:14:52,135
right maybe oh that's my theory i

421
00:14:52,135 --> 00:14:53,665
think you don't have to shit on

422
00:14:53,665 --> 00:14:56,335
it i said amazing granted me i

423
00:14:56,335 --> 00:14:57,922
think already that actually helped me maybe

424
00:14:57,925 --> 00:15:00,130

00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:28,850
mainly of music i feel like where

740
00:26:28,850 --> 00:26:31,250
it was like his banjo museu whereas

741
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:32,870
mainly banjo stuff but then he would

742
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:35,090
you know like talking between the songs

743
00:26:35,090 --> 00:26:37,160
and then they were like i think

744
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,720
they had to er the or they

745
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,250
got the opportunity to do a show

746
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:42,050
together and they just kind of combined

747
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:43,430
it where they had each did less

748
00:26:43,430 --> 00:26:45,140
time and then they also wrote

749
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:46,850
much of jokes about each other yeah

750
00:26:46,850 --> 00:26:47,810
i've seen them kind of do that

751
00:26:47,810 --> 00:26:49,610

good because they can do less time

00:26:54,410 --> 00:26:55,760
and then they seem to be having

756
00:26:55,850 --> 00:26:57,710

steve martin started playing his first banjo

867
00:30:42,485 --> 00:30:44,015
song i started tearing up for some

868
00:30:44,015 --> 00:30:45,485
reason because it was meaningful to you

869
00:30:45,575 --> 00:30:47,705
i don't know something about nostalgia for

870
00:30:47,705 --> 00:30:50,255
my youth there's something not right that

871
00:30:50,255 --> 00:30:51,605
for no reason it hit me right

872
00:30:51,605 --> 00:30:53,855
before the show started like wow this

873
00:30:53,855 --> 00:30:56,105

these these are like two people that

876
00:31:00,065 --> 00:31:01,715
got me into the life that i

877
00:31:01,715 --> 00:31:03,485

they love those little guys with the

992
00:34:50,685 --> 00:34:52,565
very cutesy i have not been exposed

993
00:34:52,565 --> 00:34:54,395
to all of the overexposure of the

994
00:34:54,395 --> 00:34:55,805
memes and stuff like that i've only

995
00:34:55,805 --> 00:34:56,975
known i mean yeah i see the

996
00:34:56,975 --> 00:34:59,225
ads every once in awhile but i

997
00:34:59,225 --> 00:35:00,305
feel like i've i've

998
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:02,165
i learned a lot about minions without

999
00:35:02,165 --> 00:35:04,385
knowing anything yeah what i mean what

1000
00:35:04,385 --> 00:35:06,035
is there to know really i know

1001
00:35:06,035 --> 00:35:09,245
they don't speak english but they speak

1002
00:35:09,245 --> 00:35:10,985
many of these queen's english they were

1003
00:35:10,985 --> 00:35:12,665
around for the rise of gru

1004
00:35:14,465 --> 00:35:15,965
but like the language they speak is

1005
00:35:15,968 --> 00:35:17,465
like a combination of a bunch of

1006
00:35:17,465 --> 00:35:19,385
languages right they call it menu knees

1007
00:35:19,385 --> 00:35:21,335
but yeah i believe it's i don't

1008
00:35:21,335 --> 00:35:23,255
think they the rise of the room

1009
00:35:25,745 --> 00:35:26,945

everyone was talking about it how were

1048
00:36:47,886 --> 00:36:49,505
people even seeing it if they were

1049
00:36:49,505 --> 00:36:51,065

00:36:53,795 --> 00:36:55,385
it again on the same tape but

1053
00:36:55,385 --> 00:36:57,335
you forget that soap operas were designed

1054
00:36:57,335 --> 00:36:59,435
for the stay at home mom yeah

1055
00:36:59,525 --> 00:37:00,995
but i mean if but but it

1056
00:37:00,995 --> 00:37:02,225
had to have been so big but

1057
00:37:02,225 --> 00:37:04,085
i remember dallas was also huge at

1058
00:37:04,085 --> 00:37:05,975

00:37:07,385 --> 00:37:10,505
oh yeah falcon crest yeah not as

1060
00:37:10,505 --> 00:37:13,625
huge could anything be as big now

1061
00:37:13,715 --> 00:37:14,855
is that i don't think so i

1062
00:37:14,855 --> 00:37:17,645
mean yeah isn't a lot of opportunities

1063
00:37:17,645 --> 00:37:19,265
but but everyone still feels like there's

1064
00:37:19,265 --> 00:37:21,305
something that everyone's excited like many thrones

1065
00:37:22,891 --> 00:37:24,815
even stranger things you'd like would just

1066
00:37:24,815 --> 00:37:27,605
huge um million people you know are

1067
00:37:27,605 --> 00:37:28,745
like oh don't give a shit about

1068
00:37:28,745 --> 00:37:31,535
but i feel like soap operas because

1069
00:37:31,595 --> 00:37:33,545
that's that's more rare for everyone to

1070
00:37:33,575 --> 00:37:35,525
be interested in that like it's a

1071
00:37:35,555 --> 00:37:38,225
very specific style of television yes it

1072
00:37:38,225 --> 00:37:40,655
is weird this is this dumb thing

1073
00:37:40,655 --> 00:37:42,305
that is just designed to like

1074
00:37:42,545 --> 00:37:45,545
make housewives have a tv on then

1075
00:37:45,545 --> 00:37:47,765
suddenly everyone's talking about it one year

1076
00:37:49,025 --> 00:37:50,165
and then no one talks about it

1077
00:37:50,165 --> 00:37:53,445
ever again there has been discussion about

1078
00:37:53,465 --> 00:37:54,995
the only thing that is designed to

1079
00:37:54,995 --> 00:37:56,795
make housewives have a tv while i

1080
00:37:56,795 --> 00:37:59,345
like susan lucci from all mitchell's right

1081
00:37:59,375 --> 00:38:02,255
lou was now only five trillion times

1082
00:38:02,615 --> 00:38:05,015
but everyone that's right she finally won

1083
00:38:05,075 --> 00:38:07,235
she did she finally said yeah good

1084
00:38:07,265 --> 00:38:09,155
yeah thank god we finally stopped

1085
00:38:09,155 --> 00:38:10,535
talking about her early and then she

1086
00:38:10,535 --> 00:38:12,965
dropped it on the stage yeah she

1087
00:38:12,965 --> 00:38:14,105
went up she put her hands on

1088
00:38:14,105 --> 00:38:16,025
the trophy and then she died yeah

1089
00:38:16,145 --> 00:38:17,315
but you know i guess what's kind

1090
00:38:17,315 --> 00:38:19,025
of funny she became a trophy she'd

1091
00:38:19,025 --> 00:38:22,205
be because of our internet you know

1092
00:38:22,205 --> 00:38:24,335
that we all share we can find

1093
00:38:24,485 --> 00:38:26,585
