237
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:28,170
funny as if an animatronic hugh grant

238
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:30,090

239
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:32,670
used his animatronic fingertip polk the animatronic

240
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,800
pillsbury doughboy and then they both said

241
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,810
like oh whatever they say

242
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:45,420

00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:42,040
it should be illegal and i think

592
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,480
we should stop parents from doing this

593
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,220
is this is we should make law

594
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:48,370

the poster designer oh right of course

756
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:13,240

here we go

760
00:26:22,930 --> 00:26:25,060
yeah those autos very scary especially when

761
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:26,260
you find out he's not pluggedin yeah

762
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:27,880
what the fuck now that's gonna freeze

763
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:30,610
yes sentient then xl tar is that

764
00:26:30,610 --> 00:26:32,350
what they're implying is that he sent

765
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:34,660
hint he is even adjusted had he's

766
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:36,490
from hell i think so

767
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,890
why else would he do that it's

768
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:40,540
a good point what weird lesson to

769
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:41,800
teach a kid who wished to be

770
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,150
big because you don't mean what was

771
00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:45,070
the point of that whole exercise if

772
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:46,090
he's not a demon from hell i

773
00:26:46,090 --> 00:26:48,100
mean right he gets to have sex

774
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:50,800
yeah but then he traumatized this woman

775
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:53,170
who's committed statutory rape me but she

776
00:26:53,170 --> 00:26:54,760
doesn't know that she's just at the

777
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,470
end she finds out she finds out

778
00:26:56,470 --> 00:26:56,920
that yes

779
00:26:57,670 --> 00:26:59,470
transform into a little boy sort of

780
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:02,170
heartwarming at that point oh right but

781
00:27:02,170 --> 00:27:03,610
the weirdest part of it bending the

782
00:27:03,610 --> 00:27:06,250
end is he's gone for how long

783
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:08,110
has he caught for eight years like

784
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:10,870
he's gonna say yeah knows married has

785
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:12,250
children has gone for a while because

786
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:14,380
he fully gets a job he's right

787
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:15,730
he's gone for a long time that

788
00:27:15,730 --> 00:27:17,380
promoting terrifies his mm

789
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:19,270
mother his mother comes back to his

790
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:20,830
mother's like where were you for the

791
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:23,890
last twenty years that mercedes rahel oh

792
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:26,500
yeah whatever happened remember city's rule i

793
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:27,790
don't know i helped the family all

794
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:29,470
went to therapy but i hope that

795
00:27:29,530 --> 00:27:31,330
i hope so well you know i

796
00:27:31,330 --> 00:27:32,830
don't what if they didn't just bottle

797
00:27:32,839 --> 00:27:33,820
it all but i don't think that

798
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:35,230
he should even try to explain what

799
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:37,270
really happened why everything sounds like a

800
00:27:37,285 --> 00:27:37,540
pitch

801
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:40,330
ich my yeah big sql i know

802
00:27:40,330 --> 00:27:42,490
starring colin hanks and call yeah

803
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:47,290
yeah okay no it's called small gotta

804
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:48,580
be called it's called too big

805
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:52,900
it's called medium now it's probably the

806
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:54,040
the real way to do it is

807
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:57,040
like his son wishes he was big

808
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,630
and he's like let me take you

809
00:27:58,630 --> 00:28:00,340
to the carnival well it's like oh

810
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:02,350
let's not know his teen wolf the

811
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:03,850
dad is we don't want to see

812
00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:05,170
that what i'm saying is i want

813
00:28:05,170 --> 00:28:06,940
to see but they both go in

814
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:08,980
and they've swapped play yeah let me

815
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:09,760
finish

816
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:12,460
so they both go to the carnival

817
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:13,960
he's like sohn i got a machine

818
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,130
and we're going to be best buds

819
00:28:15,130 --> 00:28:16,330
now because we'll be the same age

820
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:20,200
and then xl tar makes colin hanks

821
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,240
small and then he has to hang

822
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,730
out with his son for an entire

823
00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:27,220
summer and he's like he has paper

824
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:28,750

00:28:30,190 --> 00:28:32,500
that's a good idea has chores yes

827
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:34,300
to go to bed he gives himself

828
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:35,290
chores yeah

829
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:40,354
yes go to school learn arithmetic well

830
00:28:40,421 --> 00:28:41,560
sort of like back to the future

831
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:43,943
situation because yeah it's like you're hanging

832
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:46,030
with his three teenage mom i want

833
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:48,820
to see the psychological fallout of what

834
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:52,060
happened does is grow that much between

835
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:55,000
high school finishes broke that much between

836
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,470
high school and calls on if you're

837
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,870
excited or not you might be yeah

838
00:28:59,410 --> 00:29:01,210
well i think his penis wouldn't get

839
00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:03,130
that small do they do they grow

840
00:29:03,130 --> 00:29:05,800
that much between me seeing pamela anderson

841
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:06,250
or nazi

842
00:29:08,770 --> 00:29:09,820
so when you see her at small

843
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:10,870
when she walks away yeah i don't

844
00:29:10,870 --> 00:29:11,170
want to go

845
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:17,230
but because elizabeth perkins is still around

846
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:18,730
she's still arrived on still around right

847
00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:20,980

00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:22,330
do we want to get his like

849
00:29:22,330 --> 00:29:24,670
on this in this if if it's

850
00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:26,260
present day of course he'd be dead

851
00:29:26,410 --> 00:29:27,820
he was an old man then but

852
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:29,530
what if socom hanks is still around

853
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:31,210
and tom hanks is still around have

854
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:32,230
colin hanks wish he

855
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:35,200

856
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,790

857
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:40,390
wishes no results soldiers right there though

858
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:42,850
no zol tar is gone to the

859
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:46,120
dump guys guys guys stop fighting and

860
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,140
just make the movie

861
00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:50,020
trust in yourself and it will be

862
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:52,060
great without a script honestly the only

863
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:53,320
way to sell this argument is to

864
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:55,136
start working together i think so

865
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,180
i think so in a great partnership

866
00:29:58,570 --> 00:29:59,380
huh

867
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:02,290
i feel you just you're only interested

868
00:30:02,290 --> 00:30:04,870
in like an interior drama where it's

869
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:08,294
just the examining the psychological ramifications you

870
00:30:08,294 --> 00:30:09,880
don't want any magic i want to

871
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:12,220
see the weirdness of them having to

872
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:13,810
deal with it and just the mother

873
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:16,420
has the mother accepted that it happened

874
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:18,040
or is she still in denial about

875
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:19,540
everything everyone has acce

876
00:30:20,125 --> 00:30:21,895
and everyone that was involved in this

877
00:30:22,315 --> 00:30:24,415
believes it they know that it happened

878
00:30:24,445 --> 00:30:25,915
so the mother walks home in a

879
00:30:25,915 --> 00:30:28,225
suit that's for a man but that

880
00:30:28,225 --> 00:30:31,045
could happen tomorrow or later yeah haven't

881
00:30:31,045 --> 00:30:32,635
you ever been kidnapped by someone and

882
00:30:32,635 --> 00:30:34,195
they put you in their basis what

883
00:30:34,195 --> 00:30:36,355
he's defending east protecting the murderer they

884
00:30:36,355 --> 00:30:38,125
just go just why they murder haley

885
00:30:38,209 --> 00:30:40,255
really murder took your clothes there

886
00:30:40,315 --> 00:30:41,305
want to be younger they just they're

887
00:30:41,515 --> 00:30:43,105
successful it's actually creepy they took his

888
00:30:43,105 --> 00:30:44,665
regular clothes and they they're like fine

889
00:30:44,665 --> 00:30:45,565
just wear one of ours back we

890
00:30:45,565 --> 00:30:47,695
already really ruined we already ruined your

891
00:30:48,565 --> 00:30:50,815
back okay so this is what the

892
00:30:50,815 --> 00:30:52,885
mother believes her mind snaps so she's

893
00:30:52,885 --> 00:30:55,315
going insane so she's rubber mind has

894
00:30:55,315 --> 00:30:57,265
snapped within the first eight minutes of

895
00:30:57,265 --> 00:30:59,245
the film elizabeth perkins has become a

896
00:30:59,245 --> 00:31:00,445
nun because she can

897
00:31:00,445 --> 00:31:02,455
not yale with what has happened yeah

898
00:31:02,515 --> 00:31:03,895
yeah who else is in this

899
00:31:05,125 --> 00:31:06,325
those are the only ones and people

900
00:31:06,325 --> 00:31:07,285
that i can think yeah it was

901
00:31:07,285 --> 00:31:09,565
a three hunter what other best friend

945
00:32:43,405 --> 00:32:46,435
yeah um one of my favorite that's

946
00:32:46,435 --> 00:32:48,985
the only time that convention has worked

947
00:32:48,985 --> 00:32:51,115
for me yeah because it's a convention

948
00:32:51,115 --> 00:32:52,255
that they use a lot when you

949
00:32:52,255 --> 00:32:53,605
want to stat i'm the only person

950
00:32:53,605 --> 00:32:54,775
who knows this thing no no no

951
00:32:54,805 --> 00:32:56,035
these people have known each other for

952
00:32:56,035 --> 00:32:57,685
a long time yeah right and so

953
00:32:57,685 --> 00:32:59,065
they they see each other and they

954
00:32:59,065 --> 00:33:02,605
immediately go into some light elaborate choreographed

955
00:33:02,605 --> 00:33:03,325
thing or

956
00:33:03,325 --> 00:33:06,505
or rhyme or whatever yeah that didn't

957
00:33:06,505 --> 00:33:08,155
really work so because it feels really

958
00:33:08,155 --> 00:33:10,435
authentic and yes part of it too

959
00:33:10,435 --> 00:33:13,465
is that tom hanks who worked with

960
00:33:13,525 --> 00:33:16,915
the kid actor ultra and studied him

961
00:33:16,945 --> 00:33:18,445
yeah tried to act like him yeah

962
00:33:18,445 --> 00:33:20,005
please also did the same thing before

963
00:33:20,005 --> 00:33:22,765
it's gone he worked his shadow killer

964
00:33:22,765 --> 00:33:23,365
free

965
00:33:23,695 --> 00:33:26,215
the kid actor had a strong accent

966
00:33:26,215 --> 00:33:28,135
and so instead of having the kid

967
00:33:28,137 --> 00:33:31,915
speak differently he had adapted yes that's

968
00:33:31,915 --> 00:33:32,665
why it's so bad

969
00:33:34,045 --> 00:33:37,195
ah i haven't watched that movie since

970
00:33:37,195 --> 00:33:39,475
i was a teen probably so watching

971
00:33:39,771 --> 00:33:41,935
him yeah good i liked it i

972
00:33:41,935 --> 00:33:43,345
remember thinking at the time it was

973
00:33:43,345 --> 00:33:46,765
like a epic historical film it's honestly

974
00:33:46,765 --> 00:33:48,415
it's a great stunt you know what

975
00:33:48,415 --> 00:33:50,335
i mean like the that aspect of

976
00:33:50,335 --> 00:33:51,955
it is still i think very good

977
00:33:51,955 --> 00:33:53,541
but i remember i did not see

978
00:33:53,575 --> 00:33:53,965

999
00:34:36,025 --> 00:34:37,705
don't look at me we face away

1000
00:34:37,705 --> 00:34:40,015
from each other yeah yeah we're all

1001
00:34:40,015 --> 00:34:41,815
three standing with our backs to each

1002
00:34:41,815 --> 00:34:43,225
other we do this by the way

1003
00:34:43,225 --> 00:34:44,425
we do the show standing which i

1004
00:34:44,425 --> 00:34:46,285
don't think people appreciate yeah they started

1005
00:34:46,405 --> 00:34:48,505
to attach all you know we always

1006
00:34:48,505 --> 00:34:50,572
did super ego standing really really oh

1007
00:34:50,572 --> 00:34:52,975
yeah i remember doing y yeah i

1008
00:34:52,975 --> 00:34:54,595
don't know i couldn't tell you because

1009
00:34:54,625 --> 00:34:56,185
we could easily have sat down but

1010
00:34:56,185 --> 00:34:57,895
i do remember once jeremy carter doing

1011
00:34:57,895 --> 00:35:00,055
spontaneous nation and saying he can't improvise

1012
00:35:00,085 --> 00:35:03,325
v sitting down that's probably what i

1013
00:35:03,325 --> 00:35:05,815
would imagine that's why i think for

1014
00:35:05,815 --> 00:35:06,415
i guess for

1015
00:35:06,445 --> 00:35:08,695
energy but it it actually ended up

1016
00:35:08,705 --> 00:35:10,975
stashing energy more yeah

1017
00:35:12,265 --> 00:35:14,155

1229
00:43:13,445 --> 00:43:15,635
die there's been some doubt over whether

1230
00:43:15,635 --> 00:43:17,495
this is an organic phenomenon or a

1231
00:43:17,495 --> 00:43:19,715
marketing stunt by smirnoff which the company

1232
00:43:19,715 --> 00:43:22,475
has flatly denied oh my

1233
00:43:22,475 --> 00:43:24,035
hey guys let's take them to court

1234
00:43:24,875 --> 00:43:25,985

00:43:25,985 --> 00:43:27,905
put them on the stand beyond him

1236
00:43:27,905 --> 00:43:30,155
solicit nothing slur on the beverages taste

1237
00:43:30,155 --> 00:43:32,225
i doubt any alcoholic beverage company would

1238
00:43:32,225 --> 00:43:33,665
want to be associated with a drinking

1239
00:43:33,665 --> 00:43:35,825
game that stretches the boundaries of good

1240
00:43:35,825 --> 00:43:38,615
taste and common sense like this one

1241
00:43:38,615 --> 00:43:41,405
does at the same time the viral

1242
00:43:41,405 --> 00:43:42,545
spread of the game has seen a

1243
00:43:42,545 --> 00:43:42,635
boo

1244
00:43:42,635 --> 00:43:44,135
boost in sales for the company oh

1245
00:43:44,135 --> 00:43:44,585
interesting

1246
00:43:45,755 --> 00:43:46,955
they only want to be associated with

1247
00:43:46,955 --> 00:43:49,685
the tasteful drinking games yeah what but

1248
00:43:49,685 --> 00:43:51,665
what is you have to you that

1249
00:43:51,682 --> 00:43:53,945
okay they touched the bottle and then

1250
00:43:53,945 --> 00:43:55,115
they have to drink the whole thing

1251
00:43:55,925 --> 00:43:58,415
i believe so yeah cool we should

1252
00:43:58,415 --> 00:43:59,825
play this really cool do you want

1253
00:43:59,825 --> 00:44:00,665

we surprise each other with asia

1259
00:44:10,655 --> 00:44:11,765
and then we're all wasted

1260
00:44:13,805 --> 00:44:15,425

1261
00:44:15,425 --> 00:44:18,065
