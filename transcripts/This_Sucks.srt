29
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:19,020

30
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:19,920
other day and i was like

31
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:23,340
i wish that my parents and not

32
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:24,720
to roll it off on my parents

33
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:25,920
or blame them but i wish that

34
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,110
i had some sort of cultural sensitivity

35
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:30,120
training when i was young me too

36
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:33,240
because i remember my friend eating seaweed

37
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,130
for a snack and all of us

38
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:37,470
going like oh gross oh that sucks

41
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,520
fine but i wish i could have

42
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:43,200
i wish someone would have said to

43
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,660
me like hey you're going to experience

44
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:47,400
someone who is not white or even

45
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,600
a white person who has who

46
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:53,820

the cliches about bankston youth and turning

forty years later oh i have so

82
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,920
many things like that from when i

83
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,300
was a kid that like you're just

84
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,980
a dumb and also when you're when

85
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:07,530
you're i was raised in a in

86
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:10,860
a place where like casual racism was

87
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:11,760
just yeah and fill it

88
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,620
sophia where'd you know casual racism was

89
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:15,157
just the order of the day and

90
00:03:15,176 --> 00:03:16,710
you didn't and the people around me

91
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:18,420
and and the language of the used

92
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:20,040
and everything was just a part of

93
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,660
my life and it was not until

94
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:23,490
i got out in the world that

95
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:26,160
i realised oh guy was incorrect is

96
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,170
there any sort of ceremony to let

97
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:30,750
something like that go and i know

98
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:31,920
there is like a p

99
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,870
put it in a box and throw

100
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:35,310
it into the fire whatever save it

101
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:36,570
for anybody but you know what i

102
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:38,400
mean but do they work you know

103
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,440
like to like to absolve yourself of

104
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,420

is jason but it's i know the

118
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:07,050
angle i'm now the angle i'm taking

119
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:09,240
on it is is lauren you are

120
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,640
more why wouldn't even say you're spiritual

121
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,150
but you do

122
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:14,280
don't you do stuff like this sometimes

123
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,720
yeah to get rid of ah yes

124
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,770
to get rid of is there something

125
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:19,290
one can do i feel like with

126
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:25,050
that stuff it's really maybe therapy oh

127
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:26,357
there'll be able to live i guess

128
00:04:26,382 --> 00:04:28,530
just found about bindon because i think

129
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:31,530
i started therapy this year or thank

130
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:32,400
two thousand and ah

131
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,739
god i know i know and i

132
00:04:34,739 --> 00:04:36,000
know you've never been with herbs i've

133
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:39,300
never been oh and i always thought

134
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:40,530
it's not kind of cool but i

135
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:42,390
also always like i'm fine you know

136
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:43,710
like i was like i it i'm

137
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:45,990
fine and it has been great and

138
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:47,732
i've also found like the things that

139
00:04:47,732 --> 00:04:48,450
i'll end up talking about will be

140
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:50,010
surprising it's like maybe something like that

141
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:51,450
where you're like oh i guess this

142
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:52,560
thing really does bother me

143
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:54,420
that i have this memory and it's

144
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:56,070
just kind of good to like get

145
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:57,570
it off your chest to somebody and

146
00:04:57,570 --> 00:04:59,430
have them just be like an unbiased

147
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:01,320
sort of i don't know i believe

148
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:03,480
obsessing doesn't maria bamford say something about

149
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:06,120
if if you say it's than it

150
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:07,980
or then it's manageable or something like

151
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:09,930
they'll we're basically like comedy has helped

152
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:12,623
her so much with her

153
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,390
troubles because she can say it on

154
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:16,860
stage and it gives it less power

155
00:05:17,010 --> 00:05:18,090
well i think that's true i think

156
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:20,880
like what without ever going to therapy

157
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:22,860
for ever my whole life anything that

158
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:25,740
i had that i was like thinking

159
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:27,433
about those upsetting to me it's unsafe

160
00:05:27,499 --> 00:05:29,040
was just like i'm just over thinking

161
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,450
it in my head and then i

162
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,610
just it can become so big so

163
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:32,850
big

164
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,140
but then yeah and i'm saying the

165
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:35,520
first time you say it it's hard

166
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:37,650
yeah and then the fifteenth time you

167
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:38,940
say it it's like oh yeah this

168
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:40,740
yeah carrying things around like that is

169
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,780
terrible it's really terrible when it's just

170
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,700
it's just living inside your head yeah

171
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,870
that's why i don't think we should

172
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:47,820
be spanked that is what i'm trying

173
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,200
to say like the more times we

174
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:53,040
say something are real stories yes this

175
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,300
this is me trying to get out

176
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,520
of being spanked okay look i don't

177
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,600
want to thank you so i think

178
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,490
we're all fine i'm not gonna make

179
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:00,090
zig do it

180
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:02,640
that's to me is the hardest that

181
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,180
would be fun

182
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,550
why is it fine if kevin does

183
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:07,048
and it's not if if zig did

184
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:08,460
it i'd be like i'd feel sick

185
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:11,820
seems like a real person yeah kevin

186
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,995

we've talked about it right

203
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,680

204
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:58,260
the commercial with um where the guy

205
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:00,030
sees i think on our last season

206
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:01,380
yeah we talked about it and we

207
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:02,970

00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:04,110
no no no well we talked about

209
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:05,460
the new wow we did where the

210
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:07,800
guy sees a dog and then he

211
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,910
sees two dogs and then one of

212
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:12,150
the dogs disappears so my question is

213
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:13,800
one of the dog doggy one of

214
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:13,920
the

215
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:17,100
dogs is real well that is he

216
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:19,410
seeing is he seeing no dog as

217
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:21,510
he's seeing is he seeing a two

218
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:23,520
dogs where there are no dogs resisting

219
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,340
two dogs whether they're one dog or

220
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:30,510
izzy should he be seen three dogs

221
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,080
three dogs and one is is

222
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:36,000
not suitable to him and then the

223
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,220
second one also becomes is there a

224
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:39,930
pack of basset hounds that he should

225
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:41,850
be see i just feel really upset

226
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:44,190
knowing that parkinson's has the side effect

227
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:46,650
of hallucination which i did not know

228
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:48,210
until these commercials mean i didn't know

229
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:48,960
that was a part of it i

230
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,030

637
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:08,890
day the clown cried in two consecutive

642
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:20,530
shutdowns okay so little backstory patton oswald

643
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:21,130
will be had

644
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:24,010
um ah would do stage readings of

645
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:25,600
the script of the day the clown

646
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,280
cried because it's an oh yes i'm

647
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:28,601
i just that we've talked about and

648
00:21:28,601 --> 00:21:31,210
so labour movie jerry lewis directed that

649
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:32,530
never saw the light of day and

650
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:34,300
i saw and it was the first

651
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:37,360
in a genre of concentration camp comedies

652
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,680
yeah and jerry lewis for a while

653
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,210
was saying there were rights issues but

654
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:41,620
then i saw him before his death

655
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:43,570
and he admitted he in an in

656
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:45,460
an interview then and in several other

657
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:46,540
interviews he's like no i did a

658
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:48,460
terrible job with it and he died

659
00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:50,380
that's why yeah we always have to

660
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:52,660
remember anyways so fine we were doing

661
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:54,070
stage readings of it and i did

662
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:55,600
it over like a ten year period

663
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,220
i think like often on patent would

664
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:58,870
call you into service you're doing it

665
00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:00,880
again yeah i missed a couple but

666
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:01,780
sometimes do anyway

667
00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:03,550
so we did want over in in

668
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:08,260
santa monica at the powerhouse theatre yes

669
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:10,000
that's what it was called yeah and

670
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,810
um and the rightsholders to that ah

671
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,070
it was written about in the la

672
00:22:15,070 --> 00:22:17,020
weekly so the rights holders to that

673
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:20,050
script came and gave patton a season

674
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:21,910
desist order and the weird

675
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:24,550
part about it as i recall patton

676
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:25,960
writes about it differently in his book

677
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:29,290
but um was that i recall patent

678
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:30,850
saying yeah we're not gonna we're not

679
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:31,120

684
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,730

going on stage right yeah so in

689
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:51,730
any case the other weird part about

690
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:52,420
that whole story

691
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:54,160

00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:58,660
these stairs waiting to go on and

694
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:01,090
i'm leaning against a rail a wooden

695
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:04,360
rail and it suddenly breaks and i

696
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:08,740
go crashing down into like i only

an appellee gonna get a little wrong

830
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:27,100
but she was playing on this machine

831
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:29,020
that was off and then it turned

832
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:30,610
out like a threshing machine like some

833
00:27:30,610 --> 00:27:32,650
sort of crazy thing oh barring your

834
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:35,890
purposes horrible it's trope telling off and

but hey

838
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:44,620
it's that happens to people like who's

839
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:46,660
to say like we've here's one example

840
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:50,530

i trained from los angeles to philadelphia

892
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:35,020

00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:37,539

00:36:10,595 --> 00:36:13,236
really every birthday fifty this year yeah

1090
00:36:13,265 --> 00:36:15,515
it's all fifty spiders nice row number

1091
00:36:15,515 --> 00:36:18,965
fifty um i don't think about it

1092
00:36:18,965 --> 00:36:20,405
mostly and then every once in a

1093
00:36:20,405 --> 00:36:21,485
while i think about it and it's

1094
00:36:21,485 --> 00:36:23,015
weird yeah but i kind of fit

1095
00:36:23,015 --> 00:36:24,425
about every age a little bit like

1096
00:36:24,425 --> 00:36:25,955
once you pass thirty like i don't

1097
00:36:25,955 --> 00:36:27,365
know i'm thirty three and i think

1098
00:36:27,665 --> 00:36:29,495
thirty three when i was a kid

1099
00:36:29,495 --> 00:36:30,755
that sounded like an adult

1100
00:36:30,905 --> 00:36:32,765
well the fact that fifties very well

1101
00:36:32,765 --> 00:36:34,179
fifty is different than thirty three but

1102
00:36:34,179 --> 00:36:35,735
i'm just saying i still think you

1103

1184
00:39:16,145 --> 00:39:17,255
be that you would get to go

1266
00:42:00,645 --> 00:42:02,355
forty five minutes said i probably saw

it's just mean

1292
00:42:47,985 --> 00:42:48,765
oh why

1293
00:42:53,205 --> 00:42:54,640
there is a moment in that in

1294
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:57,705
that concert the black white concert with

1295
00:42:57,765 --> 00:42:58,995

1296
00:42:58,995 --> 00:43:02,235
great bruce springsteen singing backups yeah ah

1297
00:43:02,265 --> 00:43:05,445
gabi lang bonnie raitt right diane warren

1298
00:43:05,445 --> 00:43:07,365
i think all-star baca lineup it's an

1299
00:43:07,365 --> 00:43:09,705
all-star lineup including tom waits for some

1300
00:43:09,825 --> 00:43:13,185
lingo she's still around wow she's still

1301
00:43:13,185 --> 00:43:15,015
around i think she's just really saleable

1302
00:43:15,015 --> 00:43:16,785
not that long she decided to go

1303
00:43:16,815 --> 00:43:18,705
upper case with her and that changed

1304
00:43:18,705 --> 00:43:20,355
naming yeah yeah no one knows where

1305
00:43:20,355 --> 00:43:21,915
to find her anymore so search the

1306
00:43:21,915 --> 00:43:25,035
clouds um but they're so looks great

1307
00:43:25,035 --> 00:43:27,225
actually she does she looks really great

1308
00:43:27,255 --> 00:43:28,815
tom waits for some reason as part

1309
00:43:28,815 --> 00:43:29,955
of this lineup and he's

1310
00:43:29,985 --> 00:43:32,805
on a little oregon and so it's

1311
00:43:32,835 --> 00:43:34,365
i think it's during ruby duby

1312
00:43:35,985 --> 00:43:37,485
they're going around will be dubious like

1313
00:43:37,485 --> 00:43:39,555
this rave up and one of the

1314
00:43:39,608 --> 00:43:41,385
woman roy orbison is like more uptempo

1315
00:43:41,519 --> 00:43:43,575
yes people are taking little solos and

1316
00:43:43,575 --> 00:43:45,825
stuff and they throw it over to

1317
00:43:45,855 --> 00:43:48,255
tom waits and he just like

1318
00:43:49,455 --> 00:43:50,625
he might as well have done the

1319
00:43:50,625 --> 00:43:51,945
thing where you put your fist through

1320
00:43:51,945 --> 00:43:55,665
piano lengthening strengthening but he does this

1321
00:43:55,665 --> 00:43:56,205
weird

1322
00:43:57,375 --> 00:44:00,705
like stupid thing like or like half-assed

1323
00:44:00,705 --> 00:44:03,195
organ solo or whatever was probably can't

1324
00:44:03,195 --> 00:44:05,625
play he's not a musician but he

1325
00:44:05,625 --> 00:44:07,995
is i mean he is because his

1326
00:44:08,025 --> 00:44:09,975
early on no no yes no i'm

1327
00:44:09,975 --> 00:44:11,895
agreeing with yeah his early albums his

1328
00:44:11,895 --> 00:44:13,635
early albums are very different than the

1329
00:44:13,635 --> 00:44:16,095
stuff he does now they're much more

1330
00:44:16,095 --> 00:44:17,475
like sort of seventy s two

1331
00:44:17,475 --> 00:44:19,695
troubadour kind of stuff than than the

1332
00:44:19,695 --> 00:44:22,485
weird character like you don't wait either

1333
00:44:22,515 --> 00:44:23,610

00:55:03,420 --> 00:55:05,970
harris in the in memoriam i we

00:55:05,970 --> 00:55:08,010
all asked them

1615
00:55:09,270 --> 00:55:10,710
this is interesting i wanna know who's

1616
00:55:10,710 --> 00:55:12,540
in control of the memorial okay well

1617
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:14,010
did my favorite producers say and that's

1618
00:55:14,010 --> 00:55:16,920
the best so we we they mentioned

1619
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:19,680
it was done and we said can

1620
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:21,540
we ask you questions like we felt

1621
00:55:21,540 --> 00:55:23,490
weird asking about a book is our

1622
00:55:23,490 --> 00:55:25,890
friend in there and we said yeah

1623
00:55:26,100 --> 00:55:27,210
he said who's your friend and we

1624
00:55:27,210 --> 00:55:28,829
said harris he's like oh yes definitely

1625
00:55:28,830 --> 00:55:29,250
he's in there

1626
00:55:29,430 --> 00:55:30,960
oh that's so here we go he

1627
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:33,000
made the cut yeah because not everyone

1628
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:35,216
who dies gets in the old memoria

1629
00:55:35,216 --> 00:55:37,410
i think that's wrong i think that

1630
00:55:37,410 --> 00:55:38,880
i think every single person who died

1631
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:40,860
who ever worked whoever hasn't won i

1632
00:55:40,860 --> 00:55:42,120
am db credit should be in the

1633
00:55:42,120 --> 00:55:43,710
know but i think like there are

1634
00:55:43,740 --> 00:55:45,870
prolific people that you that don't make

1635
00:55:45,870 --> 00:55:47,460
it sometimes like why wasn't personally what

1636
00:55:47,460 --> 00:55:49,080
that's happened i know and i think

1637
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:49,530
that's we

1638
00:55:49,590 --> 00:55:51,120
i think that there should be one

1639
00:55:51,390 --> 00:55:52,620
i've talked about this there should be

1640
00:55:52,620 --> 00:55:54,210
one award show there's too many award

1641
00:55:54,210 --> 00:55:56,580
shows just make one award show the

1642
00:55:56,580 --> 00:55:58,950
awardees is twenty four hours long give

1643
00:55:58,950 --> 00:56:01,650
it a better name no the awardees

1644
00:56:01,650 --> 00:56:03,360
or the authorities is twenty four hours

1645
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:04,890
long we do the best music the

1646
00:56:04,890 --> 00:56:07,260
best in theater the best in film

1647
00:56:07,260 --> 00:56:09,630
the best in tv the best in

1648
00:56:09,750 --> 00:56:12,150
in web videos and all that and

1649
00:56:12,150 --> 00:56:13,710
then we knew and then we also

1650
00:56:13,710 --> 00:56:16,260
do one in memoriam and every single

1651
00:56:16,260 --> 00:56:17,730
person is in it and it's it's

1652
00:56:17,730 --> 00:56:19,680
probably two hours of the twenty four

1653
00:56:19,710 --> 00:56:21,000
so you're saying the webbys are also

1654
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:23,790
folded into the old yes that's instagram

1655
00:56:23,790 --> 00:56:25,320
account would also be x but you're

1656
00:56:25,530 --> 00:56:27,990
but you're you're kind of making the

1657
00:56:27,990 --> 00:56:29,670
shorties right or there's others

1658
00:56:30,148 --> 00:56:31,200
i think there are two other weapons

1659
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:33,660
and shortage different things fuck everything the

1660
00:56:33,750 --> 00:56:36,120
problem is that there's an in memoriam

1661
00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:38,550
for every category and they'd be too

1662
00:56:38,550 --> 00:56:39,720
many people i'd be like to it'd

1663
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:40,950
be a two hour long here's the

1664
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:42,840
big problem with the memoriam too is

1665
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:45,330
there's these assholes who like have been

1666
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:48,210
on stage on tv in movies and

1667
00:56:48,210 --> 00:56:49,710
also grammys and they suck up all

1668
00:56:49,710 --> 00:56:50,040
the ox

1669
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:52,200
origin for all the other people because

1670
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:54,030
they're an f during the grammys it's

1671
00:56:54,060 --> 00:56:56,400
during the tonys during the oscars during

1672
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:58,020
the the emmys and they and the

1673
00:56:58,020 --> 00:57:00,090
golden gloves they're in all these memorials

1674
00:57:00,540 --> 00:57:02,190
and then there's nothing for the rest

1675
00:57:02,190 --> 00:57:04,290
of us i think that when people

1676
00:57:04,290 --> 00:57:06,540
cheer um for the people they care

1677
00:57:06,540 --> 00:57:07,740
about or clap for people to care

1678
00:57:07,740 --> 00:57:09,277
about in memoriam it makes you feel

1679
00:57:09,277 --> 00:57:10,200
about for the next person

1680
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:11,310
and who pops up when they don't

1681
00:57:11,310 --> 00:57:14,190
some editor yeah i don't think that's

1682
00:57:14,190 --> 00:57:15,630
right we used to there's a group

1683
00:57:15,630 --> 00:57:16,650
of us used to go to movies

1684
00:57:16,650 --> 00:57:18,330
a lot and we would pick a

1685
00:57:18,330 --> 00:57:21,780
person to clap for during the credits

1686
00:57:22,620 --> 00:57:24,420
that's much like person we didn't know

1687
00:57:24,462 --> 00:57:27,180
were like let's let's clap for again

1688
00:57:27,180 --> 00:57:29,040
on this yeah whatever whatever credit we

1689
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:30,300
picked beforehand

1690
00:57:30,420 --> 00:57:32,040
right and then we would do it

1691
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:33,570
and it was very it was it

1692
00:57:33,570 --> 00:57:36,060
felt really satisfying for some reason yeah

1693
00:57:36,060 --> 00:57:37,110
