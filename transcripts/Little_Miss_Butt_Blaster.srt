about that thanks i know we have

55
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,550
there was an episode long discussion was

56
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:06,960

00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,650
i i when i was a kid

60
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:16,800
i remember hopefully we was a teenager

61
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:19,260
prime age when you're like am i

62
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:19,620
gay

63
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:23,100
trying to figure out like what if

64
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:24,240

66
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:28,740

you hold your hand yeah right like

70
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:37,560
because women will hold their hands out

71
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:39,540
and look at the nails like what

72
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:40,650

spy because he said i'll have two

78
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:52,020
drinks seem to this way was it

79
00:02:52,126 --> 00:02:54,030
it was because i don't remember that

80
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:56,190
it sounds dumb as shit yeah because

81
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:59,280

00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:00,840

in a task like that it's short

222
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:12,840
it took me less time than i

223
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:13,650
thought it was going to take me

224
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:14,880

we get

229
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:22,921
on the southwest here's what happened we're

230
00:08:22,921 --> 00:08:24,840
on separate reservations on the same flight

231
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,120
so we can't check we can't check

232
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,710
his privilege and interesting rangers so you

233
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:30,540
meet anyway oh this was this yeah

234
00:08:30,908 --> 00:08:32,130
we're both wearing trench coats with no

235
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:34,080
closing you always fly southwest you can

236
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,060
like try to find each other yeah

237
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:39,120
exactly like oh you already growing we

238
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,590
get by joining aisle seats though we

239
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:41,040
start make

240
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,960
going out furiously across your trench coats

241
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:45,960
come oh yeah and your raging hearts

242
00:08:45,968 --> 00:08:47,490
rights come out you don't know where

243
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:48,030
it was going

244
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:52,710
so i see that the early bird

245
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:55,139
option is available for you pay a

246
00:08:55,139 --> 00:08:56,935
little money you get in the eighteen

247
00:08:56,935 --> 00:08:58,650
because otherwise you have a seat yes

248
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:01,170
exactly which is exactly what happens so

249
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:03,150
you so you because do people get

250
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:05,280
mad if you save the seat you're

251
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,020
not you're not technically allowed to do

252
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:09,360
but when you're a you know ones

253
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:10,680
trying to sit next to each other

254
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:11,970
yet and then just you have a

255
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:13,380
minute you haven't so people are trying

256
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:15,330
to really fill those middles or cheney

257
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,920
we do she was in group b

258
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:18,000
and she was like towards the end

259
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,830
of group okay but beginning of b

260
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:21,540
is great yeah and to be bad

261
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:23,490

262
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:29,010
news so she um ah also we

263
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:29,481
always

264
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,560
do adjoining aisle seats instead of sitting

265
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,850
right next to each now why is

266
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:36,180
that sweetie it's just easier it's just

267
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:37,350
easier because no one has to be

268
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:38,610
in the middle we both liked the

269
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:40,410
aisle ca and nobody has to be

270
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:41,820
in the metal and you're not jumped

271
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:43,020

going to commence still do yeah i

390
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:36,840

00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,460
was about what was inside i'm sure

392
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:39,870

393
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:41,310

395
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:43,860
we just you

396
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:45,300
no we're looking for room to put

397
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,070
the suitcase away and that happens every

398
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:49,260
second yeah right and so janie then

399
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:51,030
has to like go back behind her

400
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,830
herself and put it in a in

401
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:54,570
a in an overhead bin a few

402
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:58,350
rows away feed antigo then more people

403
00:13:58,350 --> 00:13:59,820
get so janie sits down more people

404
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:01,560
come on the plane somebody tries to

405
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:02,790
do the same thing with this guy's

406
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:04,020
bag to z l m

407
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:06,030
yeah he's watching this thing like aw

408
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:07,800
hey does it fit that way put

409
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,300
it back you think you would relax

410
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:10,710
so but i think now he had

411
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:13,020
to do it again because he's shown

412
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,910
that he cares and janey tells me

413
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:17,070
she reveals she finds out from the

414
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:19,350
people ahead of next to her that

415
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:20,880
he did it before janie got onto

416
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:22,775
oh i didn't know so this guy

417
00:14:22,839 --> 00:14:24,150
just been watching this back

418
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,910
so this high reporting process or like

419
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:28,500
this guy's now yeah exactly cause also

420
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,610
what you should do if that's your

421
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:31,020
bag is let it be fucked with

422
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:33,480
because you look like you're wrong for

423
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,890
bringing the wrong sized bag and yes

424
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:37,140
don't just make it exam exactly you

425
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:38,730

429
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,230
you're quite right and he's he's sitting

430
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:47,340
with a woman next to him she

431
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:49,516
says nothing right of course she's like

432
00:14:49,663 --> 00:14:52,405

00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:22,860
this time ok um and but we

506
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:24,780
did show we did see that we

507
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:26,190
fuckin they got on first and we

508
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:28,290
looked and there was the back sideways

509
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:30,630
again i don't mind what did it

510
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:33,810
fit i i don't know but then

511
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:35,340
this happened janey was trying out a

512
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:38,100
new suitcase those like a slightly

513
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:40,650
bigger kerryon it was still a carry

514
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:42,870
on and then when we tried to

515
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:45,420
put it in our or overhead it

516
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:47,190
didn't quite fit and you had to

517
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:49,290
do it sideways ended up being sideways

518
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:52,860
wow sorry oh yeah it was perfect

519
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:55,140
you're a hypocrite you're an asshole but

520
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:56,490
i think the i think the flight

521
00:17:56,490 --> 00:17:57,960
attendant turn it sideways we didn't do

522
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:58,260
though

523
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:00,660
okay so because you you we we

524
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:02,400
all because like the jewelry dorm would

525
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,420
include we put it in and i

526
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:04,890
feel like i got it to where

527
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:07,080
it did close but then i think

528
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,220
there was room enough that the flight

529
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:09,960
attendant just turned around but i when

530
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,010
i saw it when we opened it

531
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:12,480
up it was very funny to me

532
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:16,410
wow contents may shift during the flight

533
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:18,060
as well well that is something man

534
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:18,960
that's so true

535
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:21,840
that's what my tattoo says can i

536
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,100
say i got a bunch of air

537
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,950
air or play-based to just from the

538
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:27,570
trip because they're so excited there's another

539
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:29,250
one like right on my pelvic bone

540
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:31,140
that says low tide across your lego

541
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:35,910
yeah before you get my tone is

542
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:38,220
fine okay okay we have to take

543
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:39,300
a break before it before you get

544
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:40,260
into what you want to say we're

545
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:41,070
going to take a break we'll be

546
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:41,400
right back

547
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,780
and we're back yes you can i

548
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:53,220
just say that i think if one

549
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:54,510
of us has a repetitive task to

550
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:56,100
do it really helps out the others

551
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:58,080
because we tell story i got through

552
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,670
that story in record time believe it

553
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:02,760
oh and fair yeah maybe i need

554

you were risking your lights bad um

622
00:21:18,595 --> 00:21:20,215

630
00:21:33,445 --> 00:21:34,555

aftertaste of this is that it was

634
00:21:41,125 --> 00:21:42,655
making me sick if anyone knows why

635
00:21:42,655 --> 00:21:43,885
