98
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,430
of felt me on my hand and

99
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:12,210
i looked down on a b which

100
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:13,680
is kind of live showing like a

101
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,540
yellowjacket a big a big big

102
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:18,060
fluffy but not a bumblebee just because

103
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,620
you offer it was ah it wasn't

104
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:20,880
a i feel like you're inventing a

105
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,920
category of be it was a thick

106
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:25,560
b o thick which was to see

107
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:29,820
ya to season two e's and i

108
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:32,280
started slapping onto my nephew i was

109
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,530
like wow trying to get it off

110
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,760
like using him as like lev

111
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,050
bridge to kick it off my hand

112
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:39,720
and then it was literally sticking it's

113
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:41,490
fucking ass into me as i was

114
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:42,870
doing that and stinging me and it

115
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:44,580
was horrible and it really more than

116
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:46,650
once no it's just send me really

117
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:48,300
hard and then the stinger was in

118
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,710
my hand this is why you like

119
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:51,660
always always carry a flower i guess

120
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:52,830
it's a bumblebee i did have a

121
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:54,480
little ball on the end i don't

122
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:55,740
know it's the abdomen

123
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,660
you always carry a flower because that

124
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:59,010
way you can lure the bee to

125
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:00,480
the flower and i shit on that

126
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,700
yeah anyway it was kind of dramatic

127
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,560
but everything was fine but it's one

128
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,060
of those flowers that squirts water so

129
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:07,140
that when it lands on it you

130
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:08,880
just scored it to be as humiliate

131
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:10,770
oh that's funny and should shrink down

132
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:14,310
it gets even smaller than a b

133
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:17,010
what is smaller than to be nothing

134
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:19,170
i hit they have one thing why

135
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:21,930
the iodine know the idea that these

136
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:24,120
that's it that bumblebee inner they currently

137
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:28,380
thin yeah the idea that bumblebees their

138
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:30,300
big move is to sting but then

139
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:31,920
they it kills them i know like

140
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:32,130
there's

141
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,480
just die away but is that not

142
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,250
true of all these no i don't

143
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:37,050
think so really i felt all bees

144
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:39,690
yellow jackets continue and be like huh

145
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:41,280
i sort of think that's why it

146
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,600
was a yellow jacket that i killed

147
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:43,830
in my home recently

148
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:46,860
um because it looks different that's really

149
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:48,780
evil it had a really evil advocating

150
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:51,480
yellow i'm gonna chemical what a yellow

151
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,890

00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:20,030
now i made a wooden sudoku what

342
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:21,950
about those those puzzles you know where

343
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:23,960
there it's eight things in a nine

344
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:25,610
whole thing and you you know slide

345
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:26,510
puzzle you

346
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:27,950
know what i like has been there's

347
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:29,180
there's a game that we have that's

348
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:30,440
really fun i would like to recommend

349
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,720
it it's called color coup and it's

350
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,640
like sudoku but colors so it's it's

351
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,090
basically a it's a i'm gonna be

352
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:42,260
like i explained baseball it's a wooden

353
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:44,750
tray that has little scooped out little

354
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:46,700
divots and we're basically where

355
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:47,780
there'd be a number on a stoke

356
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:49,520
ooh there's a hole and you put

357
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,900
a colored ball and you can't have

358
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,160
the same color going in the st

359
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,420
you know i mean the same amount

360
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:55,850
of squares xo so it's very yeah

361
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:58,220
sleeper per box yes and then nine

362
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:00,710
boxes interesting and it's really fun i

363
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:02,030
actually don't like sudoku but i like

364
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:05,390
this so do you start with colors

365
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:06,800
already in there or you have to

366
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:08,510
you have to construct hey it gives

367
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:10,190
you puzzles so like you have to

368
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:11,150
set it up to look like the

369
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:12,530
picture and then you have to solve

370
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:14,750
it now i wasn't listening to how

371
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:15,710
this game is played because i was

372
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:16,880
thinking of something else which i want

373
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,616
to share with you fine this was

374
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:20,480
a thing that i forgot to include

375
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,240
in the description of finnish baseball okay

376
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:24,530
which is this is while from a

377
00:12:24,530 --> 00:12:27,020
previous episode yes which episodes were so

378
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:27,950
a little business

379
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:31,160
so the the batting helmets that they

380
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,290
wear look like the helmets that they

381
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:34,940
put on babies when their heads need

382
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:38,600
to be reshaped in finland yeah wow

383
00:12:38,629 --> 00:12:40,940
maybe they all i mean finland maybe

384
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:43,010
they know hotheads and generals maybe they

385
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:44,210
know more about how it should really

386
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:45,650
be it's part of their national identity

387
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:46,070
yeah

388
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:48,380
if you're listening to us region and

389
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:49,490
we just hit

390
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:53,120
i don't apologize for my accent work

391
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,535
which was flawless i'm assuming yeah

392
00:12:56,990 --> 00:12:59,300
um what are you thinking about color

393
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:02,360
cu why do you like that instead

394
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,040
of sudoku because it's colors instead of

395
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,210
numbers that's the only thing i don't

396
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:06,350
know for some reason well i've never

397
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:08,244
really i've only tried to doku a

398
00:13:08,244 --> 00:13:09,740
couple times and felt very like i

399
00:13:09,770 --> 00:13:11,112
don't really get what i'm doing here

400
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:12,650
messing it up it's the exact same

401
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:14,390
as color i know but i actually

402
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:15,710
i was looking at color coup yesterday

403
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:17,150
going maybe i would be good at

404
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:18,440
sudoku if i could do this you

405
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,090
probably would because it's not edition or

406
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:21,845
anything like that it's literally just and

407
00:13:21,845 --> 00:13:23,090
i mean exactly what you're doing with

408
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:25,340
it is it's just that um sudoku

409
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:27,500
numbers yeah yeah but you're not adding

410
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,270
them together you have never seen one

411
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:30,860
of each in each row and and

412
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,570
and align or whatever you call it

413
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,700
yeah up in each box in each

414
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:35,420
line

415
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:39,380
vertically and horizontally horizontally ammo boxes lines

416
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:41,768

417
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:43,430
inches which one would you prefer they

418
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:43,580

419
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:47,210
boxes i think the boxes yeah i

420
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:48,110

contained you know and it's like it

422
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,440
makes me feel bad for the numbers

423
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:56,870

the pandemic actually did you really yeah

495
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:20,510
how did you do we got we

496
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:21,440

00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,430
them all and we knew where all

498
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:23,540
the states work because there are some

499
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:24,740

it would be an illustration and then

510
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:46,430
like a little sentence that was like

511
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:49,220

00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,510
font family like a friend it was

563
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:41,030

for the listener is about talking about

569

this before sorry take a break take

570
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:55,610
a breather fanatical break two minutes oh

571
00:18:55,610 --> 00:18:56,840
i'm assuming it will be two minutes

572
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,400
it was a way of counting room

573
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,110
and it's the way we know which

574
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:01,340
is and bob

575
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:04,700
like you would put your hands on

576
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:06,410
the table and somebody would give you

577
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:10,250
like a long multiplication or am i

578
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:11,840
just like a long math problem like

579
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:14,300
this times this minus this divided by

580
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:16,610
this whatever and so these kids would

581
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:19,040
be like tapping their fingers on the

582
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:21,200
tables on the table to come up

583
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,700
with the answer i never quite

584
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:25,400
understood how it worked but it was

585
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,960
a very brief thing that was supposed

586
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,420
to like like the the commercial was

587
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,130
as if this is gonna revolution like

588
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:33,740
revolutionize yeah and it did not really

589
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:35,680
catch on i sort of remember this

590
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,370
and the tapping of the fingers was

591
00:19:37,370 --> 00:19:38,480
part of it of like okay if

592
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,880
you tap this because you have ten

593
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,860
fingers usually well eight

594
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:44,870
in to play the muncie covers alright

595
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:46,010
yeah we go through you're taking a

596
00:19:46,012 --> 00:19:47,480

612
00:20:22,945 --> 00:20:25,885

we have to take a break by

622
00:20:55,105 --> 00:20:57,925
i am her back and me thinking

623
00:20:57,925 --> 00:21:00,355
about that animal making me think ego

624
00:21:00,355 --> 00:21:02,626
by edible book reminds me of z

625
00:21:02,626 --> 00:21:04,315
zebra in remind me of when i

626
00:21:04,795 --> 00:21:06,355
when when i went to the doctor

627
00:21:06,355 --> 00:21:09,022
with my mother and this doctor it

628
00:21:09,022 --> 00:21:12,805
was a children's doctor and pediatrician pediatrician

629
00:21:12,805 --> 00:21:13,165
sure good

630
00:21:13,225 --> 00:21:14,935
one had a ton it like you'd

631
00:21:14,937 --> 00:21:17,125
go in every office had paintings of

632
00:21:17,125 --> 00:21:19,585
zebras for some reason i guess because

633
00:21:19,585 --> 00:21:21,565
their women delay you to delight you

634
00:21:21,775 --> 00:21:23,095
but they were not delightful they were

635
00:21:23,095 --> 00:21:26,695
not like fun children's pictures like brightly

636
00:21:26,695 --> 00:21:28,615
colored they were like literally like oil

637
00:21:28,615 --> 00:21:32,905
painting like well-done paintings of zebras and

638
00:21:32,905 --> 00:21:33,385
stuff like that

639
00:21:33,385 --> 00:21:34,915
that you know like it sounds nice

640
00:21:35,455 --> 00:21:38,035
so and you're complaining so i just

641
00:21:38,065 --> 00:21:40,555
remember well done i think kids would

642
00:21:40,555 --> 00:21:42,205
say to the doctor sir well done

643
00:21:42,235 --> 00:21:43,405
these are actually these are not like

644
00:21:43,405 --> 00:21:45,475
for the high level really for a

645
00:21:45,475 --> 00:21:46,945
higher level these are wasted on me

646
00:21:46,945 --> 00:21:47,425
frankly

647
00:21:48,625 --> 00:21:50,305
but i just remember we waited so

648
00:21:50,305 --> 00:21:51,385
long for the doctor that i was

649
00:21:51,385 --> 00:21:53,545
trying to come up with riddles and

650
00:21:53,545 --> 00:21:55,525

651
00:21:55,525 --> 00:21:58,075
hard oh because like and i remember

652
00:21:58,075 --> 00:22:00,535
one of them being um why did

653
00:22:00,535 --> 00:22:02,335
the because it was some zebras going

654
00:22:02,335 --> 00:22:03,985
on probably noah's ark or whatever they

655
00:22:03,985 --> 00:22:05,065
were like going up a ramp on

656
00:22:05,065 --> 00:22:06,265

657
00:22:06,265 --> 00:22:07,945

like cyprus and that's it so like

662
00:22:17,275 --> 00:22:18,685

664
00:22:19,795 --> 00:22:22,045

for calculating math coaches

677
00:22:50,485 --> 00:22:53,395
korean word which means finger calculation oh

678
00:22:53,455 --> 00:22:55,045

679
00:22:55,045 --> 00:22:56,875

and two i feel like i did

686
00:23:12,865 --> 00:23:14,485
this i figured it out or something

687
00:23:14,635 --> 00:23:15,655
i just when i was a kid

688
00:23:15,685 --> 00:23:17,665
you never figured this out plus can

689
00:23:17,665 --> 00:23:18,717
i see the video while you play

690
00:23:18,717 --> 00:23:21,655
it minus twelve i feel like this

691
00:23:21,655 --> 00:23:24,595
is also based on blackjack card counties

692
00:23:26,485 --> 00:23:27,955
yeah how card counting is like it's

693
00:23:27,955 --> 00:23:29,755
not like you're sitting there going like

694
00:23:30,175 --> 00:23:32,785
oh ah four queens three a's yeah

00:23:33,925 --> 00:23:35,485
card counting war it's like don't either

697
00:23:35,485 --> 00:23:37,945
rain man it's a math fucking god

698
00:23:37,945 --> 00:23:39,835

the floor you freak shit yeah definitely

700
00:23:42,565 --> 00:23:43,045

all the time i'd never quite i

706
00:23:55,345 --> 00:23:56,785
think the reason i don't understand is

707
00:23:56,785 --> 00:23:59,095
because i immediately glaze over when it's

708
00:23:59,095 --> 00:24:01,735

the problem you're the end of the

788
00:26:40,285 --> 00:26:41,965
day but here's what it is is

789
00:26:41,965 --> 00:26:44,335
what the answer is no because you

790
00:26:44,335 --> 00:26:45,475
because you're still adding it up at

791
00:26:45,475 --> 00:26:47,365
the end of the fucking day you're

792
00:26:47,515 --> 00:26:49,555
going ten plus years i think it

793
00:26:49,555 --> 00:26:51,415
means like one finger is like the

794
00:26:51,415 --> 00:26:51,835

795
00:26:51,865 --> 00:26:53,155

that's in the tens this is how

800
00:27:02,005 --> 00:27:03,504
they get you to admit if because

801
00:27:03,504 --> 00:27:05,845
it starts arguments yes if you ain't

802
00:27:05,845 --> 00:27:07,285

thinking you're absolutely right i mean i

1722
00:58:57,390 --> 00:58:59,790

it's actually easier

1724
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:03,450

1726
00:59:08,189 --> 00:59:10,200
look like when they build your business

1727
00:59:10,530 --> 00:59:12,120
then you can't fucking turn around and

1728
00:59:12,120 --> 00:59:13,980
slave them treat them like children fuck

1729
00:59:13,985 --> 00:59:15,450

1737
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:30,450
is figure out a way to build

1738
00:59:30,450 --> 00:59:33,120

you agree that you work there no

1796
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,190
so you disagree that you didn't work

01:01:30,190 --> 01:01:34,451
there no so you agree to disagree

1798
01:01:34,451 --> 01:01:34,570
that

1799
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:36,310

your hot dog business yes yes we

1816
01:02:13,210 --> 01:02:14,830
sell hotdogs i think

1817
01:02:15,130 --> 01:02:16,720
it would be instructional for us to

1818
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:18,400
know how many you sold per year

1819
01:02:18,460 --> 01:02:19,780
that's right it's a crime it is

1820
01:02:19,780 --> 01:02:21,460
a crime and it's also very safe

1821
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:23,320
so you did steal hot dogs and

1822
01:02:23,320 --> 01:02:24,970
you got away with it that's right

1823
01:02:25,030 --> 01:02:27,100
i want hot dogs then have i

1824
01:02:27,100 --> 01:02:29,590
said that you kind of implied that

1825
01:02:29,590 --> 01:02:30,670
you could get us out did i

1826
01:02:30,670 --> 01:02:32,710
say that yes you i mean you

1827
01:02:32,710 --> 01:02:34,570
may as well have is that what

1828
01:02:34,570 --> 01:02:34,990
i said

1829
01:02:35,260 --> 01:02:37,720
it's heavily implied in what you did

1830
01:02:37,750 --> 01:02:39,700
what did he say he buy them

1831
01:02:40,300 --> 01:02:42,700
i mean ah yes i bought them

1832
01:02:42,700 --> 01:02:44,200
because you caught me stealing them and

1833
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:45,490
i you made me pay for them

1834
01:02:45,490 --> 01:02:47,800
but i didn't want to yes i

1835
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:49,510
would also buy them i would buy

1836
01:02:49,510 --> 01:02:52,870
hotdogs yes a buck a shot ah

1837
01:02:52,900 --> 01:02:53,740
i feel like you can get them

1838
01:02:53,740 --> 01:02:55,150
cheaper at the market however

1839
01:02:55,210 --> 01:02:56,500
they are that's the deal a buck

1840
01:02:56,500 --> 01:02:58,090
a throw five thousand dollars split it

1841
01:02:58,090 --> 01:03:01,390
half and half if they're cooked a

1842
01:03:01,390 --> 01:03:05,500
dollar seems reasonable if they're raw i'm

1843
01:03:05,500 --> 01:03:07,510
gonna say seventy five cents yes twenty

1844
01:03:07,510 --> 01:03:09,130

premium leads that's too much for hot

dogs twenty five hundred a piece is

1848
01:03:14,230 --> 01:03:14,920
that what i said

1849
01:03:15,370 --> 01:03:17,530
it's what you literally just said twenty

1850
01:03:17,530 --> 01:03:18,850
