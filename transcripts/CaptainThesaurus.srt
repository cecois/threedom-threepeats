00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:46,710
the rules of what we could do

277
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:49,860

alright and i've never any complaints but

282
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,470
the one thing was the story is

283
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,280
unseemly

284
00:10:01,227 --> 00:10:04,065
let's say it was a tangent you

285
00:10:04,065 --> 00:10:06,315
want yeah like wage anyway it's your

286
00:10:06,315 --> 00:10:08,506
story your mom did judge it just

287
00:10:08,506 --> 00:10:11,085
said it's a tangent doesn't the story

288
00:10:11,439 --> 00:10:14,175
hasn't started what's happening within that tangent

289
00:10:14,955 --> 00:10:17,955
and describing you're just a tangent oh

290
00:10:17,955 --> 00:10:19,965
is a tangent he's off the hook

291
00:10:20,196 --> 00:10:21,255
taking a stab at it

292
00:10:21,315 --> 00:10:22,815
it's just good it's just good like

293
00:10:22,815 --> 00:10:24,525
this like never said anything

294
00:10:25,695 --> 00:10:26,955
ah

295
00:10:28,047 --> 00:10:29,517
was well received as what i'm saying

296
00:10:29,775 --> 00:10:32,955
da don't know what i'm but the

297
00:10:32,955 --> 00:10:35,205
story part is oh toys best friend

298
00:10:35,205 --> 00:10:35,625
jumped on the

299
00:10:37,515 --> 00:10:40,155
the story part is that i found

300
00:10:40,155 --> 00:10:41,595
out they that she wasn't allowed to

301
00:10:41,595 --> 00:10:43,845

302
00:10:44,085 --> 00:10:45,735

talked about this we have yes well

304
00:10:48,015 --> 00:10:49,305
to me but it reminded me of

305
00:10:49,305 --> 00:10:51,135
your story about like if you're bored

306
00:10:51,675 --> 00:10:53,595
so she threw money i'm saying yeah

307
00:10:53,604 --> 00:10:54,735
she threw a book at me of

308
00:10:54,735 --> 00:10:56,625
like here's here's the mormon book of

309
00:10:56,625 --> 00:10:56,805
like

310
00:10:56,835 --> 00:10:57,945
things that you can do with our

311
00:10:57,956 --> 00:10:59,775
money and then we had to go

312
00:10:59,775 --> 00:11:01,905
through here's my user manual and every

313
00:11:01,905 --> 00:11:03,495
single thing was shitty and so we

314
00:11:03,495 --> 00:11:05,835
ended up not doing anything go to

315
00:11:05,835 --> 00:11:07,425
the park and look at a bird

316
00:11:07,515 --> 00:11:08,745
i mean i can think of a

317
00:11:08,745 --> 00:11:11,265
million things but they're not exciting checkers

318
00:11:12,045 --> 00:11:13,365
chess i don't think there can they

319
00:11:13,395 --> 00:11:15,045
play board games and when i say

320
00:11:15,102 --> 00:11:16,935
hey i think so can play

321
00:11:16,965 --> 00:11:20,145
cards cards probably that's more like gambling

322
00:11:20,175 --> 00:11:21,945
and as many gambit cards there's so

323
00:11:21,945 --> 00:11:23,385
many games have cards in them who

324
00:11:23,385 --> 00:11:25,095

to use the jigsaw i did i

441
00:15:26,505 --> 00:15:27,825
was that was fun i've never used

442
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:29,355
i think it's a horrible idea for

00:15:29,385 --> 00:15:31,245
seventh and eighth graders yeah we did

444
00:15:31,245 --> 00:15:34,095

show whatever got hurt from my work

446
00:15:35,715 --> 00:15:37,155
the only reason they have you do

447
00:15:37,155 --> 00:15:38,625
it is because like if you're gonna

448
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:38,805
fly

449
00:15:38,805 --> 00:15:40,515
monk then you need to have that

450
00:15:40,515 --> 00:15:41,985

451
00:15:42,075 --> 00:15:43,094

assigned class i know that's what i'm

457
00:15:52,155 --> 00:15:53,235
saying is it shouldn't be it should

458
00:15:53,235 --> 00:15:55,155

wasn't celebrating you guys moving around it

580
00:20:30,645 --> 00:20:32,205
was celebrating the fact that it's friday

581
00:20:32,325 --> 00:20:33,765
would the whole song play

582
00:20:34,935 --> 00:20:37,245
um i guess through the three minute

583
00:20:37,245 --> 00:20:40,515
passing period passing here but calling it

584
00:20:40,515 --> 00:20:41,295
that but i think what it was

585
00:20:41,355 --> 00:20:43,125
oh no songs are longer than three

586
00:20:43,125 --> 00:20:46,755
minutes passing good catch yeah they faded

587
00:20:46,755 --> 00:20:49,155
out most songs were longer than self

588
00:20:49,155 --> 00:20:51,885
imposed fame my high school on instagram

589
00:20:52,155 --> 00:20:54,613
oh um and you know weirdo but

590
00:20:54,613 --> 00:20:55,035
there was some

591
00:20:55,035 --> 00:20:56,205
some reason why i started because there

592
00:20:56,205 --> 00:20:58,605
was some connection to something but you

593
00:20:58,611 --> 00:20:59,085
went there

594
00:21:00,345 --> 00:21:01,965
but i think i think i followed

595
00:21:01,965 --> 00:21:04,005
because of a specific event or something

596
00:21:05,745 --> 00:21:07,335

the nine hundred in my class okay

624
00:21:55,515 --> 00:21:57,765
my high school does not my high

625
00:21:57,765 --> 00:21:58,905

liking guys adult

783
00:27:27,765 --> 00:27:29,625
i don't think i was pretty much

784
00:27:29,625 --> 00:27:30,645
eighteen and they didn't like me

785
00:27:31,905 --> 00:27:33,825
mainly formed human everyone i met as

786
00:27:33,825 --> 00:27:35,025
a child i made up my mind

787
00:27:35,025 --> 00:27:37,275
about there and then and now i

788
00:27:37,275 --> 00:27:38,715
feel the same way well i mean

789
00:27:38,745 --> 00:27:40,395
it's kind of true with people from

790
00:27:40,395 --> 00:27:42,075
like elementary school or something when you're

791
00:27:42,075 --> 00:27:44,625
like everyone falls into these certain categories

792
00:27:44,625 --> 00:27:46,275
and it's kinda hard to get past

793
00:27:46,275 --> 00:27:47,175
that if you were to just meet

794
00:27:47,175 --> 00:27:48,975

they would weigh you and then they

865
00:30:05,538 --> 00:30:07,485

weighed or away the way the person

869
00:30:16,215 --> 00:30:17,445
the person would do it

870
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:20,650
and the scale would be only less

871
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:23,140
disgusting yes so they so they wouldn't

872
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,370

874
00:30:26,890 --> 00:30:27,640

877
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:35,170
when you walk in or when you

878
00:30:35,170 --> 00:30:36,820
go to the table and then they

879
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,560
they determine how much you're going to

880
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:40,990
pay for your dinner that's demented

881
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:44,467
and that's so sick and they doubled

882
00:30:44,467 --> 00:30:46,150

883
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:47,518

893
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,047
yeah

894
00:31:02,530 --> 00:31:04,090

whole time everyone is on cocaine i

990

think that's it's it's like one of

991
00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:31,750
the stars of the documentary that they'd

992
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:33,970
never mentioned except al jarreau who's drunk

993
00:34:33,970 --> 00:34:36,160
off his ass yes they do call

994
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:38,230
him out for being incredibly drunk yes

995
00:34:38,950 --> 00:34:40,180

996
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:41,860
asking for more bottles of wine to

997
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:43,450

1003
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:53,920
and no one knows why he showed

1004
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,600
up that's the thing is is like

1005
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:58,180
bob dylan shouldn't be doing this and

1006
00:34:58,180 --> 00:34:59,950
he shows up and then he can't

1007
00:34:59,950 --> 00:35:02,260
sing and everyone's like what's dylan going

1008
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:04,810
to do they're like like office because

1009
00:35:04,810 --> 00:35:06,490
they don't do individual lines

1010
00:35:06,490 --> 00:35:08,380
nz i'm teddy and everyone just singing

1011
00:35:08,382 --> 00:35:09,856
together it sounds like trap first they

1012
00:35:09,856 --> 00:35:10,030
did

1013
00:35:11,590 --> 00:35:13,300
because everyone's got their work no one

1014
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:16,390
whoa because they quincy jones directed this

1015
00:35:16,390 --> 00:35:18,310
thing and he was like now we're

1016
00:35:18,310 --> 00:35:20,290
just gonna do this if you canceling

1017
00:35:20,290 --> 00:35:22,450
in this key don't sing don't like

1018
00:35:22,450 --> 00:35:24,310
take it down an octave we only

1019
00:35:24,310 --> 00:35:26,050
want the people who can stay in

1020
00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:28,060
this range yeah yeah so they're they're

1021
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:29,920
doing it piece by piece and so

1022
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,210
that's why the solo parts

1023
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:33,550
all the soul parts were at the

1024
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:35,290
end yeah so they did all the

1025
00:35:35,290 --> 00:35:36,520
solo lines and no one wants to

1026
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:38,020
give bob dylan one of these lines

1027
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:40,240
because he'll sing it poorly so then

1028
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:41,890
at the very end they're like ok

1029
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:43,780
bob what do we do with you

1030
00:35:43,810 --> 00:35:46,750

00:36:06,910 --> 00:36:08,740

last track bloviate wow that one did

1369
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:32,660
stand out but it felt pretty late

1370

in after you've done a lot of

1371
00:48:33,860 --> 00:48:35,960
so good trick paul's trick is to

1372
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:38,966
do like about ten before the real

1373
00:48:38,966 --> 00:48:40,730
one you've heard of gerald's game i

1374
00:48:40,730 --> 00:48:42,410
think and this is paul's trick

1375
00:48:43,430 --> 00:48:45,170
i loved you i've never called gerald

1376
00:48:45,230 --> 00:48:47,090

00:48:47,407 --> 00:48:49,280
sort of gerald's game no it's that

1378
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:51,110
oh my god it's the best book

1379
00:48:51,230 --> 00:48:52,790
here's what it's the best book even

1380
00:48:52,790 --> 00:48:55,940
greater movie what happens is you and

1381
00:48:55,940 --> 00:48:58,160
your spouse go to a way your

1382
00:48:58,190 --> 00:48:59,750
your marriage is upgrade so you can

1383
00:48:59,750 --> 00:49:01,460
go to a movie and you just

1384
00:49:01,460 --> 00:49:02,750
think there's cure

1385
00:49:03,980 --> 00:49:05,690
so you go to a remote cabin

1386
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:07,130
and you decide this is the time

1387
00:49:07,130 --> 00:49:09,680
to get into vdsl so you handcuff

1388
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:11,870
your spouse to the bedpost and then

1389
00:49:11,870 --> 00:49:13,100
you have a heart attack on top

1390
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:14,780
of them oh ca then a dog

1391
00:49:14,780 --> 00:49:16,700
eats part of you and then you

1392
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:18,920
hallucinate a gigantic man and it turns
