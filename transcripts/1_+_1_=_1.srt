another podcast i believe this is my

118
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:28,140
third podcast of the day just to

119
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:31,380
be forth and i just did a

120
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:33,570
little bit of improvisation oh so a

121
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:35,642
little too vulnerable right now i mean

122
00:04:35,642 --> 00:04:35,760
it's

123
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:38,370
it's tough coming down from grand outcast

124
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:40,050
appear appearance coming off that high is

125
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:42,870
like nothing i've ever experienced mean you're

126
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:44,310
just you're just high it's why i'm

127
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:47,471
always chasing the high it's the toxic

128
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:51,150
any medium it truly is unlike anything

129
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:54,180
else unlike anything or radio i guess

130
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:55,320
now

131
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:58,200
it's just like radio because radio you

132
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,990
have to do radio you're censored by

133
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:02,610
the man you're wants to talk about

134
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:04,740
radio you're doing those ads you know

135
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,840
for the local car dealership or whatever

136
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,700
and he's like lip it's all like

137
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:11,730

yeah what about him

314
00:11:00,985 --> 00:11:02,035
first of all you didn't think one

315
00:11:02,035 --> 00:11:04,105
plus one equal to know he was

316
00:11:04,105 --> 00:11:06,481
mistaken about that yeah i know why

317
00:11:06,481 --> 00:11:08,155
why did he say he said when

318
00:11:08,155 --> 00:11:09,865
you really think about a oneplus one

319
00:11:09,865 --> 00:11:13,705
actually probably equals one when you could

320
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:15,445
and he had like a piece of

321
00:11:15,445 --> 00:11:18,775
sculpture in his house that that illustrated

322
00:11:18,775 --> 00:11:20,275
the fact somebody like did you even

323
00:11:20,298 --> 00:11:21,925
did anyone ever go to one piece

324
00:11:21,925 --> 00:11:24,205
of sculpture and go named one plus

325
00:11:24,205 --> 00:11:25,645
one's know you had a whole theory

326
00:11:25,645 --> 00:11:27,655
about it he was like when you

327
00:11:27,655 --> 00:11:29,635
really really take a look at it

328
00:11:29,695 --> 00:11:31,345

329
00:11:31,345 --> 00:11:33,205

all of it yeah that's fine

379
00:13:12,895 --> 00:13:15,295

where it's like you gotta play new

381
00:13:17,515 --> 00:13:20,455
rules so to say come on chevron

382
00:13:21,505 --> 00:13:23,005
i think if your partner makes you

383
00:13:23,005 --> 00:13:24,985
feel bad for taking a shit you

384
00:13:24,985 --> 00:13:27,325

385
00:13:27,325 --> 00:13:29,605

daddy monsters

561
00:19:13,075 --> 00:19:14,695
one i did a table read with

562
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:16,885
billy crystal from new movie he was

563
00:19:16,885 --> 00:19:17,845
doing and i don't know if it

564
00:19:17,845 --> 00:19:20,515
ever happened picture what is going to

565
00:19:20,515 --> 00:19:22,315
be in it but um i was

566
00:19:22,315 --> 00:19:22,858
just there for

567
00:19:22,945 --> 00:19:25,105
table explain why anyone would ever do

568
00:19:25,105 --> 00:19:26,335
a table read for a movie that

569
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:27,625
you are not going to be in

570
00:19:27,655 --> 00:19:30,145
well because because i can't say have

571
00:19:30,145 --> 00:19:31,345
it first of all well why they

572
00:19:31,345 --> 00:19:32,845
have is because they want to hear

573
00:19:32,845 --> 00:19:34,435
it out loud here and they don't

574
00:19:34,435 --> 00:19:35,395
know who they're going to cast but

575
00:19:35,395 --> 00:19:36,985
then that i've never understood why an

576
00:19:36,985 --> 00:19:38,695
actor would glance oh my i would

577
00:19:38,695 --> 00:19:39,955
do it yeah oh because then i

578
00:19:39,955 --> 00:19:40,975
get to meet all these people like

579
00:19:40,975 --> 00:19:42,238
for me it's good because i then

580
00:19:42,238 --> 00:19:43,075
i got to meet billy chris

581
00:19:43,105 --> 00:19:43,945
i'll show him that i did a

582
00:19:43,945 --> 00:19:45,055
good job so and if it ever

583
00:19:45,055 --> 00:19:46,195
comes up that there is some other

584
00:19:46,195 --> 00:19:47,455
thing maybe they'll think of me but

585
00:19:47,455 --> 00:19:49,045
that's the weird part it's like all

586
00:19:49,045 --> 00:19:51,025
these actors go to these table reads

587
00:19:51,295 --> 00:19:53,575
and do these parts under the under

588
00:19:53,605 --> 00:19:55,825
the knowing they know that they're not

589
00:19:55,825 --> 00:19:57,385
going to get these roles no surrender

590
00:19:57,385 --> 00:20:00,115
that knowing but the thing is maybe

591
00:20:00,115 --> 00:20:02,335
they make an impression on somebody owning

592
00:20:02,335 --> 00:20:03,235
my god homes and wants

593
00:20:03,275 --> 00:20:04,765
from being in the table read and

594
00:20:04,765 --> 00:20:05,395
how did that work

595
00:20:08,665 --> 00:20:11,605
zoos do not affect my page yeah

596
00:20:11,635 --> 00:20:13,435

thoughts on scott well i have my

687
00:23:06,705 --> 00:23:09,735
my my stance of being supportive it's

688
00:23:09,735 --> 00:23:13,605
very specific um i think i think

689
00:23:13,605 --> 00:23:15,615

690
00:23:15,915 --> 00:23:17,055
well when he chooses to be he

691
00:23:17,055 --> 00:23:17,625
he wants

692
00:23:18,735 --> 00:23:19,515
and i choose to do it all

693
00:23:19,515 --> 00:23:21,405
the time god is very supportive he

694
00:23:21,405 --> 00:23:22,845
i remember him say i remember him

695
00:23:22,845 --> 00:23:25,065
saying that he's on on his show

696
00:23:25,065 --> 00:23:26,985
he said i will text people to

697
00:23:26,985 --> 00:23:28,125
say they did a good job in

698
00:23:28,125 --> 00:23:31,305
something if i've see it um but

699
00:23:31,365 --> 00:23:33,075
ah he doesn't that doesn't mean he

700
00:23:33,075 --> 00:23:35,355
sees everything know that a person can't

701
00:23:35,355 --> 00:23:37,275
see everything but it's always ah if

702
00:23:37,275 --> 00:23:38,895
i ever see a friend in ah

703
00:23:38,955 --> 00:23:40,905
tv show or movie i'll usually text

704
00:23:40,905 --> 00:23:42,165
them right away to say hey you

705
00:23:42,195 --> 00:23:43,725
good job i do that is me

706
00:23:43,725 --> 00:23:45,615
too and i also like going on

707
00:23:45,615 --> 00:23:47,055
my way to watch people on stuff

708
00:23:47,055 --> 00:23:47,895
and i feel like there are a

709
00:23:47,895 --> 00:23:49,095
lot of people in our community who

710
00:23:49,155 --> 00:23:51,015
actively don't yes i think you and

711
00:23:51,015 --> 00:23:52,815
i probably watch people we know and

712
00:23:52,815 --> 00:23:55,425
stuff because nothing gets neat yes like

713
00:23:55,425 --> 00:23:57,495
there's no single episode of lucifer oh

714
00:23:57,495 --> 00:23:58,605
my god i thought that was so

715
00:23:58,605 --> 00:23:59,055
funny wah

716
00:23:59,055 --> 00:24:00,757
it's that you are lucifer i'm like

717
00:24:00,832 --> 00:24:02,175
wait did i see that i don't

718
00:24:02,175 --> 00:24:04,065
know i think i did honestly honestly

719
00:24:04,065 --> 00:24:05,415
one of the weirdest things i've aged

720
00:24:05,415 --> 00:24:07,365
on totally worth checking out extreme i

721
00:24:07,365 --> 00:24:08,835
think i fast forward it's a strange

722
00:24:08,835 --> 00:24:10,305
thing i fast forwarded through the show

723
00:24:10,305 --> 00:24:11,295
until you were on and then i

724
00:24:11,295 --> 00:24:11,955
watched your scenes

725
00:24:13,005 --> 00:24:13,995
yeah that's me too

726
00:24:15,615 --> 00:24:18,225
i mean no i didn't um well

727
00:24:18,225 --> 00:24:20,865
i will say when i first started

728
00:24:20,865 --> 00:24:22,155
in the nineties it was more of

729
00:24:22,155 --> 00:24:23,805
a thrill to see someone that we

730
00:24:23,805 --> 00:24:25,125
knew on t i'd be like oh

731
00:24:25,125 --> 00:24:26,235
my god i know that person new

732
00:24:26,235 --> 00:24:27,915
members people are also getting their first

733
00:24:27,915 --> 00:24:29,745
job never stops him at this point

734
00:24:29,745 --> 00:24:31,905
it's like you know i mean i

735
00:24:31,905 --> 00:24:33,285

00:24:40,995 --> 00:24:42,495
especially because they're clearly doing better than

741
00:24:42,495 --> 00:24:43,485
you yeah exact well

742
00:24:44,985 --> 00:24:46,215
no i mean it's great but it's

743
00:24:46,215 --> 00:24:47,805
like yeah yeah i see people i

744
00:24:47,805 --> 00:24:48,976
know on tv lol but yeah yeah

745
00:24:48,976 --> 00:24:50,265
i remember like the first times i

746
00:24:50,265 --> 00:24:52,035
would see people like from io and

747
00:24:52,035 --> 00:24:53,565
chicago like in a commercial and i'd

748
00:24:53,565 --> 00:24:55,275
be like whoa i still like i

749
00:24:55,275 --> 00:24:56,985
do in privatizing a commercial like it

750
00:24:56,985 --> 00:24:58,335
really started to make it the business

751
00:24:58,335 --> 00:24:59,655
like make more sense to me too

752
00:24:59,805 --> 00:25:02,025
i could understand like how the path

753
00:25:02,055 --> 00:25:04,245
can that made you understand commercials

754
00:25:04,845 --> 00:25:05,835
i never knew what was happening in

755
00:25:05,835 --> 00:25:08,265
those these little tiny movies no but

756
00:25:08,265 --> 00:25:10,245
i never understood oh who was in

757
00:25:10,245 --> 00:25:11,955
them or how this was happening and

758
00:25:11,955 --> 00:25:14,115
then it's like i started to understand

759
00:25:14,115 --> 00:25:16,365
you do commercial auditions know i used

760
00:25:16,365 --> 00:25:18,225
to i used to too they're such

761
00:25:18,255 --> 00:25:19,935
a drag there really are some of

762
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:21,765
them mean people actually just talked about

763
00:25:21,765 --> 00:25:23,325
yeah this it's really just a tv

764
00:25:23,325 --> 00:25:24,975
with just chaffin but the

765
00:25:24,975 --> 00:25:26,325
the we were going off about it

766
00:25:26,325 --> 00:25:29,025
because they are some truly the casting

767
00:25:29,025 --> 00:25:30,980
people not the casting director i don't

768
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:32,385
know excretion never in the audition the

769
00:25:32,415 --> 00:25:34,035
people running the additions are usually the

770
00:25:34,095 --> 00:25:35,685
meanest people and they want you to

771
00:25:35,685 --> 00:25:37,035
feel dumb and they want you to

772
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:38,595
feel bad and the wardrobe people want

773
00:25:38,595 --> 00:25:39,615
you to feel ugly and we are

774
00:25:39,615 --> 00:25:41,655
near bodies wrong yeah and they and

775
00:25:41,655 --> 00:25:43,065
like i'm sure there are exceptions but

776
00:25:43,095 --> 00:25:45,135
i don't think i've met it's because

777
00:25:45,135 --> 00:25:47,325
cause it's all the all the um

778
00:25:47,535 --> 00:25:49,515
the pretense of art is stripped away

779
00:25:49,695 --> 00:25:51,465
now it's just commerce yeah it's like

780
00:25:51,525 --> 00:25:52,635
oh yeah what does what does your

781
00:25:52,635 --> 00:25:53,685
look we don't have to pretend we

782
00:25:53,685 --> 00:25:55,815
like you know right you're staying out

783
00:25:55,848 --> 00:25:58,395
here idiot yeah yeah i went to

784
00:25:59,385 --> 00:26:01,455
i went to an audition once where

785
00:26:01,455 --> 00:26:02,865
i had this was after i said

786
00:26:02,865 --> 00:26:04,635
i wasn't gonna do commercial auditions anymore

787
00:26:04,635 --> 00:26:05,205
for that

788
00:26:05,415 --> 00:26:07,545
very reason i never and it was

789
00:26:07,545 --> 00:26:09,375
like it was like i was booking

790
00:26:09,375 --> 00:26:11,895
stuff like my wife goes on commercial

791
00:26:11,895 --> 00:26:15,495
dishes sure she comes to me no

792
00:26:15,555 --> 00:26:17,595
but she but she books e-commerce yeah

793
00:26:17,745 --> 00:26:19,125
i got a much thicker skin about

794
00:26:19,125 --> 00:26:20,685
that study say something to the effect

795
00:26:20,685 --> 00:26:22,155
of like unless you're in a groove

796
00:26:22,215 --> 00:26:23,445
like a lot of people we knew

797
00:26:23,445 --> 00:26:25,215
would get into like every commercial yeah

798
00:26:25,245 --> 00:26:25,411
for

799
00:26:25,455 --> 00:26:26,745
a couple of years ago yeah their

800
00:26:26,745 --> 00:26:29,115
face was too recognisable but um they

801
00:26:29,115 --> 00:26:30,465
say it's like one out of every

802
00:26:30,495 --> 00:26:33,855
hundred of auditions maybe is that's that's

803
00:26:33,855 --> 00:26:35,445
how often you would book something and

804
00:26:35,445 --> 00:26:36,195
i was like i don't have that

805
00:26:36,195 --> 00:26:37,605
kind of time because there's a million

806
00:26:37,605 --> 00:26:39,195
people going out for them yeah and

807
00:26:39,225 --> 00:26:41,805
and also they're very they're very finicky

808
00:26:41,805 --> 00:26:43,755
about what look they want or whatever

809
00:26:43,785 --> 00:26:45,135
and all these different people have a

810
00:26:45,138 --> 00:26:45,615
say

811
00:26:45,615 --> 00:26:47,115
a in it and it's it's a

812
00:26:47,115 --> 00:26:48,945
mess so i went in when you

813
00:26:48,945 --> 00:26:50,055
do one by the way not to

814
00:26:50,055 --> 00:26:51,255
interrupt but when you do what you

815
00:26:51,255 --> 00:26:53,805
did there are twenty people who all

816
00:26:53,805 --> 00:26:55,665
have that say i wanted guys don't

817
00:26:55,665 --> 00:26:57,465
have heavy and they're all staring at

818
00:26:57,465 --> 00:26:59,235
you like you're doing a terrible job

819
00:26:59,235 --> 00:27:01,095
and yeah the wrong choice yeah and

820
00:27:01,095 --> 00:27:03,045
they're they're not there's nothing about it

821
00:27:03,045 --> 00:27:04,575
that's supportive like when you're in there

822
00:27:04,575 --> 00:27:05,235
in the room

823
00:27:05,955 --> 00:27:08,625
the the early spring conversations yes oh

824
00:27:08,625 --> 00:27:10,245
it's usually very just you go in

825
00:27:10,245 --> 00:27:12,585
for theatrical audition that everyone's there once

826
00:27:12,615 --> 00:27:14,415
you to do well yeah there are

827
00:27:14,415 --> 00:27:16,095
at least not slow down the production

828
00:27:16,125 --> 00:27:17,745
yeah but they're and they're giving you

829
00:27:17,745 --> 00:27:19,635
like they're giving you space to do

830
00:27:19,635 --> 00:27:21,525
your best gotten the material in advance

831
00:27:21,529 --> 00:27:22,819
most of the time yes whereas with

832
00:27:22,819 --> 00:27:24,255
a commercial edition you just walk in

833
00:27:24,255 --> 00:27:25,815
and maybe read off a board

834
00:27:25,965 --> 00:27:27,195
yeah and they're supposed to do it

835
00:27:27,195 --> 00:27:28,905
naturally or you're just supposed to like

836
00:27:28,935 --> 00:27:30,525
note do a bunch of weird actions

837
00:27:30,525 --> 00:27:32,445
with no props or eat something that's

838
00:27:32,445 --> 00:27:34,125
like supposed to be something else like

839
00:27:34,155 --> 00:27:36,165
eat this bun but yeah it's like

840
00:27:36,645 --> 00:27:39,645
fucking orange teller mime a weird thing

841
00:27:39,645 --> 00:27:42,255
like extremely specific thing yeah reminds me

842
00:27:42,255 --> 00:27:43,365
that's like really physical and hard to

843
00:27:43,365 --> 00:27:45,375
do by yourself because yes not real

844
00:27:45,375 --> 00:27:46,095
and i also carry

845
00:27:46,095 --> 00:27:47,865
and they pair you up with yeah

846
00:27:47,895 --> 00:27:50,295
people and a stranger a stranger and

847
00:27:50,295 --> 00:27:51,465
you have to pretend you've been married

848
00:27:51,465 --> 00:27:52,995
for twenty years so anytime i watch

849
00:27:52,995 --> 00:27:54,555
a commercial now and there's people who

850
00:27:54,555 --> 00:27:55,785
are like arm and arm and going

851
00:27:55,965 --> 00:27:57,645
well when i well we thought and

852
00:27:57,645 --> 00:27:59,445
it's always strangers yeah and that's just

853
00:27:59,475 --> 00:28:01,245
banking oh what were they talking about

854
00:28:01,245 --> 00:28:04,838
between right takes yeah anyway so yes

855
00:28:04,838 --> 00:28:06,255

857
00:28:07,305 --> 00:28:10,095
request from ah you know my agent

the star of this campaign and so

865
00:28:23,175 --> 00:28:24,915

1044
00:34:33,170 --> 00:34:35,840
when i drive i there and the

1045
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:38,420
our local post office they don't go

1046
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:40,340

ever damn okay they change the in

1049
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:48,200
and the out of the parking lot

1050
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:52,610
why because it was it was illogical

1051
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:55,910
okay it was that the um the

1052
00:34:55,970 --> 00:34:58,640
inn was on the far side of

1053
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,626
the lot and the bulgari larger stores

1054
00:35:00,626 --> 00:35:00,950
it's like

1055
00:35:01,610 --> 00:35:03,290
yes it was a cow standing on

1056
00:35:03,290 --> 00:35:04,220
his hind legs directly

1057
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:06,710
the cat was wearing glasses of course

1058
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:09,980
um that if you are driving towards

1059
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:12,740
it um you had to go past

1060
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:15,170
the the out to get to the

1061
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,880
inn and so it caused a lot

1062
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:19,880
of consternation because a lot of consternation

1063
00:35:20,390 --> 00:35:23,450
but peasants were very superstitious associates it

1064
00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:25,070
had been this way forever and so

1065
00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:25,580
even though there were

1066
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:27,680
signs all over the place people were

1067
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:30,590
going out the wrong way and and

1068
00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:31,940
going in the wrong sometimes you just

fun to do it on the computer

1199
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:22,550
didn't know exciting yeah didn't feel like

1200
00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:23,390
you're doing homework

1201
00:40:24,155 --> 00:40:25,625
some reason it always stands out that

1202
00:40:25,625 --> 00:40:27,995
i wrote this paper from in elementary

1203
00:40:27,995 --> 00:40:31,235
school about um the statue of liberty

1204
00:40:31,235 --> 00:40:35,042
or something or like something yeah it

1205
00:40:35,042 --> 00:40:36,335
was that the title of the paper

1206
00:40:36,365 --> 00:40:38,645
yeah but ah well what i loved

1207
00:40:38,645 --> 00:40:39,935
about it was that you could download

1208
00:40:39,935 --> 00:40:41,277
a picture and make and print printed

1209
00:40:41,277 --> 00:40:42,815
out and make it your co yeah

1210
00:40:42,905 --> 00:40:44,075
but i um

1211
00:40:44,855 --> 00:40:47,525
i yeah use the word emigrated instead

1212
00:40:47,525 --> 00:40:50,255
of immigrated ah causing harder kind of

1213
00:40:50,255 --> 00:40:52,085
told me to do that stupid and

1214
00:40:52,625 --> 00:40:54,725
corrected on it and i never forgot

1215
00:40:55,115 --> 00:40:57,185
for some reason and i love acknowledge

1216
00:40:57,245 --> 00:40:59,315
okay yeah tutors i well i found

1217
00:40:59,315 --> 00:41:01,025
it frustrating because and i still feel

1218
00:41:01,025 --> 00:41:03,395
confused about the difference feelings to words

1219
00:41:03,395 --> 00:41:04,445
because i do believe emma

1220
00:41:04,445 --> 00:41:06,065
great means to move somewhere to live

1221
00:41:06,065 --> 00:41:08,705
there doesn't it yeah but i think

1222
00:41:08,855 --> 00:41:13,055
one emigrates right and then and and

1223
00:41:13,055 --> 00:41:16,445
then you emigrate from a place right

1224
00:41:16,475 --> 00:41:18,395
and then emigrate means to leave one's

1225
00:41:18,395 --> 00:41:20,525
country to live in another great means

1226
00:41:20,705 --> 00:41:22,025
is to come into the country to

1227
00:41:22,025 --> 00:41:24,395
live permanently yeah right oh so emigrated

1228
00:41:24,425 --> 00:41:24,605
not

1229
00:41:24,635 --> 00:41:27,785
permanent doesn't have to be migrated to

1230
00:41:27,785 --> 00:41:29,015
move like birds in the winter the

1231
00:41:29,045 --> 00:41:31,175
christian emigrate immigrate and migrate depends on

1232
00:41:31,175 --> 00:41:34,775
the sentences point of view oh yeah

1233
00:41:34,955 --> 00:41:36,155
my teacher might have been wrong what

1234
00:41:36,155 --> 00:41:37,175
was your point of view oh i

1235
00:41:37,175 --> 00:41:38,435
hate that when teachers are wrong but

1236
00:41:38,435 --> 00:41:39,245
you know what i mean like maybe

1237
00:41:39,245 --> 00:41:40,985
my sentence actually did make sense onto

1238
00:41:40,991 --> 00:41:43,115
the computer correct today yeah i've always

1239
00:41:43,145 --> 00:41:44,465
thought about the office what statue of

1240
00:41:44,465 --> 00:41:44,765
liberty

1241
00:41:44,795 --> 00:41:46,355
i've always thought about my i think

1242
00:41:46,355 --> 00:41:48,425
i probably talks about my newspaper teacher

1243
00:41:49,005 --> 00:41:51,335

1386
00:46:35,705 --> 00:46:37,205
i'm begging to hear what you're gonna

1387
00:46:37,205 --> 00:46:39,125
say i had a teacher i thought

1388
00:46:39,125 --> 00:46:41,615
about her today my eighth grade teacher

1389
00:46:41,615 --> 00:46:43,595
was was someone that

1390
00:46:47,075 --> 00:46:48,215
huh yeah

1391
00:46:56,135 --> 00:46:58,257
hearing the words eighth gray like oh

1392
00:46:58,257 --> 00:47:01,325
okay um i follow and she was

1393
00:47:01,445 --> 00:47:05,945
very she clearly was very um when

1394
00:47:05,945 --> 00:47:06,785
i look back on it it's very

1395
00:47:06,785 --> 00:47:09,095
complicated because she's real clearly very encouraging

1396
00:47:09,095 --> 00:47:11,705
of me but we were at odds

1397
00:47:11,735 --> 00:47:13,175
all the time and she would frequently

1398
00:47:13,175 --> 00:47:14,525
make me stay after class and

1399
00:47:14,555 --> 00:47:15,485
when i think about it now i

1400
00:47:15,485 --> 00:47:16,895
can't remember why i'm sure it was

1401
00:47:16,895 --> 00:47:18,935
just like i was you know being

1402
00:47:18,935 --> 00:47:20,885
disruptive in class or talking or whatever

1403
00:47:20,885 --> 00:47:23,075
attention cool but i wasn't like

1404
00:47:24,305 --> 00:47:26,435
i wasn't like like doing shit that

1405
00:47:26,435 --> 00:47:27,365
was like look at me look at

1406
00:47:27,365 --> 00:47:28,985
me like i would make jokes or

1407
00:47:28,985 --> 00:47:31,325
whatever i loved doing that saying look

1408
00:47:31,325 --> 00:47:32,285
at me look at me you know

1409
00:47:32,559 --> 00:47:34,355
some jokes in school yeah it's the

1410
00:47:34,355 --> 00:47:36,515
best it's so fun yeah so fine

1411
00:47:36,515 --> 00:47:38,555
i guess it is maybe a desperate

1412
00:47:38,555 --> 00:47:40,805
need for attention at the core well

1413
00:47:40,835 --> 00:47:42,425
it's like if you're trailing certainly trying

1414
00:47:42,425 --> 00:47:44,165
to be liked by your appear yeah

1415
00:47:44,195 --> 00:47:44,285
you

1416
00:47:44,285 --> 00:47:45,905
no and it's like and once you

1417
00:47:45,905 --> 00:47:48,065
get a taste of it you you

1418
00:47:48,095 --> 00:47:49,715
it feels good when you're just like

1419
00:47:49,715 --> 00:47:51,665
you're getting that you're getting that that

1420
00:47:51,935 --> 00:47:53,765
approval from other people and i was

1421
00:47:53,765 --> 00:47:55,595
like oh you're also figuring out this

1422
00:47:55,595 --> 00:47:56,945
is a thing i'm good at yeah

1423
00:47:56,975 --> 00:47:59,915
you know and so i yes every

1424
00:47:59,915 --> 00:48:01,415
once in a while i probably would

1425
00:48:01,415 --> 00:48:04,415
say something out loud you know

1426
00:48:04,475 --> 00:48:05,615
to get a laugh from the whole

1427
00:48:05,615 --> 00:48:07,535
class but more often than not it

1428
00:48:07,535 --> 00:48:08,945
was just like my little group of

1429
00:48:08,945 --> 00:48:10,955
people around me or whatever right so

1430
00:48:11,735 --> 00:48:14,075
she would i remember her trying like

1431
00:48:14,075 --> 00:48:15,485
she was clearly trying to get through

1432
00:48:15,485 --> 00:48:16,835
to me like break through to me

1433
00:48:17,195 --> 00:48:18,365
but when i think about it like

1434
00:48:19,265 --> 00:48:20,495
it was there was never going to

1435
00:48:20,495 --> 00:48:22,715
work like like you're a comedian like

1436
00:48:23,195 --> 00:48:24,605
like you are born this way

1437
00:48:24,635 --> 00:48:27,005
yeah like i don't know what what

1438
00:48:27,005 --> 00:48:28,745
i think about whatever lesson it was

1439
00:48:28,745 --> 00:48:29,825
that she was trying to instill in

1440
00:48:29,825 --> 00:48:32,105
me it just didn't work yeah and

1441
00:48:32,105 --> 00:48:33,935
it was clearly never going to work

1442
00:48:33,995 --> 00:48:35,225
i know like for some reason i

1443
00:48:35,225 --> 00:48:37,235
never got punished for that even though

1444
00:48:37,235 --> 00:48:39,275
i'm sure it was annoying at times

1445
00:48:39,575 --> 00:48:41,615
but i i that's interesting i maybe

1446
00:48:41,705 --> 00:48:42,815
i wonder if it's a boy girl

1447
00:48:42,815 --> 00:48:44,225
thing where it's like they would make

1448
00:48:44,225 --> 00:48:44,765
him stay

1449
00:48:44,795 --> 00:48:45,995
after class to try to go like

1450
00:48:46,025 --> 00:48:47,825
you really shouldn't be like that right

1451
00:48:48,035 --> 00:48:49,355
it's like it almost seems like like

1452
00:48:49,355 --> 00:48:50,885
it feels like because more it seems

1453
00:48:50,885 --> 00:48:52,475
more aggressive maybe i don't know but

1454
00:48:52,475 --> 00:48:54,545
it almost seems like in a sexist

1455
00:48:54,545 --> 00:48:56,285
society that they would try to tell

1456
00:48:56,285 --> 00:48:58,115
the girl i said that's not ladylike

1457
00:48:58,115 --> 00:48:59,585
to jack to make jokes like that

1458
00:48:59,585 --> 00:49:00,785
or whatever yeah i don't know i

1459
00:49:00,785 --> 00:49:02,045
had a teacher come up to me

1460
00:49:02,345 --> 00:49:04,775
ah i think twelve years after i

1461
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:04,925
gr

1462
00:49:04,925 --> 00:49:08,285
graduated or some something like that and

1463
00:49:08,555 --> 00:49:11,495
ah knows ten years i remember because

00:49:11,495 --> 00:49:14,075

00:54:37,705 --> 00:54:40,825
five years well i don't you're not

1616
00:54:40,975 --> 00:54:42,412
a bragging type of guy

1617
00:54:42,505 --> 00:54:43,435
i didn't even know that you were

1618
00:54:43,435 --> 00:54:44,605
on it i mean you're you're very

1619
00:54:44,605 --> 00:54:46,495
humble and you you keep that information

1620
00:54:46,495 --> 00:54:48,085
really close to the vest i'm humble

1621
00:54:48,085 --> 00:54:49,525
because i don't have much to brag

1622
00:54:49,525 --> 00:54:50,875
about no you have a lot to

1623
00:54:50,875 --> 00:54:51,865
brag about that's why i'm saying i

1624
00:54:51,865 --> 00:54:53,425
had no idea that you even were

1625
00:54:53,425 --> 00:54:55,225
on this show until recently and the

1626
00:54:55,225 --> 00:54:56,695
minute i found out about i checked

1627
00:54:56,695 --> 00:54:58,135
it out and your wonderful so you

1628
00:54:58,135 --> 00:55:00,085
don't listen to me well that's what

1629
00:55:00,085 --> 00:55:01,495
i'm trying to say is you're not

1630
00:55:01,495 --> 00:55:02,635
the type of guy

1631
00:55:02,815 --> 00:55:04,435
to go out there bragging about all

1632
00:55:04,435 --> 00:55:07,465
of your accomplishments which are many so

1633
00:55:07,465 --> 00:55:09,775
i'm too good for you now yeah

1634
00:55:09,895 --> 00:55:12,535
ty actually i agree i think my

1635
00:55:12,535 --> 00:55:16,375
mistake was it creating a character for

1636
00:55:16,375 --> 00:55:17,965
scott it because then it could be

1637
00:55:18,025 --> 00:55:20,725
anything that you say would make sense

1638
00:55:21,085 --> 00:55:22,795
whereas this

1639
00:55:22,795 --> 00:55:23,965
is harder when you did a great

1640
00:55:23,965 --> 00:55:25,075
job and i think that's five or

1641
00:55:25,075 --> 00:55:27,835
six thank you um okay say so

1642
00:55:27,835 --> 00:55:29,815

1643
00:55:29,815 --> 00:55:32,785
