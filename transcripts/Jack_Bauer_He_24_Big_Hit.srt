feels unset

92
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,250
failing to me like i'd be hearing

93
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:45,630
this personal stuff so i wouldn't feel

94
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:47,370
like i was it's not so much

95
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:49,020
like oh i'm morally wrong for listening

96
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,490
to this but i would feel like

97
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:53,546
uncomfortable i think at first i under

98
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:54,600
like i felt that a little bit

99
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,340
but then it's like you hear in

100
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:57,270
case you said this too is like

101
00:03:57,270 --> 00:04:00,239

this very vividly when um you would

151
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:48,240
make a withdrawal

152
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,250

ah spikes that come out at a

157
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:02,640
parking lot yeah and um you know

158
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,440
the sign says don't backup severe tire

159
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:08,400
damage it used to say trebles cause

160
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,560
cause tire damage because those things are

161
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,750

162
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:13,980

225
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:34,050

279
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:18,510
showing disagreement with my mother even though

280
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:22,590
she's now dead about the direction of

281
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:25,260
the fan because she would say you

282
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:27,870
turn the fan outward so it sucks

283
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:29,700

00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,150
no stopping no do not pass go

294
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:57,359
rule number one yeah i don't think

295
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,370
are we talking about the nineteen hundreds

296
00:10:59,403 --> 00:11:01,021
are we talking about anything to anytime

297
00:11:01,021 --> 00:11:02,580
in history yeah i wouldn't want to

298
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:07,440
live anytime before nineteen ten probably what

299
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,180
happened in nineteen ten yeah what happened

300
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:09,360
to you

301
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:13,140
huh is it just culture now or

302
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:15,000
you know what i think about first

303
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:15,780
of all it's like you have to

304
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:18,030
be rich in any era before the

305
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:20,130
like forties probably to feel like i

306
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:21,780
was having a good time right because

307
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:23,820
like my american girl doll when i

308
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:26,130
was growing up samantha parking ten was

309
00:11:26,130 --> 00:11:28,050
from ninety no four and she was

310
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:30,270
really rich children victorian home

311
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:32,910
and her life seemed good but then

312
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:34,500
some of my other dolls from different

313
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,510
periods than iraq because they had to

314
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:38,640
make their own butter yeah make their

315
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,930
own butter i would love it if

316
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:41,640
they made like a poor doll from

317
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,260
samantha's time that smelled

318
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:46,590
i thought ditch his head permanent der

319
00:11:46,602 --> 00:11:49,230
yeah the perimeter club and i went

320
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:51,027
to the ten-minute boat the burberry and

321
00:11:51,067 --> 00:11:53,370
my raving cool up and i went

322
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:55,170
to the tenement museum in new york

323
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:58,020
city and one lower left neat one

324
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,820
factoid that i thought was very interesting

325
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,920
it was one of the reasons and

326
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,470
this is in the ah nineteen twenty

327
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:05,670
these are thirty or what have you

328
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:07,140
one of the reasons that everyone wore

329
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:08,790
hats is because people were pouring out

330
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:12,660
their bedpans out of there one second

331
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:14,070
and third and on top of the

332
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:18,180
yep that's right just they've had their

333
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:19,500
big hats on they wouldn't be covered

334
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,220
in diarrhea

335
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,660
it's his new album title um it

336
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:27,750
was definitely diarrhea but that's also everywhere

337
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,780
that is also the reason why women

338
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:32,850
ah it was polite to have women

339
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:35,430
walk on the outside like more by

340
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:37,200
the co either street so they would

341
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,150
walk on the inside you would the

342
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:41,280
gentlemen would walk on the outside but

343
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:43,080
but that but that was ah for

344
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:46,170
splashes from from like carriages and it's

345
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,580
like all sorts of thing but i

346
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:49,170
think the pouring of it they i

347
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:50,700
bring up the duty the pouring of

348
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,260
the donkey i believe when that was

349
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:54,300
very common they would switch because the

350
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,740
man would be more likely to get

351
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:57,180
it i think then they would just

352
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:57,600
like

353
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:00,330
whole lot of things so the man

354
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:02,550
we are not the same time period

355
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:05,940
you're saying that like first manners change

356
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:07,590
first it was splashes and then it's

357
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:08,910
like alright will do i'll walk on

358
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:10,140
the outside i think so that it

359
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:12,030
was pissed and shit raining down like

360
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:13,860
okay let's switch place i think reverse

361
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,360
it maybe but yeah why dump it

362
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,610
out your window how route where else

363
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:18,780
are downstairs

364
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:22,976
like it's ten stories yeah yeah yeah

365
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:25,230
if you have your whole impoverished immigrant

366
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:27,270
family and you're all sharing one bedpan

367
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:30,060

00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:32,520
imagine way okay paul you didn't answer

369
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,170

want to live ah caveman times yeah

371
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:38,370
commando

372
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:42,780
having to battle animals i think the

373
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:45,210
i think like the eighteen hundreds like

374
00:13:45,210 --> 00:13:46,500
late eighteen hundred before the turn of

375
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,810
the century because it's an age of

376
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:51,960
some enlightenment but everything is miserable and

377
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:52,980
so and you have to get the

378
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:54,390
civil war as well if you're living

379
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:55,980
in the united states and yes so

380
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:58,470
there's still like all the social horror

381
00:13:58,470 --> 00:13:59,190
that's going on

382
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:00,570
on but then on top of that

383
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,790
you have to wear like eight layers

384
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:05,970
of clothing everybody stinks there's no they're

385
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,360
yeah maybe there's everybody's stairs probably not

386
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:12,360
indoor no ma'am there's no like showers

387
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:13,920
you know what i mean so it's

388
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:15,990
it's the to me that's the worst

389
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:17,940
of everything yeah i remember the the

390
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:19,110
these books did you ever read the

391
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:19,350
great

392
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:21,300
brain series yeah when i was a

393
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:22,770
kid i was like get out yeah

394
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:24,180
okay so it was it was about

395
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:26,100
a ah a kid who was like

396
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,780
the smartest kid around it was set

397
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:30,210
in the early oof i guess the

398
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:31,530
early nineteen hundreds i believe

399
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:35,040
but the smartest kid around he was

400
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,320
he was very very skidoo around it

401
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,760
was the only bucket that's what he

402
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:39,180
saw

403
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:42,150
the sun by danny

404
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:44,100
oh man came over whenever you finish

405
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:46,620
a little man paulo talking sound anytime

406
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:47,310
you look to the cover

407
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,160
so he was he was a kid

408
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,900
who met her you would invent things

409
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,310
i believe or he would

410
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:55,710
he would hear about things like i

411
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:58,254
remember he went to school in ah

412
00:14:58,254 --> 00:15:01,230
in a ah boarding school with jesuit

413
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:03,360
priests maybe or something they were mormon

414
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,702
was maybe they were mormon yeah oh

415
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:06,210
it was in utah yeah yeah so

416
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:07,800
they were like mormon priests and so

417
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,660
he brought basketball to the school and

418
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:11,460
they they had a basketball team at

419
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:13,110
one point like you he didn't invent

420
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:14,160
it but he read about it and

421
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:14,460
he

422
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,650
he started it anyway there was ah

423
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,200
the indoor toilet book was the one

424
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,930

426
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:26,130

482
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,910
on the kitchen counter e because yeah

483
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:08,310
that's gross it's like having a toilet

484
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:10,410
in your house having a cat

485
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,200
no putting the cattle in the kitchen

486
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:14,310
count wait can i ask you guys

487
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:17,370
my question decades yeah okay what deck

488
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:18,630
if you could only listen to music

489
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:20,940
from one decade what decade would you

490
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,956
pick would it have to be ah

491
00:17:22,956 --> 00:17:25,140
a full decade of like the like

492
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:27,840
nineteen seventy to nineteen seventy nine or

493
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,040
could it be a decade of your

494
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,410
choosing like seventy six to know

495
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:34,500
i was thinking seventy to seventy nine

496
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:37,380
nothing um and you can't listen anything

497
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:39,690
before that you can't let so so

498
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:41,910
can i ask you a question would

499
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:43,920
you have been able up to this

500
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:46,320
point to have listened to anything before

501
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,720
that or would you have to knowing

502
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,340
what you know now you would go

503
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:51,750
back to the start of your life

504
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:54,930
and then choose the decade knowing what

505
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:57,660
you know now you would and then

506
00:17:57,690 --> 00:17:59,250
and then that's all you get that's

507
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:00,660
all you get okay so this point

508
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:03,360
yeah so so you would so i

509
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,370
guess my question i am working to

510
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:07,290
stop my head why would you

511
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:11,430
well no because a lot of music

512
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:13,560
is based on like oh wow this

513
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:16,620
is what the beatles did but like

514
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:19,380
inspired by old rhino enemy so so

515
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:20,850
if you if you could not listen

516
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:23,370
to the sixties music anymore right then

517
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:24,480
some of the stuff you would listen

518
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,249
to would be like insane because you

519
00:18:26,249 --> 00:18:27,570
you wouldn't have that basis of no

520
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:28,230
you know

521
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:30,900
what you like i'm just saying what

522
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:32,578
era would like if we don't say

523
00:18:32,578 --> 00:18:33,870
you have been able to listen to

524
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:36,060
the sexual like is you yeah and

525
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:38,160
you know everything you know okay and

526
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,470
then now i see you mentally okay

527
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:42,780
that's that is my question yeah but

528
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:46,050
but he got it okay but so

529
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,390
if you if in this

530
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:51,480
scenario where you go back to the

531
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,400
beginning of your life and the only

532
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,780
music you know is from these ten

533
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:55,440
years right

534
00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:58,800
what didn't seem weird nothing would seem

535
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,133
weird i don't know because i think

536
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,210
that would be all of music that

537
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:04,620
would just be what music was no

538
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:05,880
no well it had it would have

539
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:09,510
to be with whatever is released in

540
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:11,310
in those that day yeah right so

541
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:12,570
but you would get that no matter

542
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:15,300
when your born or whatever you in

543
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:16,680
your mind that's all music

544
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:18,060
you get to listen to is from

545
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:19,554
whatever and but you also it doesn't

546
00:19:19,554 --> 00:19:20,760
matter when you are born all of

547
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,560

551
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:31,680
i'm locked in i'm locked into

552
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,400
london i've had to think about that

553
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,500
yeah i guess admired by those thinking

554
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:39,090
this is all the music that there

555
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:41,310

578
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:32,970

explain yourself i believe that girl smells

586
00:20:51,635 --> 00:20:53,765
spleen yourself my favorite period of music

587
00:20:53,765 --> 00:20:54,785
is seventy six

588
00:20:54,785 --> 00:20:56,885
six to maybe eighty three but you

589
00:20:56,885 --> 00:20:58,775
basically said in your exe write what

590
00:20:58,775 --> 00:21:00,905
you wish you could but but ah

591
00:21:00,965 --> 00:21:02,285
i think if you if you had

592
00:21:02,285 --> 00:21:03,845
to pick a decade the seventy s

593
00:21:04,115 --> 00:21:06,065
have such a good breadth of styles

594
00:21:06,065 --> 00:21:09,815
of music you have like americana you

595
00:21:09,815 --> 00:21:12,095
a full rock you have ah funk

596
00:21:12,125 --> 00:21:14,015
you have disco you have the beginning

597
00:21:14,015 --> 00:21:14,675
of punk

598
00:21:15,125 --> 00:21:16,895
ah before you know you have new

599
00:21:16,895 --> 00:21:18,965
wave before it gets really bad so

600
00:21:18,995 --> 00:21:21,095
i think you have like all of

601
00:21:21,095 --> 00:21:23,525
stevie wonder practically yeah you know so

602
00:21:23,525 --> 00:21:25,385
much great stuff in in the seventies

603
00:21:25,745 --> 00:21:28,235
even though some of my favorite songs

604
00:21:28,235 --> 00:21:31,775
ever from the eighties um i would

605
00:21:31,775 --> 00:21:33,425
pick the i picked the seventies i

606
00:21:33,425 --> 00:21:34,745
like that answer i would pick the

607
00:21:34,745 --> 00:21:35,105
seventy s

608
00:21:35,135 --> 00:21:36,455
i was thinking for the same reason

609
00:21:36,575 --> 00:21:38,105
because there's such a there's such a

610
00:21:38,105 --> 00:21:39,995
wide variety of styles you also have

611
00:21:39,995 --> 00:21:43,055
people for older artists that are still

612
00:21:43,055 --> 00:21:44,885
alive at that time and still recording

613
00:21:44,885 --> 00:21:47,225
sinatra and dean martin and those people

614
00:21:47,225 --> 00:21:49,445
they're not making great records then but

615
00:21:49,445 --> 00:21:51,215
they save his junior i think was

616
00:21:51,215 --> 00:21:52,625
still sammy davis jr is doing okay

617
00:21:52,625 --> 00:21:53,855
like some of them were making like

618
00:21:53,945 --> 00:21:55,265
elevator music style

619
00:21:55,295 --> 00:21:57,485

624
00:22:07,775 --> 00:22:10,265
my answer is the sixties oh that's

625
00:22:10,265 --> 00:22:11,885
because most of my favorite music is

626
00:22:11,885 --> 00:22:13,895

00:22:13,925 --> 00:22:15,845

00:30:00,785 --> 00:30:02,675
normal shoes and you have to keep

867
00:30:02,675 --> 00:30:05,315
wearing them on and then of course

884
00:30:36,605 --> 00:30:37,505
speaking of narrow feet

885
00:30:38,155 --> 00:30:39,415
i couldn't wear the shoes that i

886
00:30:39,415 --> 00:30:41,725
really wanted to wear which were moccasins

887
00:30:41,725 --> 00:30:44,095

888
00:30:44,095 --> 00:30:46,174

00:30:49,105 --> 00:30:50,005
wear them and that's why i wear

892
00:30:50,005 --> 00:30:51,685
them all the time now wait so

893
00:30:51,685 --> 00:30:53,395
you had your your feet did you

894
00:30:53,395 --> 00:30:54,655
have to wear like sort of special

895
00:30:54,685 --> 00:30:56,245
issues oh no i just couldn't wear

896
00:30:56,245 --> 00:30:58,225
like slip on shoes because okay

897
00:30:58,465 --> 00:30:59,905
they would just look off oh

898
00:31:00,985 --> 00:31:03,355
they were called chas shaw oh they

899
00:31:03,355 --> 00:31:04,885
were called shaw's so i can't find

900
00:31:04,885 --> 00:31:06,205
a picture of the shoe here's a

901
00:31:06,205 --> 00:31:07,075
poster for them

902
00:31:08,455 --> 00:31:09,535
let me see the pose that's funny

903
00:31:09,535 --> 00:31:11,635
though because that's how you heard jaws

904
00:31:11,635 --> 00:31:12,955
and then you'd like you probably never

905
00:31:12,955 --> 00:31:14,365
saw it no they you know what

906
00:31:14,365 --> 00:31:15,985
i probably did know they were chas

907
00:31:16,045 --> 00:31:18,565
but in my mind i probably did

908
00:31:18,565 --> 00:31:21,115
know in your heart they were jaws

909
00:31:21,655 --> 00:31:23,365
you know what actually now that i'm

910
00:31:23,365 --> 00:31:24,685
thinking about it i didn't know it

911
00:31:25,135 --> 00:31:26,275
i just wanted to say it wrong

912
00:31:26,395 --> 00:31:28,285
like yeah one who i can't see

913
00:31:28,315 --> 00:31:29,665
a picture of these when i went

914
00:31:29,665 --> 00:31:33,385
on no i don't know but the

915
00:31:33,415 --> 00:31:35,605
poster says that they were real when

916
00:31:35,605 --> 00:31:37,765
you were in high school or just

917
00:31:37,765 --> 00:31:39,895
growing up was your sincere from here

918
00:31:40,225 --> 00:31:42,895
where your lockers outside ours were outside

919
00:31:42,895 --> 00:31:44,155
yeah always thought that was when i

920
00:31:44,155 --> 00:31:45,775
moved here it was like this is

921
00:31:45,775 --> 00:31:47,365
like tv like i'd never heard of

922
00:31:47,365 --> 00:31:48,355
that in my life

923
00:31:48,655 --> 00:31:50,065
oh right because every time i see

924
00:31:50,065 --> 00:31:52,945
lockers in tv they're inside now but

925
00:31:52,945 --> 00:31:54,325
i guess that's because of a sound

926
00:31:54,325 --> 00:31:56,785
studio oh yeah is maybe in the

927
00:31:56,785 --> 00:31:58,705
movies they were always outside yeah and

928
00:31:58,705 --> 00:32:02,215
like ninety s um like single cam

929
00:32:02,245 --> 00:32:05,185
thing yeah um but yeah that was

930
00:32:05,185 --> 00:32:07,315
like so crazy to me i couldn't

931
00:32:07,315 --> 00:32:08,515

00:32:08,605 --> 00:32:10,645
even on television until i moved here

933
00:32:10,645 --> 00:32:12,655
and and on a set and we

934
00:32:12,655 --> 00:32:13,855
were i think it was mister show

935
00:32:13,855 --> 00:32:15,055
and we were filming at a high

936
00:32:15,055 --> 00:32:17,245
school in simi valley and that's the

937
00:32:17,245 --> 00:32:18,955
first time i saw lockers outside and

938
00:32:18,955 --> 00:32:21,535
i was like whoa yeah it's always

939
00:32:21,535 --> 00:32:23,695
warm oak yeah yeah yeah we um

940
00:32:23,845 --> 00:32:26,305
i would have this thing where i

941
00:32:26,695 --> 00:32:28,705
with my desk growing up

942
00:32:28,765 --> 00:32:31,015
and ah and lockers i would just

943
00:32:31,015 --> 00:32:33,385
basically like throw shit in there like

944
00:32:33,385 --> 00:32:35,995
whatever papers or whatever to the point

945
00:32:35,995 --> 00:32:38,185
where i never would even use them

946
00:32:38,185 --> 00:32:40,495
anymore because they would just be piled

947
00:32:40,495 --> 00:32:43,405
high with papers and that i would

948
00:32:43,405 --> 00:32:45,085
never look at for until the end

949
00:32:45,085 --> 00:32:47,361

i had in my locker i guess

954
00:32:54,715 --> 00:32:56,665
like i like the books that i

955
00:32:56,665 --> 00:32:58,315
did the books that you weren't didn't

956
00:32:58,315 --> 00:33:00,145

00:33:02,275 --> 00:33:04,825
from your class yeah in some random

959
00:33:04,825 --> 00:33:06,175
place and so you would have to

960
00:33:06,175 --> 00:33:07,825
plan out your day to like ok

961
00:33:07,825 --> 00:33:09,085

962
00:33:09,085 --> 00:33:10,795
i'm back to my locker yeah so

963
00:33:10,795 --> 00:33:12,775
i would just take every book that

964
00:33:12,775 --> 00:33:14,635
i needed that day and carry them

965
00:33:14,635 --> 00:33:16,015
to every single class and never go

966
00:33:16,015 --> 00:33:17,763
to my well we did that and

967
00:33:17,763 --> 00:33:20,035
i it was like really cool to

968
00:33:20,035 --> 00:33:22,135
wear your backpack really low and full

969
00:33:22,765 --> 00:33:24,775
like below your booty hole like well

970
00:33:24,775 --> 00:33:26,245
your buddy who'll um like you'd wear

971
00:33:26,245 --> 00:33:28,075
like on the lowest strap like the

972
00:33:28,075 --> 00:33:29,245
lucis way the shop

973
00:33:29,245 --> 00:33:30,355
this could go and it would be

974
00:33:30,355 --> 00:33:31,525
like dangling down your back and like

975
00:33:31,525 --> 00:33:33,565
hitting your butt basically and that was

976
00:33:33,565 --> 00:33:35,875
really cool and we would carry all

977
00:33:35,875 --> 00:33:37,345
our books around but it was so

978
00:33:37,345 --> 00:33:40,075
heavy and this it feels like you

979
00:33:40,075 --> 00:33:42,025
would yeah balance would be like oh

980
00:33:42,055 --> 00:33:43,585
yeah and then they made a rule

981
00:33:43,585 --> 00:33:44,725
that we weren't allowed to do that

982
00:33:44,725 --> 00:33:46,135
we had to go to our lockers

983
00:33:46,645 --> 00:33:48,505
and we only wanted to make this

984
00:33:48,505 --> 00:33:49,345
rule like because every

00:33:49,405 --> 00:33:51,595
rns backs were getting hurt corner lodge

986
00:33:51,595 --> 00:33:52,525

987
00:33:52,525 --> 00:33:53,845
books like you and you couldn't use

988
00:33:53,845 --> 00:33:55,435

00:45:18,330 --> 00:45:20,190
to watch for that amount of time

1287
00:45:20,610 --> 00:45:23,400
so um what i'm proposing is obviously

1288
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:26,100
we don't have the ability to ah

1289
00:45:26,130 --> 00:45:28,290
make the episodes six hundred years right

1290
00:45:28,290 --> 00:45:31,650
now um and we can't do it

1291
00:45:31,650 --> 00:45:34,050
as it's airing ah so i think

1292
00:45:34,357 --> 00:45:35,640
what i'm proposing is we

1293
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:37,260
we need teams of c we need

1294
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:41,310
six hundred teams making each hour at

1295
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:43,740
simultaneously and when they put it together

1296
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:45,180
we'll put it together and it'll last

1297
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:47,190
for six hundred years smart i love

1298
00:45:47,430 --> 00:45:50,070

clock know i i'll try to get

1379
00:48:55,830 --> 00:48:58,020
through this quickly um so my idea

1380
00:48:58,050 --> 00:49:01,710
is a show and it's called potato

1381
00:49:01,740 --> 00:49:03,750
good start oh potatoes why

1382
00:49:04,290 --> 00:49:07,380
it's called potatoes camo whole potatoes camas

1383
00:49:07,470 --> 00:49:10,290
coma whole potatoes couple pertains that's interesting

1384
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:11,340
is it sort of like a chips

1385
00:49:11,340 --> 00:49:13,380
situation is but it's so this is

1386
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:16,050
an acronym it's the pair yeah what's

1387
00:49:16,114 --> 00:49:19,920
stand for it stands for people over

1388
00:49:20,430 --> 00:49:20,970
the

1389
00:49:22,230 --> 00:49:24,330
age that

1390
00:49:27,330 --> 00:49:28,200
originally

1391
00:49:31,740 --> 00:49:35,490
um run exists people over the age

1392
00:49:35,490 --> 00:49:39,540
that originally exists sometimes sometimes kombucha ma

1393
00:49:41,190 --> 00:49:41,820
women

1394
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:47,550
however women however only so another colony

1395
00:49:47,820 --> 00:49:52,380
live eternally and then the first part

1396
00:49:52,410 --> 00:49:54,120
then the first part again interesting so

1397
00:49:54,660 --> 00:50:00,000
so people over the age originally originally

1398
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,820
exist winning

1399
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:06,810
women women however however only live turn

1400
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:08,550
only live really interesting so this is

1401
00:50:08,550 --> 00:50:12,240
about existence itself yeah so it's really

1402
00:50:12,270 --> 00:50:14,340
um just like a nerd situation no

1403
00:50:14,340 --> 00:50:15,930
one ever really dies like a barrel

1404
00:50:15,930 --> 00:50:18,270
type thing um yeah if that's something

1405
00:50:18,270 --> 00:50:20,220
you're interested in it can definitely be

1406
00:50:20,250 --> 00:50:22,410
our nerds in it yes like big

1407
00:50:22,410 --> 00:50:23,130
bang theory there's

1408
00:50:23,190 --> 00:50:25,050
one yeah there's one nerd but adults

1409
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:26,910
um so it takes to basically what

1410
00:50:26,910 --> 00:50:30,330
it is is it's um a bunch

1411
00:50:30,330 --> 00:50:34,410
of cops and they're the original cops

1412
00:50:34,860 --> 00:50:36,750
so it's ah is cops an acronym

1413
00:50:36,750 --> 00:50:40,710
as well yes it is ah can't

1414
00:50:40,770 --> 00:50:43,290
only perpetrate

1415
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:46,740
strangers go oh that's guys true a

1416
00:50:46,740 --> 00:50:48,240
good tip for copy it is yeah

1417
00:50:48,257 --> 00:50:50,220
yeah yeah sometimes you have to arrest

1418
00:50:50,220 --> 00:50:51,810
someone you know you can't that's gonna

1419
00:50:51,810 --> 00:50:54,060
be an uncomfortable situation and that's part

1420
00:50:54,060 --> 00:50:55,080
of what we're getting into so it's

1421
00:50:55,110 --> 00:50:58,290
really for dramas old old original cops

1422
00:50:58,290 --> 00:51:00,210
the original comics for people who were

1423
00:51:00,210 --> 00:51:02,370
ever police and they're still doing okay

1424
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:03,480
adding they

1425
00:51:04,125 --> 00:51:06,585
and are they there or what time

1426
00:51:06,585 --> 00:51:08,445
is it said in its time of

1427
00:51:08,445 --> 00:51:11,655
day it's set at noon every episode

1428
00:51:11,685 --> 00:51:13,755
i loot i love that yeah i

1429
00:51:13,755 --> 00:51:15,555
love that you were home watching tv

1430
00:51:16,155 --> 00:51:17,835
when they're always on their luxury bed

1431
00:51:19,425 --> 00:51:20,595
and the capture was on lunch so

1432
00:51:20,595 --> 00:51:23,115
they're off duty but something will happen

1433
00:51:23,115 --> 00:51:24,465
and they'll realize they'll have to step

1434
00:51:24,465 --> 00:51:27,135
in so um so they're primarily off

1435
00:51:27,135 --> 00:51:29,205
duty unless they witnessed a crime and

1436
00:51:29,205 --> 00:51:30,555
then they have to go no one

1437
00:51:30,555 --> 00:51:31,215
alright job

1438
00:51:32,505 --> 00:51:34,545

1440
00:51:37,335 --> 00:51:39,195

00:51:39,195 --> 00:51:42,825
this ah tahini for twenty four tb

1442
00:51:42,825 --> 00:51:43,455
in it yes

1443
00:51:45,135 --> 00:51:46,845
um you know and so it's about

1444
00:51:46,845 --> 00:51:48,255
a group and there's ten of them

1445
00:51:48,315 --> 00:51:49,815
and they all link arms and walk

1446
00:51:49,815 --> 00:51:51,465
around town together and they go and

1447
00:51:51,465 --> 00:51:53,175
have lunch wow of course they have

1448
00:51:53,175 --> 00:51:55,635
doughnut they link arms walking around down

1449
00:51:55,665 --> 00:51:57,285
unless they witness a crime or do

1450
00:51:57,285 --> 00:51:59,385
they then arrest the perpetrators so then

1451
00:51:59,385 --> 00:52:01,185
they start and create a circle around

1452
00:52:01,185 --> 00:52:03,585
the bad guy oh until they intimidate

1453
00:52:03,585 --> 00:52:04,845
him into putting on his own hand

1454
00:52:04,875 --> 00:52:07,228
cuff so walking around town straight-line yeah

1455
00:52:07,245 --> 00:52:09,495
think dorms then they complete the circle

1456
00:52:09,555 --> 00:52:12,135
yes okay god now do people refer

1457
00:52:12,135 --> 00:52:14,205

whole potatoes

1459
00:52:16,065 --> 00:52:19,095
we never hear that word ever which

1460
00:52:19,095 --> 00:52:21,375
one potatoes p they will say hold

1461
00:52:21,375 --> 00:52:22,395
because it just is a word to

1462
00:52:22,395 --> 00:52:24,345
use more often right like like hey

1463
00:52:24,345 --> 00:52:26,625
fill my holes yeah or sticking it

1464
00:52:26,625 --> 00:52:26,955
in the hole

1465
00:52:28,605 --> 00:52:30,255

1515
00:54:26,865 --> 00:54:28,755
said or just the whole pitch well

1516
00:54:28,755 --> 00:54:30,885
i when we said that sexy thing

1517
00:54:30,885 --> 00:54:32,505
about getting your holes filled we kind

1518
00:54:32,505 --> 00:54:34,005
of expected this to devolve into i

1519
00:54:34,005 --> 00:54:35,145
mean it's the last pitch of the

1520
00:54:35,145 --> 00:54:36,375
day and we kind of thought that

1521
00:54:36,375 --> 00:54:38,265
something would happen i'm also worried we're

1522
00:54:38,265 --> 00:54:39,795
never gonna get the right demographic

1524
00:54:41,565 --> 00:54:43,275
yeah okay and it's so inherent to

1525
00:54:43,275 --> 00:54:44,895
the pitch yeah no i don't think

1526
00:54:44,895 --> 00:54:45,821
