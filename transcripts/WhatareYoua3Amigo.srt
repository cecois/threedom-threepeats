it's all like this and i grew

134
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:06,990
up rebelling against that you know so

135
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:09,839

00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:12,450
sort of mid atlantic accents in order

137
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:15,060
to seem smarter than i was and

00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:17,160
that's the new and that's how you

139
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:20,490

extent i could find out what anyone's

friends end up dying stuff and and

219
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:57,120
but so that would be sort of

220
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,020
it but i don't know i would

221
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:59,491

there's there's a few there's a t

246
00:08:43,688 --> 00:08:45,660
tiny handful of people that i'm still

247
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:48,450
in contact with at all from high

248
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:50,970
school not even regular contact but then

249
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:54,120
people that we have each other's info

250
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:56,250
you know i'm i've been terrible about

251
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,990
keeping up with that and it's not

252
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,420
it's nothing personal it really is just

253
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:03,000
that for me especially it's so long

254
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:03,750
ago now

255
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,610
and we have not been in each

256
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:07,230
other's lives like you haven't used to

257
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:08,790
do the ten or twenty right i've

258
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:10,110
never been to y so i feel

259
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:11,160
like because i went to ten and

260
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,200
twenty it's like oh now ten years

261
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,190
later i want to see what all

262
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:15,450
those people are up to again yeah

263
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,890
like i feel like there's continuity there

264
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,810
for me i guess i don't like

265
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,880
i it's i feel the same way

266
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:23,400
as and that if i wanted to

267
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,000
see

268
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,892
certain people i would see them but

269
00:09:25,892 --> 00:09:27,660
the the people that i kind of

270
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:29,190
knew in high school are the people

271
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:31,080
that i just saw because we had

272
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:34,260
classes together but weren't necessarily my friends

273
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,870
i just feel like i don't know

274
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:39,600
what that evening would be do you

275
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,430
know what i think what i'm interested

276
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:43,890
in is knowing i like to know

277
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:44,130
how like

278
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,990
a story ends or like how it

279
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:47,340
goes where it's like i have an

280
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:49,770
idea of ah this person from high

281
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:51,270
school and then i'm like oh i

282
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:53,280
would love to know what happened next

283
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,510
for them like right if they were

284
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:56,490
really popular they were whatever they were

285
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:57,960
and then like oh and now they

286
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,490
do this job and that's that actually

287
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:00,930
makes sense because back then they were

288
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:02,010
kind of into this thing i don't

289
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:03,960
know i'm just curious how like life

290
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:04,320
goes

291
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,680
yeah guess i'll be honest it was

292
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:08,984
really neat that's faith that terrible we

293
00:10:08,984 --> 00:10:10,640
should also i'm at a different point

294
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,800
where i'm like everyone's figuring it out

295
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:14,570
at this point in my life like

296
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:17,000
it's yes it seems like people are

297
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,290
starting to find the job they really

298
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,880
care about and then that's interesting to

299
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,394
me but like you know you probably

300
00:10:21,425 --> 00:10:22,790
like who cares i mean the people

301
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:23,840
that i went to school with and

302
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,100
it was a catholic school and i

303
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:29,900
feel like you know it people i

304
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,400
would imagine that most of the people

305
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,350
that i knew and hung out with

306
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:35,600
um that were in my in the

307
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:38,780
like expanded circle um you know people

308
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:40,850
are married and they have kids and

309
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:42,800
they work at gas stations they all

310
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,690

311
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:48,440

00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,990
my ten because i was like i

313
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:52,760

370
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:32,900
out to fill manage out there in

371
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:35,121
new york i feel friends with most

372
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:36,230
of the people that i really liked

373
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:36,440
that

374
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:38,330
time right so it's like that's also

375
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:39,140
part of it for me is that

376
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:41,600
i'm like my fear and this this

377
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:43,880
this is this is because i think

378
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,740
when you move away from home

379
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:49,850
you are you're not as reminded of

380
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,560
the stuff from that time in your

381
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:54,080
life because you've you've moved into your

382
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:56,360
not you're not seeing as you're literally

383
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:57,740
not seeing as many things that will

384
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:59,900
remind you right of those days right

385
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:02,442
so i had dinner with ah a

386
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:06,080
really close friend of mine um and

387
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,750
he you know we we hadn't seen

388
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:09,710
each other in years and i was

389
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:11,540
back in philly for a gig and

390
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,454
um he was reminding me stories and

391
00:13:13,454 --> 00:13:15,590
i know i you'd block block them

392
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:17,420
out exactly really true for the people

393
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:19,250
who who would have not moved away

394
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:21,800
or go back there yeah they remember

395
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,110
more from that time yes they're constantly

396
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:25,790
somebody but no i was an hour

397
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:27,080
away i'd forgotten

398
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:29,180
everything about it to the extent where

399
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:31,160
i was at my friend's house my

400
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,750
friend had like a really big kind

401
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,220
of mansion out there in orange county

402
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:35,840
and he had a huge backyard party

403
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,370
in some of our teachers were there

404
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:38,780
including this one teacher that i had

405
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:42,560
feuded with um and she and i

406
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,790
was nominated for an emmy at that

407
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:46,220
point and she and she came up

408
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:47,030
to me the reason i

409
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,310
mentioned is because she came on time

410
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:51,142
yes no she came up to me

411
00:13:51,142 --> 00:13:53,960
it was like so hey how are

412
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,790
you so i understand you're nominated for

413
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:57,710
an emmy so i guess what i

414
00:13:57,710 --> 00:13:59,870
told you that day when i have

415
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:02,360
that discussion with you after class really

416
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,400
must have ah i really must have

417
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:05,990
stuck with you and i was like

418
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:07,400
i don't remember any

419
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:08,810
thing that you're talking about i don't

420
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:10,550
really remember much from high school i

421
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:14,600
walked you ask ah good fans crazy

422
00:14:14,627 --> 00:14:17,180
good for you good for yeah i'm

423
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:18,620
afraid like if i if i went

424
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:20,660
to a uni especially now because it's

425
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:22,970
it's i graduated in nineteen eighty six

426
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,160
and it's so long ago yeah that

427
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:27,080
i feel like my fear is that

428
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:27,560
it would be like

429
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:29,840
that dinner that i had where i

430
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,880
just wouldn't you know they run a

431
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,289
member to say oh the memories that

432
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:35,720
i have are so there's there there's

433
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:38,450
so like fleeting words like just scraps

434
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:40,310
of things and if somebody's gonna remind

435
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:41,750
me of something that happened and i'm

436
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:42,830
not going to remember i'm gonna feel

437
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:44,420
terrible and i think you know what

438
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:46,070
i would rather do i don't have

439
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:47,660
an interest in reminiscing

440
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:49,158
so when i think about going to

441
00:14:49,158 --> 00:14:50,390
one of these things it's not to

442
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:52,250
talk about what we did the old

443
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:54,860
days just just talking about whatever yeah

444
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:56,270
that's one more interested in that like

445
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:58,610
just seeing how people have evolved sure

446
00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:00,110
but i feel like don't you i

447
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:01,670
would imagine though the reminiscing is a

448
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:03,950
huge part of these things yes but

449
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:04,970
i don't only think of that when

450
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:06,080
i think think for some people it

451
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,640
is yeah but but there's a lot

452
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:07,880

532
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:55,850
it anyway i think

533
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,820
okay i can't deal with this no

534
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:00,620
but i being a drama you know

535
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:02,090
people from all grades or whatever so

536
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:03,140
i would have known people but i

537
00:18:03,142 --> 00:18:04,850
just i was i don't know if

538
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:06,230
he was busy too it felt weird

539
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:08,210
did you go to college scott i

540
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:10,010
can't remember i went to two years

541
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:13,400
of ah community college as meaning i

542
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:15,620
i did two years at cypress college

543
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:17,240
but then i also went to

544
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:19,070
two other community colleges because they would

545
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:20,600
have plays that i would audition to

546
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,860
be in a new admin role at

547
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:22,910
the colleges so i think i would

548
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:25,010
like for schools for those two years

549
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:26,750
and then i went to my acting

550
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:28,940
school for another two years and we

551
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:31,100
would have reunions there okay did you

552
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:33,500

631
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:16,190
in having taken a p courses in

632
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:17,240
high school so i didn't have to

633
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,740
take any math and i didn't have

634
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:21,380
to take any english so and i

635
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:22,520
went in going like i want to

636
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,420
get in and out of here

637
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:24,620
here so i'm going to take way

638
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:28,700
more ah credits than than i'm allowed

639
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:30,680
i think you were allowed eighteen or

640
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:31,760
something like that and i would take

641
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,990
twenty three or something and i would

642
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:34,250
have to go and get permission they

643
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:35,750
were like well you're obviously smart because

644
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:37,220
you've taken all these api courses in

645
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:39,230
high school so yes you are allowed

646
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:40,700
and then i would fail like every

647
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:43,340
class because my my

648
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:45,890
my schedule was i had classes from

649
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:49,190
eight to noon than i had drama

650
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:53,030
at two and then i had ah

651
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:55,130
rehearsals at seven for whatever show i

652
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:57,110
was in seven to eleven right so

653
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:58,430
what i would do is i would

654
00:21:58,430 --> 00:22:01,070
go to rehearsal at seven pm and

655
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:03,530
at eleven than stay with my friends

656
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:03,710
in the

657
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:06,590
parking lot drinking beer till five and

658
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:08,900
then go home and sleep for one

659
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:12,230
hour wake up go to class for

660
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:15,590
four hours ah then go home take

661
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:17,780
a nap in between drama then take

662
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:20,240
drama then take another nap before before

663
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:23,330
so i was fucked up the entire

664
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:23,900
time and i would

665
00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:25,640
often just miss class i would just

666
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,740
sure i was class was the thing

667
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:29,000
that i would just totally blow off

668
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,240
so i failed art history twice um

669
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:35,120
i i i failed every single semester

670
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,100
just like bringing home efs efs efs

671
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:38,060
the only thing that i did well

672
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:39,980
on was economics because i think it's

673
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:41,450
related to math which i was good

674
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:43,944
at yeah so um so and my

675
00:22:43,944 --> 00:22:44,060
pay

676
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:45,740
parents were just like we can't keep

677
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:48,080
this going for you we're not going

678
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,430
to keep paying even though his community

679
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:51,350
college and relatively cheap two hundred and

680
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:52,610
fifty bucks or whatever they're like you

681
00:22:52,610 --> 00:22:54,260
can't stay at home if you're going

682
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:56,840
to be failing yeah you're we're going

683
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,160
to kick you out you know so

684
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,420
but i never cared i just never

685
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:02,600
i never wanted a degree my parents

686
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,800
were always like well what if you

you can always be a teacher because

697
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,460
i'm like i don't want to do

698
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:24,290
that yeah like well also i'm

699
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:26,750
in my view that i like yes

700
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:29,600
i checked sign i never bothered me

701
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:34,100
because i started doing stand-up before i

702
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:36,650
went to college so that's why i

703
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:38,420
didn't stay around college song because i

704
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:40,220
was like already had a taste of

705
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:41,330
the thing that i wanted to do

706
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:44,480
and i was immediately recognized

707
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:46,700
by the community as somebody who had

708
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,410

use i don't understand the worries that

739
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:00,380
i would add about ah but i

740
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:01,850
like i cared about that and i

741
00:25:01,852 --> 00:25:03,410
and because they did i also that

742
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:03,740
was par

743
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:05,240
out of it but i was like

744
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,800
i would really like to have a

745
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,900
degree before i pursue this i was

746
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:10,328
also pursuing him probably doing a lot

747
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:11,450
stuff while i was in college but

748
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:13,010
didn't pursue a career professionally until i

749
00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:16,040
graduated and i but i think about

750
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,300
it now and i'm like i don't

751
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:18,410
really know where i stand on it

752
00:25:18,410 --> 00:25:20,390
because i have so many friends who

753
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:22,310
didn't go to college and it's fine

754
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:23,660
and i also understood at the time

755
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:23,825
that

756
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:25,280
it would be fine if i didn't

757
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:26,120
or whatever it wouldn't be the end

758
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:28,190
of the world but i like still

759
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:30,170
like really respected the idea of it

760
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:31,940
and i when i think about like

761
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:33,200
oh having kids i mean like what

762
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,520
i make them go to college i

763
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,710
sort of still think i would make

764
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:39,800
them but i don't know i'm not

765
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:42,890
sure a degree means that much in

766
00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:43,940
certain fields anymore

767
00:25:44,090 --> 00:25:45,170
depending on what and i know they're

768
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:46,790
really good i agree but i'm saying

769
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:48,200
like if they were interested in pursuing

770
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,450
like the arts and i i there's

771
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:51,440
a part of me that thinks that

772
00:25:51,530 --> 00:25:53,300
would be good he want that guy

773
00:25:53,328 --> 00:25:54,230
i will say that i have a

774
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:56,870
friend right now who is has been

775
00:25:56,870 --> 00:25:59,000
working in the arts for ten years

776
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:00,950
and wants to get out of it

777
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:03,740
and wants a certain job and she's

778
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:04,220
saying like

779
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:05,750
yeah but i was one semester shy

780
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:07,070
of getting my degree and i would

781
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:09,170
need this and so it it has

782
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:11,000
come up for her yeah and i

783
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:11,840
have seen it come up for other

784
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,910
people to learn semester and that has

785
00:26:13,910 --> 00:26:15,470
happened to a lot of websites i

786
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:17,870
actually need one more crushers close yeah

787
00:26:17,930 --> 00:26:20,000
yeah and then i just like but

788
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,680
no cigar right which is good cause

789
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,640
he couldn't you know you got a

790
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,050
cigar now you guys are these guys

791
00:26:24,072 --> 00:26:24,350
close

792
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:25,610
you do get a cigar is there

793
00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:26,840
a limit on when you are able

794
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,190
to complete no i think you can

795
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:30,050
do it like anyone no statute of

796
00:26:30,050 --> 00:26:32,990
limitations you can go i actually though

797
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:35,030
i will say there are so many

798
00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:37,730
subjects that i have no knowledge of

799
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:39,440
like chemistry for instance i don't know

800
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,640
how it works or what it is

801
00:26:41,090 --> 00:26:42,740
um and a lot of history and

802
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:44,540
stuff that i occasionally will pay

803
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:48,050
peruse a local colleges courses and say

804
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:48,800
i think it would be kind of

805
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:51,080
fun to take a course i think

806
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,880
what stops but yeah yeah writing a

807
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,620
paper like i just don't want to

808
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:57,320
write a fucking paper about already helped

809
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:00,020
writing my scripts yeah like word shorter

810
00:27:00,050 --> 00:27:02,030
yeah but i'm a bad student in

811
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:03,980
that if it's not something i'm

812
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:07,970

at economics ah yes but ah um

923
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:08,450
so he he came to visit me

924
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:09,800
at the restaurant once and have have

925
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,210
lunch and then he said you know

926
00:31:11,210 --> 00:31:12,320
what i used to worry

927
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:15,800
about you but i realize that even

928
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,840
if you don't make it in show

929
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:22,160
business i realised people like you you

930
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:24,080
do well at your jobs and i

931
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,370
just think you're going to be okay

932
00:31:26,570 --> 00:31:28,790
and wow yeah i couldn't believe it

933
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:31,790
oh yeah absolutely my parents believe in

934
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:33,770
me and so they were like you're

935
00:31:33,770 --> 00:31:35,540
gonna make it no matter what no

936
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:36,800
they didn't i don't think they always

937
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:39,620
thought that but as i've developed you

938
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:40,460
know a career and up to the

939
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:41,870
point where i know i will be

940
00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:45,470
okay they are like the supportive of

941
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:46,580
me and like not trying to tell

942
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:46,640
me

943
00:31:46,670 --> 00:31:47,930
not my mum everyone's home will say

944
00:31:47,930 --> 00:31:49,010
something like you know if you always

945
00:31:49,010 --> 00:31:50,150
wanna do something else you always can't

946
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:51,380
write because i think she sees the

947
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:53,210
stress of it as young like i

948
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:55,730
i've learned not to tell her most

949
00:31:55,730 --> 00:31:57,590
of the yeah you're stressing out yeah

950
00:31:57,650 --> 00:31:59,330
well no but like like where it's

951
00:31:59,330 --> 00:32:00,980
like i don't talk about every audition

952
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:02,150
because then it's like oh did you

953
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:03,260
hear about that audition it's like well

954
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:04,400
no i never hear about any audition

955
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,510
it's just like right yeah they don't

956
00:32:05,510 --> 00:32:06,701
know that like that's a very

957
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,360
pacific thing yes is that you have

958
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:10,160
to stop telling people about additions yeah

959
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:12,740
because yeah they don't understand they can't

960
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:15,530
i mean on the one hand yes

961
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:17,120
it is let's cool i really like

962
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,920
this page a series of job interview

963
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,600
right you know and if you don't

964
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,940
get the job than the normal in

965
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:25,370
the normal thing circumstances what you want

966
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:26,960
char yeah yeah yeah

967
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,190
oh so you don't ever hear if

968
00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:29,270
you don't get audition and then i

969
00:32:29,270 --> 00:32:30,470
have like other things where it's like

970
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:31,760
you're waiting to hear about something and

971
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,860
i'm like i'm personally stressed waiting to

972
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:34,910
hear about this thing yeah but if

973
00:32:34,910 --> 00:32:36,454
i tell her that then she's gonna

974
00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:37,940
do and then like did you hear

975
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:38,780
yet did you hear yet and it's

976
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:41,210
like every fucking know java got to

977
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:42,740
know that i feel as crazy as

978
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:44,240
you do but i it's better just

979
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,320
to give you some good news when

980
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:47,030
it happens but i think the

981
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:49,040
part that makes me want to tell

982
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,030
her is the part that i'm like

983
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:51,770
see i always have some hope going

984
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:53,330
like yeah even if i'm doing i

985
00:32:53,330 --> 00:32:54,590
do all my little things that keep

986
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:56,330
me going and i always have something

987
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:58,910
flowing but like garraway but there's like

988
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:01,040
a show there's always a big hope

989
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:02,780
that's kind of there and oh it

990
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:04,940
all the whole the big hope is

991
00:33:05,090 --> 00:33:06,680
theirs but i'm just saying that lord

992
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:07,280
lab guess

993
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:10,790
show what i'm saying like there's california

994
00:33:11,352 --> 00:33:14,930
point which is just that like there's

995
00:33:14,930 --> 00:33:16,820
potential like oh i'm waiting to hear

996
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:18,140
about this thing and it's like that'll

997
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:19,730
keep me going in my day-to-day life

998
00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:22,130
but like for me that's good but

999
00:33:22,130 --> 00:33:24,170
for her that's more stressful it's like

1000
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:25,280
it's like for me it's like there's

1001
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:27,440
always some positivity circling like

1002
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:28,850
there could be something that maybe they'll

1003
00:33:28,850 --> 00:33:29,840
go away and then something else will

1004
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,520
be the thing but it's not the

1005
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:35,690
life for people who like structure right

1006
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:38,030
things like that are you know like

1007
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:39,740
what's going to happen oh what kind

1008
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:42,800
of money like landing yeah all that

1009
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,360
kind of stuff is it's very difficult

1010
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:46,490
for people to understand yeah i think

1011
00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:47,030
a funeral

1012
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:50,780
my ah the opposite of which though

1013
00:33:50,810 --> 00:33:52,580
is i would tell my parents about

1014
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:55,250
things to make them feel better about

1015
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:57,140
my life where i would be like

1016
00:33:57,170 --> 00:33:59,630
oh yeah so ah you know this

1017
00:33:59,630 --> 00:34:01,370
script i got i made the deal

1018
00:34:01,370 --> 00:34:03,710
to write this script and ah they

1019
00:34:03,710 --> 00:34:05,570
didn't ended up not making it but

1020
00:34:05,570 --> 00:34:07,010
you know like i paid this much

1021
00:34:07,010 --> 00:34:07,760
to do everything

1022
00:34:07,910 --> 00:34:09,740
cool and and my my mom would

1023
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:10,460
just go like

1024
00:34:11,690 --> 00:34:13,970
i don't get how your career works

1025
00:34:13,970 --> 00:34:16,040
but i guess it's fine i'm trying

1026
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,930
to explain it to you old missions

1027
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:19,760
because she wanted something to point to

1028
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,140
i feel like with her friends to

1029
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:23,090
be like look my and my son's

1030
00:34:23,330 --> 00:34:25,520
show is out or move right here's

1031
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,710
where i totally understand that is because

1032
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:30,110
when i would have to you know

1033
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:31,760
get a new apartment or something new

1034
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:32,510
rhubarb

1035
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:37,160
to have to explain on a form

1036
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:39,260
like how you make a living yeah

1037
00:34:39,429 --> 00:34:41,300
it's fill me with so much stress

1038
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:42,710
like no one's going to believe this

1039
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:43,940
like when you see it on paper

1040
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:45,800
it looks like crazy ridiculous you just

1041
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,180
show bank statements because i like that's

1042
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:48,231

1070
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:54,620
you know they've been gone for a

1071
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:58,070
long time and our respective relationships like

1072
00:35:58,070 --> 00:35:59,180
i was close to my mom that

1073
00:35:59,181 --> 00:36:01,430
my dad my dad was so she's

1074
00:36:01,430 --> 00:36:04,100
not oh right you know i mean

1075
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:06,080
she was not easy she was not

1076
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,040
easy but she was

1077
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,840
cause i know that she loved me

1078
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:09,770
you know what i mean like we

1079
00:36:09,770 --> 00:36:10,760
had we had a lot of great

1080
00:36:10,790 --> 00:36:11,600
tools too

1081
00:36:13,370 --> 00:36:14,300
i was gonna say yeah but i

1082
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:16,010
held back because i want to have

1083
00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:18,560
a chance that she would say she

1084
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,060
could say that easily she could say

1085
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:22,070
that she loved me but um but

1086
00:36:22,070 --> 00:36:23,420
yeah we had we there were there

1087
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:24,380
were good times with my mom but

1088
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:25,820
she was not she was not easy

1089
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:27,350
but my dad was like so quiet

1090
00:36:27,350 --> 00:36:30,920
and remote that it's like he it's

1091
00:36:31,010 --> 00:36:32,750
like he's it's the same now as

1092
00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:32,960
when he

1093
00:36:32,963 --> 00:36:35,302
was alive wow it's really i mean

1094
00:36:35,302 --> 00:36:36,590
it really is like that you know

1095
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:39,440
um i would call him i would

1096
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,790
call him twice a year i would

1097
00:36:40,790 --> 00:36:42,080
call them on father's day and i'd

1098
00:36:42,081 --> 00:36:43,490
call him on his birthday and it

1099
00:36:43,490 --> 00:36:45,920
was always like an awkward conversation right

1100
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:47,420
so it's almost like you don't have

1101
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:49,250
to do those anymore which is yeah

1102
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:52,520
nice kind of yeah you know yeah

1103
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:56,270
that's so interesting thinking about those relationships

1104
00:36:56,570 --> 00:36:58,220
i don't know just thinking about people

1105
00:36:58,220 --> 00:37:01,040
going into like like someone who just

1106
00:37:01,070 --> 00:37:02,150
like it's like thinking that somebody having

1107
00:37:02,150 --> 00:37:03,260
a baby and then being like i'll

1108
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:05,780
be a very detached father i just

1109
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:07,700
say yeah well it's not a father

1110
00:37:07,787 --> 00:37:09,620
piss i'm sure another he was rent

1111
00:37:09,650 --> 00:37:11,480
to what was expected of you has

1112
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:13,250
changed so dramatically

1113
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,780
over the year i also don't know

1114
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:16,790
what changed like because my mother and

1115
00:37:16,790 --> 00:37:18,590
father did not have a good relationship

1116
00:37:18,590 --> 00:37:20,390
they must have had it for a

1117
00:37:20,390 --> 00:37:22,640
while must have been okay but but

1118
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,710
growing up i i don't remember i

1119
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:27,380
never saw them exchange any affection and

1120
00:37:27,410 --> 00:37:31,250
they effectively stopped speaking to each other

1121
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:33,290
you know when i was very young

1122
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:33,440
you

1123
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,720
no and they would like when they

1124
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:38,180
had to to talk about you know

1125
00:37:38,510 --> 00:37:40,070
whatever about the house they would talk

1126
00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:41,300
to each other but they it's not

1127
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:42,740
like they would strike up a conversation

1128
00:37:42,770 --> 00:37:45,230
you know um i remember like i

1129
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:46,640
remember them doing stuff we would all

1130
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,590
do stuff as a family when i

1131
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:51,350
was little but i think like definitely

1132
00:37:51,350 --> 00:37:52,730
by the time i was in say

1133
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:53,600
like eighth grade

1134
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:56,090
aid there there they were done you

1135
00:37:56,090 --> 00:37:58,520
know right um separate bedrooms and really

1136
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,890
yeah yeah yeah yeah which which i

1137
00:38:00,890 --> 00:38:04,010
was some people do three-star yeah um

1138
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:06,470
some people do that for the safe

1139
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:08,930
for snoring yeah i'd like and i

1140
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:10,040
well first of all i knew a

1141
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,960
couple who did that a while ago

1142
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:13,760
and they had

1143
00:38:13,790 --> 00:38:15,740
two separate rooms but then and like

1144
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:17,630
they were decorated totally differently and right

1145
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:18,860
had their own style and then i

1146
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:19,730
was just reading about this on a

1147
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:23,300
blog talking about peoples like marriage advice

1148
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:24,650
or whatever and it was like always

1149
00:38:24,650 --> 00:38:26,480
have separate rooms and well all these

1150
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,790
people were talking one one person's quote

1151
00:38:28,790 --> 00:38:29,990
was all about how they sleep in

1152
00:38:29,990 --> 00:38:32,420
separate rooms for snoring and another person

1153
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:33,920
was autistic and then they

1154
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:37,040
they have very specific um things that

1155
00:38:37,490 --> 00:38:39,140
who is who is attic was at

1156
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:41,480
utah it was weird it was like

1157
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:44,660
boom boom boom chika

1158
00:38:45,770 --> 00:38:48,410
principal oh yeah

1159
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:52,580
ah but this person was assassinated with

1160
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:54,710
the principal from ferris bueller i got

1161
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:56,420
my reasons um

1162
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:00,170
my reasons anyway so they have a

1163
00:39:00,170 --> 00:39:01,640
lot of sensory issues and so that

1164
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:03,530
right so sleep next to somebody yeah

1165
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:04,970
but i think it's interesting i mean

1166
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:07,610
obviously your situation was different than those

1167
00:39:07,610 --> 00:39:09,470
but to think about people doing it

1168
00:39:09,470 --> 00:39:11,300
so that the relationship will work is

1169
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:14,060
interesting like but yeah it sounds like

1170
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:15,500
it was more like i i don't

1171
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:17,090
want to be like why would we

1172
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:17,570
do

1173
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:19,460
let it read this enlightening ticket divorced

1174
00:39:20,330 --> 00:39:22,400
um i think it was because of

1175
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,800
religion and because of it was just

1176
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:26,030
ah

1177
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:27,440
i think for my mom i was

1178
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,090
like well what would i do then

1179
00:39:29,090 --> 00:39:30,779
where would i go yeah you know

1180
00:39:30,890 --> 00:39:32,840
all these kids and everything yeah you

1181
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:35,360
know i just don't see i think

1182
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:37,820
it was probably like logistically how would

1183
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:39,590
this work it's just such a big

1184
00:39:39,590 --> 00:39:40,970
can of worms when you decide to

1185
00:39:40,970 --> 00:39:43,430
do that apparent yeah that um

1186
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:47,420
no it's just separate rooms knows getting

1187
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:50,120
a divorce just like it's the unknown

1188
00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:51,530
so much of it is the unknown

1189
00:39:51,530 --> 00:39:52,910
of like we gotta split up our

1190
00:39:52,910 --> 00:39:55,010
money we gotta get yeah two separate

1191
00:39:55,010 --> 00:39:57,080
places it's just so much that's i

1192
00:39:57,110 --> 00:39:58,130

00:48:59,490 --> 00:49:02,970
person a title of a tv show

1463
00:49:02,970 --> 00:49:04,440
or a movie let's do movies this

1464
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:05,910
time because we did tv shows plus

1465
00:49:05,910 --> 00:49:07,560
size so this is this is will

1466
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:09,120
give you a movie title and you

1467
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:10,470
have to so you have to do

1468
00:49:10,470 --> 00:49:11,760
the op is do a title that

1469
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:13,620
is the opposite of whatever title it

1470
00:49:13,620 --> 00:49:13,860
is

1471
00:49:13,890 --> 00:49:15,510
like every word is it's opposite and

1472
00:49:15,510 --> 00:49:16,740
then you have to pitch that movie

1473
00:49:16,740 --> 00:49:18,570
to us fear for example would be

1474
00:49:18,570 --> 00:49:21,990
cube exactly thank you perfectly said but

1475
00:49:21,990 --> 00:49:23,430
