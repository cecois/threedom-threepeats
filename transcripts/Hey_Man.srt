00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,310
windows ninety five it was i mean

559
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:26,480

565
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:35,060
because the the bar owners and the

566
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:36,470
people in the bar would be looking

00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:38,390

00:21:10,915 --> 00:21:14,515
to mentees and um you know the

610
00:21:14,515 --> 00:21:16,825
ice cream place yeah it's a fro-yo

611
00:21:16,825 --> 00:21:19,525
place and in i've lately been having

612
00:21:19,795 --> 00:21:22,525
a craving for some original tart okay

613
00:21:22,735 --> 00:21:24,745
oh and i've been going there kind

614
00:21:24,745 --> 00:21:26,635
of like regularly but i went to

615
00:21:26,635 --> 00:21:28,345
one that i haven't been to and

616
00:21:28,345 --> 00:21:28,705
they

617
00:21:28,885 --> 00:21:31,225
the covert protocols with these places just

618
00:21:31,255 --> 00:21:32,815
it just is such a bummer like

619
00:21:33,055 --> 00:21:34,195
i got i walked in there and

620
00:21:34,195 --> 00:21:35,965
the woman like everything looked like it

621
00:21:35,965 --> 00:21:37,045
was open for me to do it

622
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:39,865
myself but the woman was like i

623
00:21:39,865 --> 00:21:40,945
have to do it but she seemed

624
00:21:41,065 --> 00:21:42,325
really sad about it and then

625
00:21:43,645 --> 00:21:44,545
i told her what i want but

626
00:21:44,545 --> 00:21:45,595
that's like it would be a cool

627
00:21:45,595 --> 00:21:49,165
job to have a bookstore just stuff

628
00:21:49,225 --> 00:21:49,705
i can't

629
00:21:50,815 --> 00:21:53,665
all the um i think bookstores are

630
00:21:53,935 --> 00:21:57,115
nostalgic okay but all jobs suck i

631
00:21:57,145 --> 00:21:59,875
understand that as carrot top one said

632
00:21:59,875 --> 00:22:02,815
work socks i understand right mine

633
00:22:04,585 --> 00:22:06,145
but anyways they have all the toppings

634
00:22:06,145 --> 00:22:08,275
in little plastic containers and she just

635
00:22:08,275 --> 00:22:09,560
like collected the ones i wanted it

636
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:11,605
and i like really together later you

637
00:22:11,605 --> 00:22:13,315
don't get with just like put them

638
00:22:13,315 --> 00:22:14,395
on yourself and then they do it

639
00:22:14,395 --> 00:22:17,425
by weight anymore no no it's all

640
00:22:17,425 --> 00:22:18,775
just based on how many toppings you

641
00:22:18,775 --> 00:22:21,235
get and it just and then it

642
00:22:21,265 --> 00:22:24,085
also feels like it feels like covert

643
00:22:24,145 --> 00:22:25,138
you know i mean like it's like

644
00:22:25,165 --> 00:22:26,800
yeah i feel like there's something else

645
00:22:26,815 --> 00:22:28,315
now back to what the way it

646
00:22:28,315 --> 00:22:30,055
was but the other men cheese they

647
00:22:30,055 --> 00:22:31,225
do they put all the toppings on

648
00:22:31,225 --> 00:22:32,245
for you so i didn't know why

649
00:22:32,245 --> 00:22:33,295
this meant she's put them in a

650
00:22:33,295 --> 00:22:34,885
little buckets and all this shit i

651
00:22:34,885 --> 00:22:37,285
don't know look i just missed the

652
00:22:37,285 --> 00:22:38,575
before and i want to go back

653
00:22:38,575 --> 00:22:40,825
to how wow to get back but

654
00:22:40,915 --> 00:22:42,715
you know this is the future this

655
00:22:42,715 --> 00:22:43,585
is what it's like now

656
00:22:44,245 --> 00:22:46,105
it's just like it's just like well

657
00:22:46,135 --> 00:22:48,265
what movies we saw of of what

658
00:22:48,265 --> 00:22:49,555
the future would be everything's in a

659
00:22:49,555 --> 00:22:51,925
little container and that's food now

660
00:22:53,545 --> 00:22:56,727
would you paul would you if you

661
00:22:56,727 --> 00:22:59,215
were on a space ship like the

662
00:22:59,215 --> 00:23:02,455
enterprise sure to for example who would

663
00:23:02,455 --> 00:23:06,115
you like to eat from the food

664
00:23:06,115 --> 00:23:09,145
replicators or would you say no i

665
00:23:09,145 --> 00:23:11,125
would prefer to eat real food daily

666
00:23:11,485 --> 00:23:13,225
here's the thing wait

667
00:23:13,285 --> 00:23:15,058
specifically real food daily yes and only

668
00:23:15,058 --> 00:23:17,095
read your replicator every time

669
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:20,365
what is daily rule it's a vegan

670
00:23:20,365 --> 00:23:24,445
restaurant oh yeah totally familiar um i

671
00:23:24,445 --> 00:23:26,065
knew what that is here's the thing

672
00:23:26,095 --> 00:23:28,375
the only people that ever come plain

673
00:23:29,185 --> 00:23:31,105
ramen the only people that have many

674
00:23:32,065 --> 00:23:34,315
did some familiar to people like star

675
00:23:34,315 --> 00:23:35,935
trek that ever complained about the replicators

676
00:23:36,445 --> 00:23:38,065
are people who have never encountered one

677
00:23:38,065 --> 00:23:38,485
before

678
00:23:38,785 --> 00:23:41,305
or they're like so incredibly old or

679
00:23:41,305 --> 00:23:43,554
something well so what's a replicator the

680
00:23:43,554 --> 00:23:45,269
replicator just makes me feel like like

681
00:23:45,325 --> 00:23:47,095
a microwave but instead of heating something

682
00:23:47,095 --> 00:23:48,415
up it just makes whatever you want

683
00:23:48,685 --> 00:23:50,575
yes and that sounds good it just

684
00:23:50,575 --> 00:23:51,895
makes it appear but you never hear

685
00:23:51,895 --> 00:23:53,485
like the people on the enterprise saying

686
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:55,615
oh this foods this fake food sucks

687
00:23:55,645 --> 00:23:57,715
i feel like occasionally there's someone going

688
00:23:57,715 --> 00:23:58,585
like ah it's

689
00:23:58,645 --> 00:24:00,025
it's not the same in the replicator

690
00:24:00,235 --> 00:24:02,845
mostly they say that about booze but

691
00:24:03,055 --> 00:24:04,315
they do say it about booze but

692
00:24:04,315 --> 00:24:05,845
then like if if there's ever a

693
00:24:05,845 --> 00:24:07,825
character like the chief of or not

694
00:24:07,825 --> 00:24:09,685
chief but the deep space nine who

695
00:24:09,685 --> 00:24:12,835
like likes to cook these oh no

696
00:24:12,835 --> 00:24:14,545
you gotta do it yourself it's not

697
00:24:14,545 --> 00:24:15,865
the same in the yeah yeah i

698
00:24:15,865 --> 00:24:17,875
know but that's the they just do

699
00:24:17,875 --> 00:24:18,805
that when they when it's

700
00:24:18,805 --> 00:24:20,185
convenient for them to do that you

701
00:24:20,185 --> 00:24:22,255
know if they made replicators here on

702
00:24:22,255 --> 00:24:26,185
earth would you like say it tasted

703
00:24:26,185 --> 00:24:26,575
fine

704
00:24:28,075 --> 00:24:30,295
and you were like it's nine percent

705
00:24:30,295 --> 00:24:33,175
difference but it's fine what's the like

706
00:24:33,175 --> 00:24:36,475
vitamin quality and all good everything good

707
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:37,795
like why would i not have that

708
00:24:39,085 --> 00:24:40,495
but wait how often would you eat

709
00:24:40,495 --> 00:24:41,785
with it would you be every day

710
00:24:41,815 --> 00:24:43,795
l meals even a nine percent different

711
00:24:45,235 --> 00:24:47,275
every day every day all meals

712
00:24:49,135 --> 00:24:50,455
so i i could go my little

713
00:24:50,455 --> 00:24:51,235
microwave when i go

714
00:24:52,435 --> 00:24:54,235
working you know whatever and then it

715
00:24:54,235 --> 00:24:56,216
makes it i mean i don't know

716
00:24:56,216 --> 00:24:57,325
if it would do the burger king

717
00:24:57,325 --> 00:24:58,345
brand with vitamins

718
00:24:59,695 --> 00:25:02,005
no i pick that so i'd be

719
00:25:02,005 --> 00:25:04,165
like you'd probably say like burger you'd

720
00:25:04,165 --> 00:25:05,875

i think there's like it's such a

1139
00:40:44,575 --> 00:40:46,495
hard thing for me at least when

1140
00:40:46,495 --> 00:40:47,755
i get a haircut and i i

1141
00:40:47,785 --> 00:40:47,965

1142
00:40:47,995 --> 00:40:50,065

1143
00:40:50,965 --> 00:40:52,375

00:40:52,375 --> 00:40:53,682
when i wash it and stuff and

how they styled it or whatever exactly

1147
00:40:56,785 --> 00:40:58,795
and then i feel like self-conscious and

1148
00:40:58,795 --> 00:41:00,385
weird and then i leave and i'm

1149
00:41:00,385 --> 00:41:01,465
like i don't even know who i

1150
00:41:01,465 --> 00:41:02,935

a pizza restaurant right next door that

1222
00:43:36,895 --> 00:43:38,935
was delicious even if the robot had

1223
00:43:38,935 --> 00:43:40,975
hands and he didn't know wash i

1224
00:43:41,005 --> 00:43:42,655

one of those sort of random things

1226
00:43:44,725 --> 00:43:45,865

00:43:45,865 --> 00:43:48,595
night saying you know but i but

1228
00:43:48,655 --> 00:43:50,095
the best food ever isn't italy to

1229
00:43:50,095 --> 00:43:51,385
be it would feel silly to be

1230
00:43:51,385 --> 00:43:53,425
getting a pizza vending machine but also

1231
00:43:53,605 --> 00:43:53,935
when you're

1232
00:43:53,995 --> 00:43:55,375
traveling in other countries it's like really

1233
00:43:55,375 --> 00:43:57,295
fun to have vending machine food because

1234
00:43:57,295 --> 00:43:59,305
it's different i'm just saying that we

1235
00:43:59,305 --> 00:44:01,555
were on tour and remember all the

1236
00:44:01,555 --> 00:44:03,115
times that we've been out of luck

1237
00:44:03,115 --> 00:44:05,425
because every restaurant is closed yeah how

1238
00:44:05,485 --> 00:44:06,955
else really working out the hotel how

1239
00:44:06,955 --> 00:44:09,325
to how to pizza machine that would

1240
00:44:09,325 --> 00:44:10,915
be awesome that would be kind of

1241
00:44:10,975 --> 00:44:12,595
hang that it will never happen in

1242
00:44:12,595 --> 00:44:14,095
america because we can't be trusted

1243
00:44:14,125 --> 00:44:15,775
with a pizza robot what do you

1244
00:44:15,775 --> 00:44:18,535
mean because they will use it for

1245
00:44:18,565 --> 00:44:21,895
verb war they would never put a

1246
00:44:21,895 --> 00:44:24,505
pizza making vending machine on the street

1247
00:44:24,625 --> 00:44:26,065
anywhere and i feel like don't think

1248
00:44:26,065 --> 00:44:27,355
that would just never happen because we

1249
00:44:27,385 --> 00:44:29,395
were just told why they put redbox

1250
00:44:29,575 --> 00:44:31,825
in front of seven eleven do they

1251
00:44:31,825 --> 00:44:34,285
still yeah i think i don't know

1252
00:44:34,322 --> 00:44:35,995
i haven't been to redbox is very

1253
00:44:36,505 --> 00:44:38,365
good like a dvd way to measure

1254
00:44:38,365 --> 00:44:38,785
yourself

1255
00:44:40,765 --> 00:44:41,845
you can measure yourself i go to

1256
00:44:41,845 --> 00:44:44,485
seven eleven sell toys when you walk

1257
00:44:44,485 --> 00:44:45,925
in because there's that that numbers on

1258
00:44:45,925 --> 00:44:46,945
the side that are like yeah how

1259
00:44:46,945 --> 00:44:48,145
much you've grown since you came here

1260
00:44:48,145 --> 00:44:49,345

00:44:51,985 --> 00:44:53,305
how would i know i write my

00:48:43,945 --> 00:48:45,745
my hand i looked at it and

1371
00:48:45,745 --> 00:48:47,875

1372
00:48:47,875 --> 00:48:50,245

1373
00:48:50,245 --> 00:48:51,685
being terrorized outside

1374
00:48:53,425 --> 00:48:55,975

1375
00:48:57,325 --> 00:48:58,555
and then went inside and told her

1376
00:48:58,555 --> 00:48:59,845
what had happened and she laughed at

1377
00:48:59,845 --> 00:49:03,055
me and then the next day i

1378
00:49:03,055 --> 00:49:05,155

1379
00:49:05,185 --> 00:49:06,385
not apartment but the house we were

1380
00:49:06,385 --> 00:49:09,175
renting i turned the doorknob again and

1381
00:49:09,175 --> 00:49:10,975
the same frog jumped on my hand

1382
00:49:10,975 --> 00:49:13,735
to see crossing guard the sog and

1383
00:49:13,735 --> 00:49:15,595

frogs like home or something

1385
00:49:17,245 --> 00:49:18,835

if you like turn the doorknob it

1387
00:49:20,635 --> 00:49:23,545
would it would make vibrations or something

1388
00:49:23,545 --> 00:49:25,135
where he would or would get scared

is because this morning the first thing

1431
00:50:50,110 --> 00:50:51,010
i looked at my phone when i

1432
00:50:51,010 --> 00:50:52,690
woke up was tick tock my friend

1433
00:50:52,690 --> 00:50:54,850

1434
00:50:54,850 --> 00:50:56,440
disgusting thing i've ever seen

1435
00:50:58,210 --> 00:50:59,320
and it was this frog

1436
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:03,010
someone's like she's filming her pool and

1437
00:51:03,010 --> 00:51:04,630
there's like the string of like two

1438
00:51:04,630 --> 00:51:07,024
black strings a really long going like

1439
00:51:07,033 --> 00:51:08,159
the middle of the pool to this

1440
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:10,360
stairs and on the stairs there's this

1441
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:11,620
frog and it's like dead and it

1442
00:51:11,620 --> 00:51:13,486
has these strings command was ass and

1443
00:51:13,486 --> 00:51:16,300
then she starts pulling on them oh

1444
00:51:16,390 --> 00:51:17,560
and then the frogs are it's like

1445
00:51:17,830 --> 00:51:19,000
coming back to life a little bit

1446
00:51:19,150 --> 00:51:20,140
so she takes it out and she

1447
00:51:20,140 --> 00:51:20,500
puts it on

1448
00:51:20,530 --> 00:51:22,420
like a log and she starts pulling

1449
00:51:22,420 --> 00:51:23,860
the strings with gloves on now

1450
00:51:25,060 --> 00:51:26,050
and it's so gross

1451
00:51:26,890 --> 00:51:28,510
and then it goes on it goes

1452
00:51:28,510 --> 00:51:29,620
on for a long time and she

1453
00:51:29,650 --> 00:51:31,300
doesn't know what it is and then

1454
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:32,860
she has these two follow up videos

1455
00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:34,780
and there's all these people commenting and

1456
00:51:34,780 --> 00:51:37,450
basically it was this poisonous cane frog

1457
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:40,000
or something and it was having babies

1458
00:51:40,270 --> 00:51:42,160

1495
00:52:58,810 --> 00:53:01,600
credits dave shameka from stop podcasting yourself

1496
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:03,250
for the idea one person chooses a

1497
00:53:03,250 --> 00:53:04,690
song and plays it from their phone

1498
00:53:04,690 --> 00:53:06,580
without saying what it is another person

1499
00:53:06,580 --> 00:53:07,780
has to improvise over the beginning of

1500
00:53:07,780 --> 00:53:09,340
the song as a radio host right

1501
00:53:09,340 --> 00:53:11,290
up until the lyrics start the closer

1502
00:53:11,290 --> 00:53:13,000
the improviser times the natural end of

1503
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,110
their monologue to the beginning of the

1504
00:53:14,110 --> 00:53:15,970
lyrics the better if the improviser steps

1505
00:53:15,970 --> 00:53:16,060
in

1506
00:53:16,180 --> 00:53:19,845
