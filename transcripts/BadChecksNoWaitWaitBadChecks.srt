that you couldn't sleep on because it's

238
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:42,510
light on i mean my friend was

239
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:45,270
somehow very deep but completely uncomfortable right

240
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,860
my like where my best friends in

241
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,150
college who was a bit older than

242
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:49,500
me let just a few years but

243
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,670
at that time made a big difference

244
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:54,780
but he had a futon that folded

245
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:55,920
down it was like on a metal

246
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,230
frame yeah again it couldn't be

247
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:00,210
show because it was his couch as

248
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:02,280
well as his bed right but he

249
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,050
was never starving for pushy

250
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,370
how many did he have how many

251
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:08,820

00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:12,210
i like john i think five right

253
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:15,360

254
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,680
who's ever had sex with us back

255
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:17,970
to your previous point you know what

256
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:18,930
yes let's get that out of the

257
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:20,430
way in the first segment i think

258
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:24,000
men should think and women should do

259
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,500
whatever they want to regarding that i

260
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,060
don't think women should thank everyone i

261
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:28,350
think women should thank us i don't

262
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:28,710
think so

263
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:30,420
i'd appreciate

264
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,450
i mean how about waiting for thinking

265
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,430
about if it was good if it

266
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:36,900
was good yeah if it was good

267
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,120
and if it's not good i'll i'll

268
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:41,580
take a lie man i should thank

269
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:44,460

273
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:51,600
yeah i mean

274
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:52,920

land i just heard tale told by

315
00:11:15,995 --> 00:11:17,525
an idiot i heard you had to

316
00:11:17,525 --> 00:11:19,595
wait along like three wells so so

317
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:21,695
here's the tip this was like most

318
00:11:21,695 --> 00:11:23,765
people here to do and ultimately people

319
00:11:23,765 --> 00:11:25,175
told me that just the tip okay

320
00:11:25,205 --> 00:11:26,405
and i was and i was trying

321
00:11:26,405 --> 00:11:27,305
to avoid it but my nephews have

322
00:11:27,305 --> 00:11:28,535
been talking about it for a long

323
00:11:28,565 --> 00:11:30,815
time so they were really excited yeah

324
00:11:30,845 --> 00:11:31,655
to go and i was like we

325
00:11:31,655 --> 00:11:33,305
have to go to nintendo we have

326
00:11:33,305 --> 00:11:35,435
to ride on the the rise thankfully

327
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:37,175
the most important thing at universal for

328
00:11:37,175 --> 00:11:38,675
that thankfully our nephew did not care

329
00:11:38,675 --> 00:11:39,695
one way or the let's get his

330
00:11:39,695 --> 00:11:41,195
otherwise i mean it was my idea

331
00:11:41,195 --> 00:11:43,925
initially because it was seemed easier than

332
00:11:43,925 --> 00:11:45,605
disney which ultimately it was because i

333
00:11:45,605 --> 00:11:46,895
usually take them disney don't buy it

334
00:11:47,555 --> 00:11:48,395
so they took the fast one

335
00:11:48,725 --> 00:11:52,835
so anyways we'd everyone said get get

336
00:11:52,844 --> 00:11:54,545
the early pass so okay right off

337
00:11:54,545 --> 00:11:55,835
the batter there for now right after

338
00:11:55,835 --> 00:11:57,905
that the ticket to be the tickets

339
00:11:57,905 --> 00:11:59,885
are based are not one solid price

340
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:02,015
it's every day they're there they vary

341
00:12:02,015 --> 00:12:04,025
slightly so why pick a popular day

342
00:12:04,025 --> 00:12:06,305
it's more expensive all come on and

343
00:12:06,305 --> 00:12:08,855
then on universal dando

344
00:12:08,885 --> 00:12:11,375
and you should be universal basic ticket

345
00:12:11,405 --> 00:12:13,261
price it should be and then just

346
00:12:13,261 --> 00:12:16,745
this springsteen suddenly thirty dollars me that

347
00:12:16,745 --> 00:12:19,295
per person to get into early access

348
00:12:19,295 --> 00:12:20,645
yes all right i'm going these tickets

349
00:12:20,645 --> 00:12:23,165
are about to eat rival disneyland prices

350
00:12:23,345 --> 00:12:24,875
yeah and there's not there's not much

351
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:28,235
to do yeah and then we get

352
00:12:28,235 --> 00:12:28,837

353
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,335

00:17:16,925 --> 00:17:18,515
think i can do it i i

511
00:17:18,515 --> 00:17:19,175
could i feel like

512
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:21,095
i could do it if i somehow

513
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:23,075
had the park ulta myself yeah that's

514
00:17:23,075 --> 00:17:24,425
how i felt too hey when i

515
00:17:24,455 --> 00:17:26,015
think about being rented rented out just

516
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:26,915
you know you don't wanna stand in

517
00:17:26,915 --> 00:17:27,875
line with kids

518
00:17:29,435 --> 00:17:31,175
just ya

519
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:32,855
yes too if i was rich that's

520
00:17:32,855 --> 00:17:34,355
what i would do yeah yeah those

521
00:17:34,355 --> 00:17:36,455
are for school and and rents ranging

522
00:17:36,546 --> 00:17:38,195
instead of water it would be chuckled

523
00:17:38,195 --> 00:17:39,995
but that is honestly it's not that

524
00:17:39,995 --> 00:17:41,615
much different than how billionaires are i

525
00:17:41,615 --> 00:17:43,655
was thinking about that today like all

526
00:17:43,655 --> 00:17:45,365
the shit that they don't do that

527
00:17:45,365 --> 00:17:47,645
would be beneficial it's so annoying it's

528
00:17:47,645 --> 00:17:48,785
like i'm going to build rockets it

529
00:17:48,785 --> 00:17:51,035
was already well awesome if i had

530
00:17:51,035 --> 00:17:51,125
a

531
00:17:51,335 --> 00:17:53,015
billion dollars to find a billion dollars

532
00:17:53,015 --> 00:17:55,175
i would rent raging waters well sure

533
00:17:55,175 --> 00:17:56,735
that would be one oh my what's

534
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:58,745
like thousand dollars and you're done my

535
00:17:58,745 --> 00:18:00,695
one luxury thing like it has to

536
00:18:00,695 --> 00:18:01,925
be more than a thousand i'm sure

537
00:18:01,925 --> 00:18:03,125
it is it's gotta be at least

538
00:18:03,155 --> 00:18:05,075
i wonder how much for one day

539
00:18:05,105 --> 00:18:07,385
my eleven hundred dollars it's no it's

540
00:18:07,385 --> 00:18:09,455
gotta be i'd say twenty thousand right

541
00:18:10,205 --> 00:18:12,095
oh wow i've been on a waterslide

542
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:13,595
since i was a kid who give

543
00:18:13,595 --> 00:18:16,415
me guglielmi but i one thing i

544
00:18:16,415 --> 00:18:18,395
remember about them and i'm i assume

545
00:18:18,455 --> 00:18:19,745
a place like raging waters is better

546
00:18:19,745 --> 00:18:22,235
than my local you know little pool

547
00:18:22,235 --> 00:18:24,005
open pool with water water slides kind

548
00:18:24,005 --> 00:18:24,725
of thing that i would go to

549
00:18:24,725 --> 00:18:26,405
as a kid that wasn't a water

550
00:18:26,405 --> 00:18:28,925
park it was a place with slides

551
00:18:29,105 --> 00:18:29,405
right

552
00:18:30,095 --> 00:18:32,826
but those ridges in the slide like

553
00:18:32,826 --> 00:18:34,385
so yeah and a slice you can

554
00:18:34,415 --> 00:18:35,945
measure like your bag is in the

555
00:18:35,953 --> 00:18:38,435

the entire day watching and pump room

626
00:21:17,235 --> 00:21:19,815
as hurricanes intended it was kind of

627
00:21:19,815 --> 00:21:22,275
exciting it's in the way if you

628
00:21:22,275 --> 00:21:24,375

it's scary what happened in certain areas

631
00:21:29,475 --> 00:21:30,945
but once we sort of realised it

632
00:21:31,095 --> 00:21:33,225
wasn't going to be that crazy in

633
00:21:33,225 --> 00:21:35,085
our area yeah you could just enjoy

634
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:36,435
a rainy day a little bit because

635
00:21:36,435 --> 00:21:37,575
we never get rain like that so

636
00:21:37,575 --> 00:21:38,895

00:22:41,055 --> 00:22:44,745
plenty of warning yeah if that should

671
00:22:44,805 --> 00:22:46,065
yeah once you get one inch you

672
00:22:46,065 --> 00:22:47,265

i've heard that you have some tree

708
00:23:54,885 --> 00:23:57,255
damage and we have tree damage so

709
00:23:57,285 --> 00:23:58,845
true damage there was a point when

710
00:23:58,845 --> 00:24:00,345
i was just kind of putting around

711
00:24:00,345 --> 00:24:02,235
the house and i saw spending caught

712
00:24:02,265 --> 00:24:03,045
my eye in the window and i

713
00:24:03,045 --> 00:24:04,155
thought oh it's been almost flew at

714
00:24:04,155 --> 00:24:05,115
the window but then i looked up

715
00:24:05,115 --> 00:24:06,375
and there was nothing out there and

716
00:24:06,375 --> 00:24:09,086
then puttering yeah what's putting nothing it's

717
00:24:09,086 --> 00:24:09,645
another thing

718
00:24:12,765 --> 00:24:15,165
okay and then if you a little

719
00:24:15,165 --> 00:24:17,535
bit later i realized that it was

720
00:24:17,535 --> 00:24:19,185
actually a huge tree branch that had

721
00:24:19,185 --> 00:24:20,205
fallen and it was on the ground

722
00:24:20,205 --> 00:24:21,405
but i didn't notice it when i

723
00:24:21,405 --> 00:24:23,655
looked on tight pants yeah on the

724
00:24:23,655 --> 00:24:26,115
ground right german roads and then throughout

725
00:24:26,115 --> 00:24:29,685
the day big huge branches were falling

726
00:24:29,715 --> 00:24:30,855
and they all fell right into the

727
00:24:30,915 --> 00:24:32,565
path so it wasn't dangerous right like

728
00:24:32,727 --> 00:24:34,185
none of them were now like above

729
00:24:34,185 --> 00:24:35,745
the house or anything like that oh

730
00:24:35,745 --> 00:24:36,825
i don't know that i'm aware of

731
00:24:37,305 --> 00:24:39,525
and but everyone was like why is

732
00:24:39,525 --> 00:24:41,025
this happening to you because it's not

735
00:24:46,995 --> 00:24:49,245

you know the good thing is the

764
00:25:42,525 --> 00:25:43,995
bees probably weren't in there because of

765
00:25:43,995 --> 00:25:45,435
the rain and they all got away

00:26:32,235 --> 00:26:36,045
film people go drones drones drones which

791
00:26:36,045 --> 00:26:37,335

00:26:57,345 --> 00:26:59,085
you're both are always kind of being

801
00:26:59,085 --> 00:27:01,155
a queen bean garbanzo like i'm thinking

802
00:27:01,155 --> 00:27:02,865
of like if there's a in every

803
00:27:02,865 --> 00:27:05,145
can of beans there's one there's one

804
00:27:05,145 --> 00:27:06,555
clean queen bee it's the one who

805
00:27:06,555 --> 00:27:08,175
knows it's the most important should do

806
00:27:08,175 --> 00:27:09,375
that because it's like any other beans

807
00:27:09,375 --> 00:27:10,455
protected cracker jacks

808
00:27:10,545 --> 00:27:12,495
so fun and they got so popular

809
00:27:12,495 --> 00:27:14,535
because of the priors yeah so far

810
00:27:14,565 --> 00:27:16,395
you would buy more beans if you

811
00:27:16,425 --> 00:27:18,405
like were able to get the queen

812
00:27:18,405 --> 00:27:19,275

813
00:27:19,275 --> 00:27:20,955
fair to say cracker jacks none of

814
00:27:20,955 --> 00:27:24,135
peanuts mix it up yeah that's why

816
00:27:25,635 --> 00:27:27,525

the hurricane so our our rain level

834
00:27:58,215 --> 00:28:01,935

i was texting you like we're not

836
00:28:03,045 --> 00:28:05,325
getting anything and then at a certain

837
00:28:05,325 --> 00:28:08,055
point it came down kinda hard and

838
00:28:08,055 --> 00:28:09,735
for about maybe an hour and i

839
00:28:09,742 --> 00:28:12,675
was at it honestly hot rained harder

840
00:28:12,795 --> 00:28:14,295
earlier in the year oh my god

841
00:28:14,295 --> 00:28:16,665
yeah like the bro that was insane

842
00:28:16,665 --> 00:28:18,045
i had yeah so many weeks

843
00:28:18,195 --> 00:28:19,725

844
00:28:19,755 --> 00:28:23,355
earthquake happened and paul what was your

845
00:28:23,355 --> 00:28:26,175

roofie we feel she's dying on the

849
00:28:32,265 --> 00:28:34,185
roof but she's poised she's standing on

850
00:28:34,185 --> 00:28:36,405
the climb she's standing on there going

851
00:28:36,735 --> 00:28:38,265
is that all you got

852
00:28:38,415 --> 00:28:40,035

so we we feel the house shaking

855
00:28:46,335 --> 00:28:48,945
and then we of course we even

856
00:28:48,945 --> 00:28:52,185
though we know one of us will

857

look at the other say an earthquake

858
00:28:54,075 --> 00:28:55,545
yeah because of course it could be

859
00:28:55,545 --> 00:28:56,895
a weather related thing where it's like

860
00:28:56,895 --> 00:28:58,575
your house is blowing down oh marsh

861
00:28:58,575 --> 00:29:01,215

it was it was kind of rolling

866
00:29:11,085 --> 00:29:13,995
for a while really and you're thinking

867
00:29:14,145 --> 00:29:15,555

a dark thick dark chocolate or something

1120
00:38:18,539 --> 00:38:20,885
you'd have a particular kind of dark

1121
00:38:20,975 --> 00:38:22,175
although i have to say it's like

1122
00:38:22,175 --> 00:38:24,215

five thirty cents something like that i

1127
00:38:30,815 --> 00:38:31,650

know but but you would save up

1131
00:38:37,535 --> 00:38:39,605
allowance and stuff i still think about

1132
00:38:39,605 --> 00:38:42,125
like how crazy it is to that

1133
00:38:42,125 --> 00:38:44,585

so giant and you're so little

1135
00:38:47,915 --> 00:38:49,325

slim and petite

1143
00:39:04,895 --> 00:39:07,955
shanda what has more mass a three

um i would say her she has

1148
00:39:18,455 --> 00:39:20,555
more mass it feels like in my

1149
00:39:20,555 --> 00:39:22,596
mind the hershey bar is heavier than

1150
00:39:22,596 --> 00:39:23,735
