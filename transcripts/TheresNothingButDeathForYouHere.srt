43
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,580
speck of dust went into my eye

00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:27,840
and i had to wear that eyepatch

45
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,330
for like months alright and and then

46
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:31,440
i remember like so

47
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:33,090
nobody tried to pull that speck of

48
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:34,230
dust out they had a plank in

49
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:36,090
their own eye yes and you were

50
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:36,870
like you're a hypocrite

51
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:39,810
and he was jesus christ also you

54
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,510
trying to get a speck of dust

55
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:46,950

idea oh yeah i want a tear

63
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:01,830
here is the idea in the bible

64
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:03,900
that you're pulling the speck out of

65
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:07,108
your neighbor's eye for aesthetic reasons you're

66
00:02:07,108 --> 00:02:09,120
like pleases news doesn't fit in with

67
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,610

all just out of sight whoa like

79
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:35,940
i'm just interested in me as someone

80
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:37,740
who didn't grow up religious yeah

81
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,680
good page doesn't come up a lot

82
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:42,360
would have to read what occasion would

83
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,680
like someone's wedding where they have a

84
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,570
paper that has like oh yeah like

85
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:46,920
a thing in it or like evolve

86
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,200

00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:58,050
know it's

91
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,640
funny how little the bible comes up

92
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,110
in your life if you are not

93
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:03,180
actively trying to insert it yeah life

94
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:05,220
yeah yeah yeah is the okay so

95
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:07,830
christianity my theory on it is oh

96
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:09,750
no here we go worst part about

97
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,610
it is the part where they because

98
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,650
i remember just being at church and

99
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:14,970
going like hey this is all cool

100
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,150
until like around ten or something when

101
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:21,780
pm ten pm yeah suddenly the freaks

102
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:22,200
were coming

103
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:25,410
no check them out at night to

104
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:28,140
church because i'm mad i teacher trish

105
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:31,170
um no at like ten years old

106
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:34,290
i remember one of the the pastor

107
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:37,890
saying okay it's not good enough that

108
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:40,410
you are a christian part of being

109
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:42,330
a christian is you have to go

110
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,440
actively recur

111
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,140
fruit all the time and if you

112
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:48,180
know anyone who's not a christian you

113
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:50,340
have to convince them to be one

114
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:52,245
or else you can't hang out with

115
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,030
him anymore it's ok not to do

116
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:54,390
that

117
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,810
i think normalize not doing that's like

118
00:03:57,810 --> 00:03:59,670
the root of all of the problems

119
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:03,900
in in like religious you know behavior

120
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:06,450
i think is is the evangelizing part

121
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:07,770
of it how many people do you

122
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:10,530
think that are the this is people

123
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:12,210
getting mad if i say this oh

124
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,340
but people that are that are true

125
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:15,600
christians that actually

126
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,860
really are compassionate loving people as opposed

127
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:22,740
to just what feels like very american

128
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:25,260
christianity which is like just judgment yeah

129
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:28,410
we're right that's that's what yeah it

130
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:29,760
seems like it all is yeah if

131
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:30,960
you're not a christian you're a bad

132
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,460
person yeah like how many people do

133
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:33,660
you think that are christ like i

134
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:35,430
mean not even christ was like that

135
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:35,760
because he

136
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:39,030
cursed then victory oh he hated that

137
00:04:39,035 --> 00:04:40,740
fig tree he was he was angry

138
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,890
and he was angry it's the first

139
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:47,760
recorded instance of hanger oh he'll shoreline

140
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,500
the term do you know the story

141
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,410
um no this one is walking down

142
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:55,320
the street the other day okay he's

143
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:55,710
hungry

144
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:57,720
he goes to a fig tree i

145
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,920
think this is at a point where

146
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,380
he's like he's he's over the whole

147
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:02,100
thing i think i'm going to be

148
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:05,040
crucified yeah okay so he's going it's

149
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,300
kind of sinking in he's like this

150
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,100
whole plenary two and a half yeah

151
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:10,830
and so he's in the middle i

152
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:12,450
feel like in this this is my

153
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:14,790
hazy recollection of this he's in the

154
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:16,080
middle of giving something lesnar

155
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:18,120
back someday when he's full of righteous

156
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:21,210
anger and then he he's hungry once

157
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:22,290
to get a fig from this fig

158
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:24,240
tree fig tree doesn't have any figs

159
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,670
on it so he fuckin curses it

160
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:30,150
to wither and never bear fruit again

161
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,520
and i think the fig tree is

162
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:35,700
a metaphor for a woman wow

163
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,010
stretching himself

164
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:41,310
ah

165
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:44,370
i'm staying out of it you're saying

166
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,810
out of it because we have i

167
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:47,580
don't play don't know well i know

168
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,890
we have religious listeners i think religions

169
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:51,960
fine if you want to do it

170
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:54,990
and just keep it to yourself that's

171
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:57,630
that's my tip on religion but it

172
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:59,520
is i you know of course the

173
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:01,590
gva ball the thing is you're trying

174
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:02,640
to the idea

175
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:05,400
is you're trying to save people by

176
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:08,220
converting them to christianity yeah here it

177
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:09,990
is the parable of the barren fig

178
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:12,630
tree not to be confused with parable

179
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:15,150
of the budding fig tree there's ana

180
00:06:15,152 --> 00:06:16,710
to fig really ever heard of but

181
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,150
i wouldn't get confused because they have

182
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:21,690
very different abilities yeah um

183
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:25,080
wait a minute this is terrible not

184
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:28,230
that jesus did it himself oh does

185
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:29,670
he oh he talks about it as

186
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:31,890
if someone else did it a man

187

any fruit when he reached it he

221
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,540

223
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,360

225
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,720

237
00:08:17,089 --> 00:08:19,590
that cheek hers to that tree it's

238
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:23,190

240
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,640
next season what did you expect

241
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:30,150
spec to you think this alone i

242
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:33,870
think invalidates christ as worthy of founding

243
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:36,390
a religion upon yeah i am and

244
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:37,710
i would say they talk about how

245
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:38,760
he's never sinned

246
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:43,140
add sin i think that's a step

247
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:45,990
counts wrath yeah if that's not wrath

248
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:48,120
what is what is wrath cursing someone

249
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:48,720
as a sin

250
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:51,690
i mean just do

251
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,720

00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:00,420
not getting what you want

255
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,450
for no fault of the other thing

256
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:07,380
and then and then ah enacting consequences

257
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,658
because you didn't get what you want

258
00:09:08,765 --> 00:09:11,400
that is a sin because you were

259
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,860

00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,070
to do and at the end i

389
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:09,310

390
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:12,190

was of course he was not pleased

394
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:21,010
about that and thankfully the editors left

395
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:23,080
it in good like that didn't need

396
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:26,770
to be in awe why they never

397
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:28,360
would never occurred to me that i

398
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,440
would have to say oh

399
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:30,820
by the way cut out the part

400
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:31,930
where i called the guest the wrong

401
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:34,600
name yeah yeah shh that's so no

402
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,890
they also i wanted to pitch that

403
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:37,420
as a tv show and the editors

404
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:39,280
put together a reel that did not

405
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:39,880
include me in it

406
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:43,150
it was just all the guests why

407
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:44,920

408
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:46,990

00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:53,980
but wait so in in the wire

412
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:57,640

just like figure we get either people

426
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:28,240
like this i think it's if i

00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,950
don't get that way if i remember

428
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:33,459
it's four seasons of thirty four season

429
00:15:33,459 --> 00:15:34,600
of ten or thirteen and then the

430
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:36,520
the fifth season is like six or

431
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,630
eight team yeah yeah

432
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:40,930

433
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:42,160
symbol tattooed on the back of his

434
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:43,780
neck and is it actually on his

435
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:45,100
body though and maybe that's a good

436
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:47,620
question and i don't know but either

437
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:49,900
way if it's actually his body cover

438
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,220
that shit up why did that character

439
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:54,220

00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:57,790
tattoo do

442
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:00,280

00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:12,670

451
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,180
questionnaire and i told him hold on

452
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:24,040
hold on there's

453
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:28,810
there's a reddit thread we don't have

454
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:31,630
tattoos halfway through season three with that

455
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,970
wondering why nick and season two has

456
00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:36,520
a pie tattoo on the back of

457
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,260
his neck there you go oh my

458
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:39,970
god it's just deeper and deeper than

459
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:41,710
a bunch of people just surmising things

460
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:45,070
i think it's cause this tiny minuscule

461
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:45,310
deter

462
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:47,320
yale was probably my biggest gripe with

463
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,150
season two oh no i sound like

464
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:51,462
the person i cannot for the lowest

465
00:16:51,462 --> 00:16:53,260
time you imagine a reason why nixon

466
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:55,030
buchu would ever have a tattoo like

467
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:57,520

doesn't always work that way these people

630
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:28,370
thinking like true deer he wouldn't get

631
00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:30,140
a pi tattoo like his character wouldn't

632
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:30,590

633
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:33,020
he's a stupid dock worker like stupid

634
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:34,880
people get dumb tattoos and stuff all

635
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,440
the time it's not that he's stupid

636
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,870
it's that there's nothing in the character

637
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:42,020
doesn't talk about his deferred today march

638
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:44,840

639
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:46,160

647
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:12,650
and we're back and have you learned

648
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:14,030
if you ever thought about getting a

649
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:16,610
tattoo i recently sort of had the

650
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,020
urge like a couple of weeks ago

651
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:20,840
i was like thinking about that randomly

652
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:21,890
and but i was like but i

653
00:23:21,890 --> 00:23:23,780
really still don't i really don't know

654
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:24,320
what it would be

655
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:25,460
i really feel like i have to

656
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:28,190
really like whatever it is cause i

657
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:29,630
could see myself because you wanted it

658
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:32,960
like aesthetically somewhere and yeah be cool

659
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,550
to have something there yeah but i

660
00:23:34,610 --> 00:23:36,410
meant even you know spot as much

661
00:23:36,410 --> 00:23:39,050
as i sort of understood people getting

662
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:41,210
them more and not that i don't

663
00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:42,830
understand it but i mean for me

664
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:43,790
it's always been like i need to

665
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:44,510
have a very specific

666
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:47,090
the thing right other people are more

667
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,590
like indiscriminate about what again i think

668
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:49,610
that's also cool and i think once

669
00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:51,080
you get one you're more open to

670
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,550
getting up on trent it's less like

671
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:55,460
a big deal but i um i

672
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:56,780
think would have to be very finely

673
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:57,980
drawn and i think it should be

674
00:23:58,010 --> 00:24:00,080
small and i have to really like

675
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,430
it what about i don't know dog

676
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:02,930
if it looks like a cartoon character

677
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:04,670
i should like an artist read wow

look at dog they chose brand is

686
00:24:23,090 --> 00:24:26,870
fully explore yeah falling out slide i've

687
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:29,480
never i've never seriously thought about getting

688
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:31,160
a tattoo probably the most i thought

689
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:33,230
i ever gave it was when i

690
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:35,330
was in my twenties and started to

691
00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:38,030
know people who had tons of tattoos

692
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:39,140
and

693
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:40,760
thinking about what would it be but

694
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:43,310
i never there was never any image

695
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:45,320
that i could ever generate there was

696
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:47,270
like yes that's it yeah

697
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:51,830
i think growing up it was it's

698
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:53,540
so strange because i think growing up

699
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:56,090
in a religious household there are things

700
00:24:56,090 --> 00:24:58,130
that the bible doesn't talk about that

701
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:01,190
just my household considered to be sins

702
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:03,470
or whatever and so getting a tattoo

703
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:04,340
was like

704
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:06,800
i don't know whether it was considered

705
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,240
a sin or something that you just

706
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,040
shouldn't do is something my family was

707
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:12,380
really yeah against it my i my

708
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:13,970
parents were like oh my mom was

709
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:15,440
always like you don't ever get a

710
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:17,570
tattoo remember when i'm protecting us from

711
00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:19,370
getting teenage things or something but i

712
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:21,230
don't know maybe they're one of the

713
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:22,850
people at our church had one he

714
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:24,680

epic classic and it was always like

717
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:30,530
anytime he would be in shirtsleeves it

718
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:31,940
would be like oh my god he

719
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:33,410

720
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,400

00:26:15,770 --> 00:26:18,170
i watched it on the plane so

741
00:26:18,170 --> 00:26:19,940

five now we just passed the new

748
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:33,260
orleans episodes legendary time in the show's

749
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:37,438
history um but the third doctor it's

750
00:26:37,438 --> 00:26:38,540
so funny that we watched so much

751
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:40,250
reality and yet you picked a show

752
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:41,930
that neither of us have seen i

753
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:43,730
know it's strange i mean i've seen

754
00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:46,190
the recent season that was coy

755
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:48,350
that's a bitcoin so that's that's okay

756
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,060
so i know that people he's talking

757
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:51,581
about you know what the scan tool

758
00:26:51,581 --> 00:26:53,180
is and don't tell me and i

759
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:55,220
have seen clips from the past of

760
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:58,730
things happening but i've just vague notions

761
00:26:58,730 --> 00:26:59,930
of what when they showed like black

762
00:26:59,930 --> 00:27:00,920
and white but then there's one thing

763
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:03,050
in color yeah that's their that's only

764
00:27:03,050 --> 00:27:05,810
do the flashback um so the third

765
00:27:05,810 --> 00:27:06,350
doctor

766
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:08,360
in his first episode a man named

767
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:11,270
jon pertwee was the actor um who

768
00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:13,670
was in world war two and his

769
00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:15,350
first episode has a scene where

770
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:18,920
he is trying to hide from some

771
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:21,080
people so he takes off his clothes

772
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:22,250
and he gets in a shower in

773
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:24,620
this locker room and you see like

774
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:25,850
that's how i like to hide from

775
00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:27,800
people this is fucking green puts on

776
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:30,080
a shower cap and it's like singing

777
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,270
your song yeah like scrubbing in the

778
00:27:32,270 --> 00:27:34,640
show like running away you wouldn't be

779
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,990
the person doing i mean they're not

780
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:36,590
chasing

781
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:39,980
him they're just looking ok so but

782
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:41,270
you see we were looking for a

783
00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:43,460
head closer you see not only zealand

784
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:44,810
does he have like a shower he

785
00:27:44,810 --> 00:27:46,580
doesn't get a tattoo on his arm

786
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:47,900
right because he was in the hip

787
00:27:47,925 --> 00:27:48,890
i think it was linked the merchant

788
00:27:48,890 --> 00:27:50,990
marines is right but you also see

789
00:27:51,016 --> 00:27:52,730
like kind of his upper ass like

790
00:27:52,730 --> 00:27:54,616
you see his tan line and the

791
00:27:54,616 --> 00:27:56,240
white of his what episode is this

792
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:56,750
i gotta check

793
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:59,593
this out time stamp it's so weird

794
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:01,400
it's very very one as well as

795
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:03,740
their wiki my years on theirs wikihouse

796
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:07,003
of course this was the late sixth

797
00:28:07,003 --> 00:28:08,840
late sixty s yeah it's crazy it's

798
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:11,600
pretty shocking yeah um and they never

799
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,370
explained the tattoo way of like oh

800
00:28:13,370 --> 00:28:14,538
the doctor got a tattoo or it

801
00:28:14,538 --> 00:28:16,880
wasn't was he regenerating rejected and

802
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:19,010
what i got a tattoo you imagine

803
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:20,300
you're a whole new body and there's

804
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:22,820
a tattoo always already doctor ever regenerated

805
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:25,790
as a baby and then that and

806
00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:27,440
then like thirty years later we catch

807
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,150
up with him and he's whoever i've

808
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:31,220
waited my whole life show starring a

809
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:32,360
toddler i would not mind but it's

810
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:34,370
just doing nostra toddler stuff and there

811
00:28:34,370 --> 00:28:36,980
yeah yeah alright alright well

812
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:38,150
i think that waiting for him to

813
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:39,620
grow up so he saves the world

814
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:41,990
yeah actually zine good doctor who episode

815
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:43,430
is like he regenerates and he's a

816
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:45,290
baby it's like oh no he did

817
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:47,510
one time become so old that he

818
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:50,300
became a tiny little creature i know

819
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:51,740
is there really no episode where he's

820
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:54,140
a baby know that feels like a

821
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,700
feels like come on what are we

822
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:57,230
doing but there's like a zillion eps

823
00:28:57,230 --> 00:28:58,490
assos i feel like they would have

824
00:28:58,490 --> 00:29:00,440
eventually gotten there i think we have

825
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:02,630
seen him in flashbacks as a child

826
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:04,670
or they i shouldn't say yeah wild

827
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:05,960
yeah but i don't think as a

828
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:08,000
as a baby maybe not well yeah

829
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,580
the original well anyway we're getting way

830
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:13,880
but yeah but so the different doctors

831
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:16,400
all represent one person yeah but every

832
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,390
time same person

833
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:19,730
same person yeah every time they die

834
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,650
oh i thought it was just like

835
00:29:21,770 --> 00:29:23,776
we're revealing this story with a woman

836
00:29:23,810 --> 00:29:25,580
now and it's this oh it's it's

837
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:27,020
like a clever thing where like the

838
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:28,700
first doctor who had to have to

839
00:29:28,730 --> 00:29:30,620
bolt and so they were like we

840
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:31,910
don't want to end the show right

841
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:33,200
and so yeah he was getting a

842
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,520
little too frail to do the show

843
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:36,170
anymore so they came up with the

844
00:29:36,170 --> 00:29:37,550
idea of regeneration

845
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:38,960
in in which that it'll be the

846
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,730
same character but he'll just look different

847
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:43,070
yeah huh and so and it's genie

848
00:29:43,071 --> 00:29:44,840
although they said a number on it

849
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:47,420
that seemed unattached unobtainable at the time

850
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:48,740
i was like fourteen or something like

851
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:50,480
twelve twelve yeah okay like well it's

852
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,370
never gonna never get to read dr

853
00:29:52,370 --> 00:29:54,200
yeah and they passed twelve already and

854
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,833
had to justify it yeah yeah but

855
00:29:56,833 --> 00:29:57,710
yeah it's it's very

856
00:29:57,710 --> 00:29:59,300
the inch in and in fact when

857
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:01,610
reggie left comedy bang bang we were

858
00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:05,810
considering having him regenerates sue whoever that

859
00:30:05,810 --> 00:30:07,730
person was but we liked the episode

860
00:30:07,730 --> 00:30:10,220
we came yeah yeah okay yeah you

861
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:11,450
like it you don't have regrets about

862
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:12,620
it i don't know if that episode

863
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:14,720
no regrets um and then do you

864
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:17,120
have a tattoo you want to know

865
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:17,870
i so so

866
00:30:17,870 --> 00:30:19,880
so i just i i also think

867
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,410
that okay growing up in the eighties

868
00:30:21,410 --> 00:30:23,390
i also feel like the nancy reagan

869
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:25,100
thing of like just say no people

870
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:26,300
make fun of it but i also

871
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:27,530
think it kind of worked in a

872
00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:29,600
way because like people would offer me

873
00:30:29,630 --> 00:30:30,950
drugs i'd be like oh no thanks

874
00:30:30,950 --> 00:30:32,330
you know and it's like instead of

875
00:30:32,690 --> 00:30:34,190
ever getting gilded into it it was

876
00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:36,890
like no yeah and so this couldn't

877
00:30:36,890 --> 00:30:38,030
be just say no thing

878
00:30:38,775 --> 00:30:40,155

kids who are like are now do

966
00:34:07,695 --> 00:34:10,905
you think vampires are real yeah i

967
00:34:10,905 --> 00:34:12,435
would say like is going to crowd

968
00:34:12,435 --> 00:34:13,815
scene in a movie ten percent of

969
00:34:13,815 --> 00:34:15,915
the popular actually vampires okay yeah what's

970
00:34:15,915 --> 00:34:18,495
more realistic to you aliens or vampires

971
00:34:18,855 --> 00:34:19,665
more realistic

972
00:34:19,725 --> 00:34:21,105
what's more likely to be something we're

973
00:34:21,105 --> 00:34:22,635
going to encounter okay i would say

974
00:34:22,635 --> 00:34:24,885
aliens are more realistic although i'm not

975
00:34:24,945 --> 00:34:26,745
necessarily in the camp these days who

976
00:34:26,745 --> 00:34:28,845
are like oh yeah all these whistleblowers

977
00:34:28,845 --> 00:34:30,315
are telling the truth i think like

978
00:34:30,315 --> 00:34:31,035
they're all insane

979
00:34:32,715 --> 00:34:35,655
it's like their city government i think

980
00:34:35,655 --> 00:34:37,605
that's real okay you think the government's

981
00:34:37,605 --> 00:34:38,475
insane

982
00:34:40,545 --> 00:34:42,705
um i so i think aliens are

983
00:34:42,795 --> 00:34:45,585
more real than vampires i don't think

984
00:34:45,585 --> 00:34:47,475
there's any evidence of any vampires i

985
00:34:47,475 --> 00:34:48,645
don't think there's any i think i

986
00:34:48,645 --> 00:34:50,595
don't think there's any event i will

987
00:34:50,595 --> 00:34:51,525
jane and i were talking about the

988
00:34:51,555 --> 00:34:55,155
aliens last night and she thinks she's

989
00:34:55,155 --> 00:34:57,315
thinking like i'm i'm she was saying

990
00:34:57,345 --> 00:34:59,205
i'm starting to think they're

991
00:34:59,295 --> 00:35:01,095
actually going to come like their actual

992
00:35:01,095 --> 00:35:03,315
wow and i said

993
00:35:04,875 --> 00:35:07,815
i welcome them either way either they're

994
00:35:07,815 --> 00:35:08,805
going to come and save us from

995
00:35:08,805 --> 00:35:11,205
ourselves or they're gonna come and obliterate

996
00:35:11,205 --> 00:35:13,485
us isn't that saving us from ourselves

997
00:35:13,635 --> 00:35:14,085
you know

998
00:35:15,225 --> 00:35:16,305
i will tell the aliens what i

999
00:35:16,305 --> 00:35:17,835
tell ants when they come into my

1000
00:35:17,835 --> 00:35:19,425
house there's nothing but death for you

1001
00:35:19,425 --> 00:35:21,705
here yes what you say to ants

1002
00:35:22,575 --> 00:35:24,735
until it's give your aunt telepathy to

1003
00:35:24,735 --> 00:35:26,625
all your own friends there's nothing but

1004
00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:28,215
death for you leave us alive and

1005
00:35:28,215 --> 00:35:30,015
say go tell the others yeah

1006
00:35:35,385 --> 00:35:37,155
i feel like the alien thing is

1007
00:35:37,605 --> 00:35:40,485
sort of like the rapture we're all

1008
00:35:40,605 --> 00:35:41,865
like oh it's gonna come it's gonna

1009
00:35:41,865 --> 00:35:42,675
come we're all going to die and

1010
00:35:42,702 --> 00:35:45,255
it'll never happen okay but it might

1011
00:35:45,255 --> 00:35:47,955
happen after we die oh no and

1012
00:35:47,955 --> 00:35:49,095
then they get here and they're like

1013
00:35:49,155 --> 00:35:51,585
oh we waited oil and da

1014
00:35:51,598 --> 00:35:53,055
and it's god when we were listening

1015
00:35:53,115 --> 00:35:56,175
three of roscoe clean american quadrant i

1016
00:35:56,175 --> 00:35:58,545
can't believe your lifespans when a hundred

1017
00:35:58,545 --> 00:35:59,895
years you think there'll be an episode

1018
00:35:59,895 --> 00:36:01,605
of freedom on the golden record that

1019
00:36:01,605 --> 00:36:03,315
they play for aliens yeah they keep

1020
00:36:03,315 --> 00:36:05,325
updating it right yeah they keep calling

1021
00:36:05,325 --> 00:36:08,175
it back and those guys like long

1022
00:36:08,175 --> 00:36:09,976
stuff like it's like a long hour

1023
00:36:09,976 --> 00:36:11,715
of just us y'all shitting yeah

1024
00:36:11,745 --> 00:36:12,975
recently he was just stuff like lose

1025
00:36:12,975 --> 00:36:16,905
yourself and it's all eminem thinking based

1026
00:36:16,905 --> 00:36:18,495
but i think it's ninety percent emanating

1027
00:36:18,525 --> 00:36:19,905
and then then the real time our

1028
00:36:19,905 --> 00:36:22,755
team and stuff about imams and stuff

1029
00:36:22,755 --> 00:36:23,871
about him which is why our episode

1030
00:36:23,871 --> 00:36:25,395
will be up there yeah our taste

1031
00:36:25,395 --> 00:36:27,405
test episode that's right yeah it's on

1032
00:36:27,405 --> 00:36:30,075
theme is what gets done fleet they

1033
00:36:30,075 --> 00:36:31,636
need to be slightly out of the

1034
00:36:31,636 --> 00:36:31,905
flavor

1035
00:36:31,905 --> 00:36:33,285
ers are good so when they get

1036
00:36:33,285 --> 00:36:34,485
here they don't waste their time trying

1037
00:36:34,485 --> 00:36:36,585
every flavor if we if we have

1038
00:36:36,585 --> 00:36:37,965
done that as a service to the

1039
00:36:37,965 --> 00:36:39,225
aliens i'm proud do you think it

1040
00:36:39,225 --> 00:36:40,245
was a waste of our time to

1041
00:36:40,245 --> 00:36:42,495
try every flavor i enjoyed the best

1042
00:36:42,495 --> 00:36:44,085
use of time that we've ever had

1043
00:36:44,085 --> 00:36:46,035
to lately i feel like we need

1044
00:36:46,035 --> 00:36:47,355
to do more because there are a

1045
00:36:47,355 --> 00:36:48,825
lot more flavors you think can making

1046
00:36:48,825 --> 00:36:50,355
them yeah what was the flavor that

1047
00:36:50,535 --> 00:36:51,885
that we all texted each other and

1048
00:36:51,885 --> 00:36:52,035
we were

1049
00:36:52,065 --> 00:36:54,195
like whoa look at this from a

1050
00:36:54,195 --> 00:36:57,315
lot of christ yes was it kyle

1051
00:36:57,315 --> 00:36:59,085
dandy or something i don't remember i

1052
00:36:59,085 --> 00:37:00,555
don't remember but we should we should

1053
00:37:00,555 --> 00:37:03,225
definitely go seek that out yeah what

1054
00:37:03,225 --> 00:37:05,175
if we went to japan because they

1055
00:37:05,175 --> 00:37:07,515
have even more flavor over a house

1056
00:37:07,515 --> 00:37:08,888
together as a family do they do

1057
00:37:09,051 --> 00:37:10,475

1287
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:15,280
i would say in terms of like

1288
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:16,780
dangerous things that i did that had

1289
00:45:16,780 --> 00:45:19,720
no consequences they're all bike related me

1290
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:21,992

1291
00:45:22,510 --> 00:45:24,250
bike around the college where i went

1292
00:45:24,250 --> 00:45:25,990
to college for a couple of years

1293
00:45:25,990 --> 00:45:28,150
junior college and um there were these

1294
00:45:28,180 --> 00:45:32,170
ponds that we all like would jump

1295
00:45:32,170 --> 00:45:34,210
over the ponds with our bikes

1296
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:35,890
and i would always think like oh

1297
00:45:35,890 --> 00:45:37,060
i wonder what would happen to us

1298
00:45:37,060 --> 00:45:38,260
if we've and none of us ever

1299
00:45:38,260 --> 00:45:40,540

1300
00:45:40,540 --> 00:45:42,340
bike into the pool over brian hussein's

1301
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:43,587
house we would do that oh yeah

1302
00:45:43,587 --> 00:45:45,910
yeah where we would like the first

1303
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:47,800
time i did it i just rode

1304
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:49,210
right into the pool and the minute

1305
00:45:49,210 --> 00:45:51,160
the the front tire hit the water

1306
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:53,170
it flipped over and so i flipped

1307
00:45:53,170 --> 00:45:54,340
over on it but then i

1308
00:45:54,408 --> 00:45:55,570
like oh okay you have to like

1309
00:45:55,570 --> 00:45:57,430

1310
00:45:57,430 --> 00:45:59,605
fully just sink into the pool hey

1311
00:45:59,710 --> 00:46:00,580

1314
00:46:04,270 --> 00:46:06,790

00:46:06,790 --> 00:46:09,340
pool that's a nice job that's so

1316
00:46:09,340 --> 00:46:11,680

1359
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:36,640

00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:38,200
earth i guess you know on our

1361
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:41,170

1418
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:33,580
to think of i've had that conscious

1419
00:49:33,580 --> 00:49:35,680
thought of like i need to do

1420
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:37,900
something for inspiration here are the things

1421
00:49:37,990 --> 00:49:41,260
i've found work take a shower that's

1422
00:49:41,260 --> 00:49:42,610
like number one i was gonna set

1423
00:49:42,610 --> 00:49:45,340
to actual ah because you're just like

1424
00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:46,630
not think you're going

1425
00:49:46,690 --> 00:49:49,660
doing something else so mindwandering you ah

1426
00:49:49,690 --> 00:49:51,970
the the worst thing you can do

1427
00:49:52,540 --> 00:49:54,610
is sit there at your i mean

1428
00:49:54,610 --> 00:49:56,050
it's not you can still work it

1429
00:49:56,050 --> 00:49:57,310
out sometimes where you're like okay i'm

1430
00:49:57,310 --> 00:49:58,450
gonna grind this out in front of

1431
00:49:58,450 --> 00:50:01,750
my computer um yeah you can still

1432
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:04,360
you can still work that way but

1433
00:50:04,810 --> 00:50:06,820
i found it's better to approach

1434
00:50:06,850 --> 00:50:08,230
your computer when you already have it

1435
00:50:08,230 --> 00:50:09,220
in your head of what you're going

1436
00:50:09,220 --> 00:50:11,800
to do so the best thing to

1437
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:13,570
do when you're feeling just stuck is

1438
00:50:13,570 --> 00:50:15,730
to go take a shower and think

1439
00:50:15,730 --> 00:50:17,560
about it in the shower or go

1440
00:50:17,590 --> 00:50:19,000
take a walk outside i used to

1441
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,430
hike occasionally and by the time you

1442
00:50:21,430 --> 00:50:22,420
would get back from the hike you'd

1443
00:50:22,420 --> 00:50:23,800
have everything worked out in your head

1444
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:25,240
and then you just like type it

1445
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:26,140
up that's the thing this is like

1446
00:50:26,140 --> 00:50:27,010
a lot of people go like

1447
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:28,330
right to the computer and go like

1448
00:50:28,330 --> 00:50:30,280
ok now i'm working because they're trying

1449
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:31,840
to think of what to write yes

1450
00:50:31,870 --> 00:50:33,550
or whatever you gotta think of it

1451
00:50:33,550 --> 00:50:35,290
beforehand and then just get your computer

1452
00:50:35,290 --> 00:50:37,900
and like looking around my desk chair

1453
00:50:37,930 --> 00:50:40,780
a window yeah um i also feel

1454
00:50:40,780 --> 00:50:43,840
that i have a lot of ideas

1455
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:45,730
in bed when i'm yeah going to

1456
00:50:45,730 --> 00:50:47,080
bed to bed and i've

1457
00:50:47,170 --> 00:50:49,420
i've made myself get into the habit

1458
00:50:49,420 --> 00:50:51,100
of right like making a note of

1459
00:50:51,100 --> 00:50:52,930
things when anything i'm not talking about

1460
00:50:52,930 --> 00:50:55,060
like when you're falling asleep and you

1461
00:50:55,060 --> 00:50:56,465
think you have an interesting idea and

1462
00:50:56,465 --> 00:50:58,660
you down it's gibberish yeah right i'm

1463
00:50:58,660 --> 00:51:00,220
saying like when you're when you're still

1464
00:51:00,220 --> 00:51:01,570
awake and you're lying there in the

1465
00:51:01,570 --> 00:51:03,460
dark and your your mind starts going

1466
00:51:03,700 --> 00:51:05,200
what about this what about right things

1467
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:06,580

like if i'm in the middle of

1470
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:12,650

it at night because it's like one

1472
00:51:14,030 --> 00:51:15,890
of these problems it's it's a lot

like what they tell swirl problems it's

1474
00:51:19,010 --> 00:51:20,750
what they tell you about doing crosswords

1475
00:51:20,780 --> 00:51:22,040
is like set it down in your

1476
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:23,600
mind will continue to work on it

1477
00:51:23,660 --> 00:51:25,850
even though subconsciously even though you don't

1478
00:51:25,850 --> 00:51:27,590
know that you're working on and then

1479
00:51:27,590 --> 00:51:28,160
you pick it back

1480
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:29,240

but but um what was this oh

1488
00:51:44,870 --> 00:51:46,220
yeah when you're going to bed like

1489
00:51:46,220 --> 00:51:48,440
like it's and you and you're in

1490
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:49,310
the middle of a script and you

1491
00:51:49,310 --> 00:51:51,440
haven't quite figured out a plot point

1492
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:54,200
like i've found that like your mind

1493
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:56,570
continues to think about that until it's

1494
00:51:56,570 --> 00:51:59,090
worked itself out sometimes if you don't

1495
00:51:59,090 --> 00:52:00,920
do it before you're asleep sometimes it'll

1496
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:02,240
do it in a dream or

1497
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:03,195
do you think you'll have done it

1498
00:52:03,195 --> 00:52:04,640
a dream but yeah like going to

1499
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:06,560
bed is so if it's like ten

1500
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:07,400

1501
00:52:08,510 --> 00:52:10,430

00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:13,400
god me too for i am no

1504
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:16,100
my other thing is driving house music

1505
00:52:16,100 --> 00:52:17,720
i would say because i think i'm

1506
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:19,700
listening music i start to picture things

1507
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:20,630
and that kind of gets me like

1508
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:22,730
like note soils and this is this

1509
00:52:22,730 --> 00:52:25,940
is very simple but watch or listen

1510
00:52:25,940 --> 00:52:27,920
to things that you enjoy and think

1511
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:28,640
about why

1512
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:30,260
why you enjoy them think about what

1513
00:52:30,260 --> 00:52:32,180
it is that you like about that

1514
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:36,080
aspect of creativity and ah apply that

1515
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:37,760
to something that you want to do

1516
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:39,530
you know what i mean like because

1517
00:52:39,530 --> 00:52:42,710
sometimes i will i will find i'll

1518
00:52:42,710 --> 00:52:44,810
enjoy something that has nothing to do

1519
00:52:44,810 --> 00:52:45,920
with a thing that i want to

1520
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:48,800
do but i look at the approach

1521
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:50,780
each of it and say oh i

1522
00:52:50,780 --> 00:52:52,310
can apply that to my thing even

1523
00:52:52,310 --> 00:52:54,140
though it's completely different from this thing

1524
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:56,270
but i the more you think about

1525
00:52:56,690 --> 00:52:58,010
how they do the things that they

1526
00:52:58,010 --> 00:52:59,480
do why you enjoy it what is

1527
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:02,330
satisfying or enjoyable about it um you

1528
00:53:02,330 --> 00:53:04,160
can get lessons there that's why your

1529
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:05,630

went on for such a long time

1585
00:55:18,620 --> 00:55:20,570
and it was so satisfying that's it

1586
00:55:20,570 --> 00:55:22,550
was so i was trying so hard

1587
00:55:22,550 --> 00:55:25,040
not to laugh and i it just

1588
00:55:25,070 --> 00:55:27,230

i wish i had recorded this yeah

1591
00:55:30,710 --> 00:55:31,760
because it was like

1592
00:55:32,180 --> 00:55:33,110
it was like one of those things

1593
00:55:33,110 --> 00:55:35,150
where people were laughing in waves yeah

1594
00:55:35,150 --> 00:55:36,920
i mean they couldn't believe that we

1595
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:39,560
did it we couldn't believe that and

1596
00:55:39,620 --> 00:55:41,330
it but it could only have happened

1597
00:55:41,390 --> 00:55:43,670
that day yeah you should know you

1598
00:55:43,670 --> 00:55:44,960

why it works so well you did

1600
00:55:47,330 --> 00:55:48,560
say we've done this at every show

1601
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:50,360
this is the first time it's really

1602
00:55:52,190 --> 00:55:54,200

1603
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:57,020

i guess my thing equivalent to that

1607
00:56:04,580 --> 00:56:05,960
is like i was training to get

1608
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:07,070
fit when the toilet

1609
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:09,350
what happened to you

1610
00:56:10,592 --> 00:56:12,590
it went away this year trying to

1611
00:56:12,650 --> 00:56:14,540

1612
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:15,320

to ah sometimes talking is a lot

1618
00:56:30,110 --> 00:56:32,210
shinobi we should just do the show

1619
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:33,920
not as a show and where we

1620
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:35,840
don't talk oh okay so we just

1621
00:56:35,930 --> 00:56:38,780
skyland scenario and silently yes yeah we

1622
00:56:38,780 --> 00:56:39,320
don't record it

1623
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:41,300
it has to be what does we'll

1624
00:56:41,300 --> 00:56:42,530

1625
00:56:42,590 --> 00:56:44,810
our own house zoom yeah yeah and

1626
00:56:44,810 --> 00:56:46,010
we turn off the zoom yeah we

1627
00:56:46,010 --> 00:56:48,230
turn on your computer and we just

1628
00:56:48,230 --> 00:56:49,520
do it in our own houses and

1629
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:51,080
we'd never see each other again yeah

1630
00:56:51,756 --> 00:56:54,022
sounds good to me people often think

1631
00:56:54,022 --> 00:56:56,420
like it sounds like like lauren wants

1632
00:56:56,420 --> 00:56:57,800
the show to end there's i've seen

1633
00:56:57,800 --> 00:57:00,080
comments like that and which always use

1634
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:00,500
specific

1635
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:01,820
or like us or like i don't

1636
00:57:01,820 --> 00:57:03,027
know i've seen comments where it's like

1637
00:57:03,027 --> 00:57:04,160
i'm saying sounds like they're getting tired

1638
00:57:04,190 --> 00:57:06,025
now that's not how we feel it's

1639
00:57:06,025 --> 00:57:07,310
one of that like oh life is

1640
00:57:07,310 --> 00:57:10,100
busy and sometimes it's hard so it's

1641
00:57:10,100 --> 00:57:12,050
also you you have another thing you

1642
00:57:12,050 --> 00:57:14,270
