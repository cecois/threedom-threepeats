was the firstborn so he was the

298
00:11:19,495 --> 00:11:21,925
the junior and then it was expected

299
00:11:21,925 --> 00:11:23,815
that when my parents had a son

300
00:11:23,845 --> 00:11:25,322
that the firstborn would be a junior

301
00:11:25,322 --> 00:11:25,585

00:31:17,425 --> 00:31:18,656
if he's magic wanting to make himself

863
00:31:18,656 --> 00:31:21,655
heavier wow it's not magic is mentalism

864
00:31:21,775 --> 00:31:24,325

865
00:31:24,355 --> 00:31:26,605

00:36:48,415 --> 00:36:49,495
with like a bar that goes down

1038
00:36:49,495 --> 00:36:50,605

and she's tiny

1041
00:36:55,645 --> 00:36:57,955
the cars immediately separate and start going

1042
00:36:57,955 --> 00:36:59,845
in different directions so mike and i

1043
00:36:59,845 --> 00:37:01,015
are looking into like oh my god

1044
00:37:01,255 --> 00:37:05,455
everything is blaring loud bright screens loudest

1045
00:37:05,455 --> 00:37:08,095
sounds in the world we squish together

1046
00:37:08,095 --> 00:37:09,835
to like hold her tightly in place

1047
00:37:10,225 --> 00:37:11,815
the car is going all over the

1048
00:37:11,845 --> 00:37:14,035
place it's crazy we were like panicking

1049
00:37:14,035 --> 00:37:14,965
we're looking into like oh my god

1050
00:37:14,965 --> 00:37:15,205

1051
00:37:16,015 --> 00:37:18,175
and then like there's a glaring sounds

1052
00:37:18,175 --> 00:37:19,735
it was kind of scary feeling to

1053
00:37:19,735 --> 00:37:20,875
me i couldn't even pay attention to

1054
00:37:20,875 --> 00:37:21,805
what the ride was because i was

1055
00:37:21,805 --> 00:37:23,545
looking at her covered her eyes lot

1056
00:37:23,935 --> 00:37:24,775
then like you go in the other

1057
00:37:24,775 --> 00:37:26,635
room and it's calming down and you're

1058
00:37:26,635 --> 00:37:28,195
in front of like clara the cow

1059
00:37:28,225 --> 00:37:29,815
dentist comes out but basically you're in

1060
00:37:29,815 --> 00:37:31,585
front of clara the cow who's like

1061
00:37:31,585 --> 00:37:33,325
that old timey thing right and you're

1062
00:37:33,325 --> 00:37:35,035
looking at a mirror at all patrician

1063
00:37:35,035 --> 00:37:35,365
appreciate

1064
00:37:35,365 --> 00:37:36,985
it being described that way and all

1065
00:37:36,985 --> 00:37:39,055
the cars turn and face the mirror

1066
00:37:39,055 --> 00:37:40,165
and they're going really slowly like she's

1067
00:37:40,165 --> 00:37:41,755
like one two three one two thick

1068
00:37:41,935 --> 00:37:44,335
coating ballet that's good that's okay it's

1069
00:37:44,335 --> 00:37:45,715
looking a little creepy but it's okay

1070
00:37:45,925 --> 00:37:48,025
and then she goes let's conca and

1071
00:37:48,025 --> 00:37:50,305
the the fuckin benches start like the

1072
00:37:50,335 --> 00:37:52,315
drawers are going crazy around the room

1073
00:37:52,315 --> 00:37:54,805
come on how he's like yeah and

1074
00:37:54,805 --> 00:37:55,525
we were freaking out

1075
00:37:55,555 --> 00:37:56,485
we often were like oh my god

1076
00:37:56,485 --> 00:37:58,615
it's overthink god and then it's the

1077
00:37:58,645 --> 00:37:59,695
only thing she can talk about she's

1078
00:37:59,695 --> 00:38:01,405
been talking about the social luck and

1079
00:38:01,405 --> 00:38:04,975
a half she's like train movie smoke

1080
00:38:05,155 --> 00:38:07,465
hole like she does is like every

1081
00:38:07,465 --> 00:38:10,015
word so this is my theory she's

1082
00:38:10,015 --> 00:38:12,295
obsessed same thing happened with when we

1083
00:38:12,295 --> 00:38:13,585
took our nephew when he was younger

1084
00:38:13,585 --> 00:38:14,635
and we took took him on the

1085
00:38:14,635 --> 00:38:15,685
goofy ride yeah

1086
00:38:15,685 --> 00:38:17,065
yeah and i'd read that was fine

1087
00:38:17,065 --> 00:38:20,215
for his age and it's it's basically

1088
00:38:20,215 --> 00:38:21,535
a roller coaster where your legs are

1089
00:38:21,535 --> 00:38:25,043
dangling that's pretty goofy and ah seemed

1090
00:38:25,043 --> 00:38:26,845
scary when right on right as it

1091
00:38:26,845 --> 00:38:28,225
started going he goes i want to

1092
00:38:28,225 --> 00:38:30,655
get off this is scary and yeah

1093
00:38:30,865 --> 00:38:32,185
and i was like we can't now

1094
00:38:32,185 --> 00:38:34,585
and i was yeah can you share

1095
00:38:34,615 --> 00:38:35,778
yeah twenty eight years

1096
00:38:35,845 --> 00:38:37,282
old in it and it was scaring

1097
00:38:37,282 --> 00:38:39,445
me and so we we get off

1098
00:38:39,445 --> 00:38:40,735
and he was like oh that was

1099
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:43,765
bad and then about thirty seconds later

1100
00:38:43,765 --> 00:38:45,265
he was like i think we could

1101
00:38:45,265 --> 00:38:47,065
do it again yes like they like

1102
00:38:47,065 --> 00:38:48,895
being scared i think she really liked

1103
00:38:48,895 --> 00:38:50,185
it it was just so funny and

1104
00:38:50,185 --> 00:38:51,685

steel pier whatever atlantic city ah where

1151
00:40:19,525 --> 00:40:20,965

of the country just like a mexican

1158
00:40:32,505 --> 00:40:33,975
place or something yeah yeah but they

1159
00:40:34,005 --> 00:40:35,265
it was this place that they would

1160
00:40:35,265 --> 00:40:38,085
all go to as kids um that

1161
00:40:38,085 --> 00:40:39,105
way because it has like crazy like

1162
00:40:39,105 --> 00:40:41,325
grottos are like weird yeah yeah fine

1163
00:40:41,325 --> 00:40:43,455
but but they were talking about this

1164
00:40:43,485 --> 00:40:45,435
this room where basically like when they

1165
00:40:45,435 --> 00:40:46,605
were growing up as kids

1166
00:40:46,815 --> 00:40:48,165
they bought the place and the people

1167
00:40:48,165 --> 00:40:49,395
came to inspect it and it was

1168
00:40:49,395 --> 00:40:52,635
these divers would dive into a very

1169
00:40:52,635 --> 00:40:54,315
shallow pool and the only way to

1170
00:40:54,315 --> 00:40:55,875
get out of it was swimming through

1171
00:40:55,875 --> 00:40:58,455
like a hole oh god and the

1172
00:40:58,455 --> 00:41:00,405
people and then there were elect electrical

1173
00:41:00,405 --> 00:41:02,865
equipment everywhere out of it yeah like

1174
00:41:02,865 --> 00:41:05,055
you could but for the show right

1175
00:41:05,085 --> 00:41:06,825
essentially you had you couldn't just pop

1176
00:41:06,825 --> 00:41:06,945
your

1177
00:41:06,975 --> 00:41:09,285
head up oh i would you had

1178
00:41:09,285 --> 00:41:11,475
to switch do that i do but

1179
00:41:11,475 --> 00:41:13,125
the way it was they were expecting

1180
00:41:13,125 --> 00:41:14,745
it and they and the inspectors were

1181
00:41:14,745 --> 00:41:16,365
like this is the most dangerous room

1182
00:41:16,365 --> 00:41:17,385
i've ever seen wow

1183
00:41:18,225 --> 00:41:19,725
um so they retro you know they

1184
00:41:19,755 --> 00:41:21,765
they retrofitted it to make it safe

1185
00:41:21,915 --> 00:41:24,495
like more libertarian yeah but ah no

1186
00:41:24,495 --> 00:41:25,725
it sounds really cool i would love

1187
00:41:25,725 --> 00:41:27,315
to go to it yeah whereas i

1188
00:41:27,315 --> 00:41:29,055
think it's the middle of the country

1189
00:41:29,055 --> 00:41:31,215
i'm gonna look this real america

1190
00:41:35,385 --> 00:41:39,435

takes place of course

1195
00:41:52,575 --> 00:41:53,895
of course it all makes sense where

1196
00:41:53,904 --> 00:41:57,765
kenny died yeah somebody killed kenny

1197
00:41:58,515 --> 00:42:01,485
somebody who did those bastards yeah

1198
00:42:03,465 --> 00:42:05,085

1199
00:42:05,085 --> 00:42:07,515
on broadway oh my god um so

1200
00:42:07,515 --> 00:42:08,595

00:42:31,575 --> 00:42:33,975

you

1223
00:43:01,065 --> 00:43:04,695
last night we watched on television asteroid

1224
00:43:04,695 --> 00:43:08,025
city the west yes and oh yeah

1225
00:43:08,025 --> 00:43:10,215
i enjoyed it i feel like

1226
00:43:11,295 --> 00:43:13,485
ah he is he has settled into

1227
00:43:13,485 --> 00:43:15,975
a certain style of thing like a

1228
00:43:16,005 --> 00:43:18,015
almost a wes anderson style well but

1229
00:43:18,015 --> 00:43:20,085
i mean it used to be it's

1230
00:43:20,115 --> 00:43:24,015
it's cemented now it's not as people

1231
00:43:24,075 --> 00:43:25,695
like the performances are all kind of

1232
00:43:25,695 --> 00:43:28,185
uniform now um in a way that

1233
00:43:28,185 --> 00:43:29,385
they didn't use to be like yeah

1234
00:43:29,595 --> 00:43:31,425
like if you watched rushmore like bill

1235
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:34,635
murray is doing a very interesting thing

1236
00:43:34,695 --> 00:43:37,065
yeah and really like schwarzman is doing

1237
00:43:37,155 --> 00:43:38,895
the most wes anderson he type stuff

1238
00:43:38,955 --> 00:43:40,665
everyone else is kind of lying and

1239
00:43:40,665 --> 00:43:43,965
now everyone's quiet nobody speaks above a

1240
00:43:43,995 --> 00:43:46,905
normal conversational tone you know i mean

1241
00:43:46,905 --> 00:43:50,235
no there's hardly any inflection but it's

1242
00:43:50,325 --> 00:43:51,555
you know there's a lot the

1243
00:43:51,585 --> 00:43:53,115
only one i really have not enjoyed

1244
00:43:53,115 --> 00:43:54,105
all the way through is the french

1245
00:43:54,135 --> 00:43:56,025
dispatch but other than that i never

1246
00:43:56,025 --> 00:43:58,272
saw that there like enjoyable you know

1247
00:43:58,279 --> 00:43:59,745
i mean it's like it looks it

1248
00:43:59,745 --> 00:44:01,065
always looks great it's fun to watch

1249
00:44:01,065 --> 00:44:02,835
something the auto beautiful yeah yeah and

1250
00:44:02,835 --> 00:44:04,155
there's an honest course there's always a

1251
00:44:04,155 --> 00:44:05,895
lot of funny moments and yeah the

1252
00:44:06,045 --> 00:44:07,215
you know people that you like to

1253
00:44:07,215 --> 00:44:08,205
see whenever anyway

1254
00:44:09,015 --> 00:44:11,796
in this movie these kids are playing

1255
00:44:11,805 --> 00:44:13,785
a game that i think is similar

1256
00:44:13,785 --> 00:44:16,305
to a thing we've done before but

1257
00:44:16,305 --> 00:44:18,285
you had to do was that hopscotch

1258
00:44:18,645 --> 00:44:20,055
yes i do that that's how you

1259
00:44:20,055 --> 00:44:22,035
make game people hated that when we

1260
00:44:22,035 --> 00:44:23,745
played it on the show i know

1261
00:44:23,925 --> 00:44:25,095
that's why i'm shipping closer to the

1262
00:44:25,095 --> 00:44:27,105
mix yeah i guess and your pebbles

1263
00:44:27,435 --> 00:44:29,025

1264
00:44:29,025 --> 00:44:30,195
as my fruity pebble yeah

1265
00:44:31,455 --> 00:44:32,355
if we do pebbles bit

1266
00:44:33,585 --> 00:44:34,605
it's nothing

1267
00:44:35,805 --> 00:44:37,515

00:45:14,415 --> 00:45:15,885
vampire slayer which i didn't really get

1286
00:45:15,885 --> 00:45:16,005
into

1287
00:45:16,065 --> 00:45:16,695
that show

1288
00:45:17,835 --> 00:45:19,326
you know because you're a vampire you

1289
00:45:19,335 --> 00:45:20,805
are afraid like oh i couldn't watch

1290
00:45:20,805 --> 00:45:21,645
it because it would keep me up

1291
00:45:21,855 --> 00:45:24,675
yeah i didn't make any tv show

1292
00:45:24,705 --> 00:45:25,965
keeping you up if you watch ou

1293
00:45:28,875 --> 00:45:31,695
i was hanging in my casket um

1294
00:45:31,755 --> 00:45:33,465
you know i've realised when i if

1295
00:45:33,518 --> 00:45:35,055
i think i'm going to be cremated

1296
00:45:35,175 --> 00:45:37,425
okay oh cool sometimes funding by me

1297
00:45:37,965 --> 00:45:39,345
probably that's what i took that's a

1298
00:45:39,345 --> 00:45:42,345
battle which was like okay um we're

1299
00:45:42,345 --> 00:45:44,055
gonna pulverize you but if i were

1300
00:45:44,055 --> 00:45:45,705
to be buried i definitely want one

1301
00:45:45,705 --> 00:45:46,905
of those old-fashioned

1302
00:45:47,445 --> 00:45:50,655
like hyphens oh ah what well where

1303
00:45:50,655 --> 00:45:51,915
it's got the top that looks like

1304
00:45:51,915 --> 00:45:54,645
crip crip site yeah you want grips

1305
00:45:54,645 --> 00:45:57,345
to i want grips the grip to

1306
00:45:57,345 --> 00:45:59,205
somebody representing the six things i've worked

1307
00:45:59,205 --> 00:46:00,645
on over the course like

1308
00:46:03,075 --> 00:46:04,695
but you know those like the like

1309
00:46:04,785 --> 00:46:07,695
ah wild west yeah where that's going

1310
00:46:07,695 --> 00:46:10,335
nowhere it's like a hexagon yeah yeah

1311
00:46:10,365 --> 00:46:12,045
that's what i want yeah that april

1312
00:46:12,045 --> 00:46:13,875
in there i of course there's people

1313
00:46:13,875 --> 00:46:15,255
i think here's what i think i

1314
00:46:15,255 --> 00:46:17,775
think you're allowed to do that i

1315
00:46:17,775 --> 00:46:18,945
think what's going to have to happen

1316
00:46:18,945 --> 00:46:21,465
with with caskets and burials at discernment

1317
00:46:21,465 --> 00:46:21,825
wouldn't be bear

1318
00:46:21,825 --> 00:46:23,115
worried straight down i think you should

1319
00:46:23,115 --> 00:46:24,825
be standing and i think yeah they

1320
00:46:24,885 --> 00:46:27,675
should be horner's should be vertical because

1321
00:46:27,975 --> 00:46:29,535
because so many space running out of

1322
00:46:29,535 --> 00:46:31,005
space but no idea here's what i

1323
00:46:31,005 --> 00:46:32,205
mean and it makes the most sense

1324
00:46:32,235 --> 00:46:33,675
here's what sucks is that if we

1325
00:46:33,675 --> 00:46:35,325
are buried that way then when somebody

1326
00:46:35,325 --> 00:46:37,635
digs up your coffin all your bones

1327
00:46:37,635 --> 00:46:38,685
are gonna be in a pile down

1328
00:46:38,685 --> 00:46:40,215
to bottom as your clothes are just

1329
00:46:40,215 --> 00:46:41,526
going to be kind of pilot gravity

1330
00:46:41,706 --> 00:46:41,985
cool

1331
00:46:41,985 --> 00:46:43,785
a remedy still exists yes when you

1332
00:46:43,815 --> 00:46:45,703
open a coffin you want to see

1333
00:46:45,765 --> 00:46:48,765
skeleton skeleton laying there like bone tattered

1334
00:46:48,765 --> 00:46:50,505
clothes because the school would be on

1335
00:46:50,505 --> 00:46:52,395
top the feet bones beyond the bottom

1336
00:46:52,395 --> 00:46:53,175
that's how it's going to be on

1337
00:46:53,175 --> 00:46:54,345
top the people to be on the

1338
00:46:54,345 --> 00:46:57,075
bottom when people are exude for like

1339
00:46:57,105 --> 00:46:59,325
research or something or like for evidence

1340
00:46:59,325 --> 00:47:02,085
one yeah are the are we

1341
00:47:02,145 --> 00:47:04,335
looking at bones is always like we

1342
00:47:04,395 --> 00:47:06,345
look how long it takes her like

1343
00:47:06,705 --> 00:47:08,295
like a body to become three days

1344
00:47:08,805 --> 00:47:11,565
that's it in the in the shutout

1345
00:47:12,105 --> 00:47:14,235
well on yellowstone when rip had his

1346
00:47:14,235 --> 00:47:16,815
mother zoomed she was still kind of

1347
00:47:16,815 --> 00:47:18,495
had some skin cleaning tour when he

1348
00:47:18,495 --> 00:47:20,955
went to get her ah engagement ring

1349
00:47:21,345 --> 00:47:22,185
i think it takes a couple of

1350
00:47:22,185 --> 00:47:22,305
years

1351
00:47:22,305 --> 00:47:23,235
yeah but i'll look it up let's

1352
00:47:23,235 --> 00:47:25,305
see what's in the casket i assume

1353
00:47:25,307 --> 00:47:26,535
that takes on email so i also

1354
00:47:26,535 --> 00:47:27,765
want to throw up talking about this

1355
00:47:27,765 --> 00:47:29,445
to decompose kind of hit me in

1356
00:47:29,445 --> 00:47:32,955
a different way to see if insects

1357
00:47:32,955 --> 00:47:35,745
can be excluded a body will decompose

1358
00:47:35,745 --> 00:47:37,605
quite slowly because maggots are the most

1359
00:47:37,605 --> 00:47:40,035
voracious crash feeders yes that's why we

1360
00:47:40,035 --> 00:47:42,465
must exclude insects although unexposed

1361
00:47:42,495 --> 00:47:44,445
human body in optimum conditions can be

1362
00:47:44,445 --> 00:47:46,875
reduced to bone in ten days a

1363
00:47:46,875 --> 00:47:48,855
body that's our optimum conditions for an

1364
00:47:48,855 --> 00:47:51,495
exposed human body like sort of castaways

1365
00:47:51,495 --> 00:47:54,825
seen like sun tea a body they

1366
00:47:54,825 --> 00:47:56,535
there i go yeah a body this

1367
00:47:56,535 --> 00:47:58,035
buried one point two meters under the

1368
00:47:58,035 --> 00:47:59,835
ground retains most of it's tissue for

1369
00:47:59,835 --> 00:48:00,525
a year

1370
00:48:02,085 --> 00:48:04,155
so that's so crazy out in your

1371
00:48:04,155 --> 00:48:05,865
casket and smoke that's so three weeks

1372
00:48:05,865 --> 00:48:08,385
to several years for to completely nose

1373
00:48:08,385 --> 00:48:09,705
into a skill i guess i'll say

1374
00:48:09,705 --> 00:48:11,085
i would like to be cremated but

1375
00:48:11,085 --> 00:48:12,195
i would like you to be you

1376
00:48:12,195 --> 00:48:14,955
know would like to be a plaque

1377
00:48:14,955 --> 00:48:18,465
or headstone tombstone of some sort even

1378
00:48:18,465 --> 00:48:20,325
if i'm not having my data there

1379
00:48:20,385 --> 00:48:21,675
as my dad did he got cremated

1380
00:48:21,675 --> 00:48:21,825
and the

1381
00:48:21,855 --> 00:48:23,175
we put that fucking bowl in the

1382
00:48:23,175 --> 00:48:25,245
ground yeah what about an nfc

1383
00:48:26,535 --> 00:48:28,605
if if my like what's it called

1384
00:48:29,085 --> 00:48:31,425
gravestone nice fun trip said like how

1385
00:48:31,425 --> 00:48:32,415
like a tv screen and there was

1386
00:48:32,415 --> 00:48:33,915
like a moving image oh yea yeah

1387
00:48:33,945 --> 00:48:35,235
yeah that'd be great yeah but be

1388
00:48:35,235 --> 00:48:37,095
cool let me great who would change

1389
00:48:37,095 --> 00:48:40,425
the batteries the grave shift people you

1390
00:48:40,425 --> 00:48:41,565
know here's the thing that i've become

1391
00:48:41,565 --> 00:48:43,035
like the people i work the graveyard

1392
00:48:43,305 --> 00:48:44,203
i've had a career

1393
00:48:46,065 --> 00:48:48,645
i've become obsessed with this idea with

1394
00:48:48,645 --> 00:48:50,805
various things i would like to be

1395
00:48:50,805 --> 00:48:53,115
put in an urn or something because

1396
00:48:53,145 --> 00:48:55,725
i like the idea that eventually that's

1397
00:48:55,725 --> 00:48:57,525
going to pass into somebody else's hands

1398
00:48:57,555 --> 00:48:59,025
will have no fucking idea who i

1399
00:48:59,025 --> 00:49:00,915
am yeah but no it will make

1400
00:49:00,915 --> 00:49:03,045
them look you up and listen to

1401
00:49:03,045 --> 00:49:05,025
all your podcasts or not they'll just

1402
00:49:05,025 --> 00:49:05,505
be like i

1403
00:49:05,535 --> 00:49:07,275
i got this this this thing this

1404
00:49:07,275 --> 00:49:10,455
thing yeah they hope he interested at

1405
00:49:10,455 --> 00:49:11,505
all wait so but it makes me

1406
00:49:11,535 --> 00:49:14,085
laugh they play an asteroid city okay

1407
00:49:15,975 --> 00:49:17,265
you you have i think when you're

1408
00:49:17,265 --> 00:49:18,675
buried by the way you should do

1409
00:49:19,425 --> 00:49:21,045
whatever you want and it should be

1410
00:49:21,075 --> 00:49:22,605
when you want it should be legal

1411
00:49:22,605 --> 00:49:24,135
whatever you want done with your body

1412
00:49:24,435 --> 00:49:25,845
is legal because what are they gonna

1413
00:49:25,845 --> 00:49:27,855
do like prosecute you know you're dead

1414
00:49:27,975 --> 00:49:28,785
what if you want to dump in

1415
00:49:28,785 --> 00:49:31,455
a public pool great that that's ruined

1416
00:49:31,485 --> 00:49:33,585
the day for the people well so

1417
00:49:34,515 --> 00:49:35,265
you know fight me

1418
00:49:35,339 --> 00:49:36,537
you think it would be something and

1419
00:49:36,537 --> 00:49:37,935
i think you should leave i think

1420
00:49:37,935 --> 00:49:40,065
it might be a crime for who

1421
00:49:40,065 --> 00:49:42,255
though you're dead well i mean you

1422
00:49:42,255 --> 00:49:44,385
can't be prosecuted but whoever you instructed

1423
00:49:44,415 --> 00:49:48,795
way like that bernie style paul into

1424
00:49:48,795 --> 00:49:50,295
the pool and just like you will

1425
00:49:50,295 --> 00:49:51,885
be the louche yeah oh not peppery

1426
00:49:53,115 --> 00:49:56,685
ah have anyone make that yeah this

1427
00:49:57,075 --> 00:49:58,035
will be one percent of the pool

1428
00:49:58,635 --> 00:50:00,495
if it's just shaking like bernie's being

1429
00:50:00,495 --> 00:50:02,775
held up by joe biden and trump

1430
00:50:03,135 --> 00:50:05,115
and it's burning in the middle but

1431
00:50:05,115 --> 00:50:07,575
in the like moderation are you getting

1432
00:50:07,575 --> 00:50:09,195
the hat i don't know if you're

1433
00:50:09,195 --> 00:50:12,045
funny best friends yeah they spend so

1434
00:50:12,045 --> 00:50:13,155
much time on the campaign trail

1435
00:50:13,185 --> 00:50:16,215
together um okay so in this in

1436
00:50:16,215 --> 00:50:17,415
the movie they play this game these

1437
00:50:17,415 --> 00:50:19,365
kids play this game where you name

1438
00:50:19,515 --> 00:50:21,195
somebody starts to name a famous person

1439
00:50:21,825 --> 00:50:23,835
um and then you go around the

1440
00:50:23,835 --> 00:50:25,605
circle and everyone has to keep adding

1441
00:50:25,785 --> 00:50:27,825
a name that everyone has to repeat

1442
00:50:27,825 --> 00:50:28,995
the names that have been saying yeah

1443
00:50:29,145 --> 00:50:29,985
and add a name now i think

1444
00:50:29,985 --> 00:50:31,095
we played a game like it's like

1445
00:50:31,095 --> 00:50:33,315
a memory thing yes exactly exactly

1446
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,350
and trip and i'm taking my this

1447
00:50:35,380 --> 00:50:36,610
am i this i might dismiss your

1448
00:50:36,610 --> 00:50:38,020
name every yeah yeah everyone's been saying

1449
00:50:38,020 --> 00:50:39,940
okay yeah yeah okay so it's a

1450
00:50:39,940 --> 00:50:41,560
simple game we can play okay i

1451
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:43,060
would like we can decide maybe we

1452
00:50:43,060 --> 00:50:44,830
can have categories like if you want

1453
00:50:44,830 --> 00:50:47,230
to do characters than you you just

1454
00:50:47,230 --> 00:50:49,000
stick to that can we do it

1455
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,220
where each name has to be start

1456
00:50:51,220 --> 00:50:54,130
with a letter that easier like alphabetical

1457
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:57,490
alphabetical order you're not talking about the

1458
00:50:57,490 --> 00:51:00,280
sounds dangerously close to celebrity hunt oh

1459
00:51:00,310 --> 00:51:00,610
maybe

1460
00:51:02,230 --> 00:51:03,070
i love supplies

1461
00:51:04,457 --> 00:51:07,420
yeah let's play asteroids note i think

1462
00:51:07,712 --> 00:51:09,250
it's harder when it's random like zoo

1463
00:51:09,251 --> 00:51:10,420
random let's just see how we get

1464
