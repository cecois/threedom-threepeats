00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:07,290
like a little set like little pieces

21
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:08,850

so famous in halloween skeletons are everywhere

00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:22,560
like

53
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,960
like little ah you know like rivets

54
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,420

00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:29,618
are they called you know on a

56
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,280
cardboard skeleton decorate oh yeah like that

57
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,890
has the rat join brad's yeah right

58
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:37,050
but they're not really brown gold circle

59
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,910
like the absence of brad yeah yeah

60
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:40,890
yeah zo brad yeah but if you

61
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:42,660
saw literally

62
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,010
the bones that would be in a

63
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:45,600
human being you're not dressing it up

64
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,370
or making it scarier whatever they just

65
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:49,410
walking around your house it would be

66
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:51,180
scary movie scary you don't need to

67
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,830
dress up a skirt we don't dress

68
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:54,300
up skeletons we don't need to put

69
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,700
them in top hats no we don't

70
00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:00,480
need guys who it's fun to to

71
00:03:00,485 --> 00:03:02,880
do it first amendment potatoes the kiehl's

72
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:05,910
skeleton yeah yes you know you've made

73
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:07,080
it when you've been asked to sign

74
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:10,050
the keel skeleton we don't we don't

75
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:11,790
talk enough about the kills can we

76
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:13,980
tone and we need to because honestly

77
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:15,390
when you think about it is that

78
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:17,700
their mascot they do all skin or

79
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,410
something that is the absence of skin

80
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:21,720
itself right so if you use our

81
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:22,889
stuff long enough this is what you'll

82
00:03:22,889 --> 00:03:23,040
end up

83
00:03:23,205 --> 00:03:25,774
you scrub your skin too much there's

84
00:03:25,774 --> 00:03:27,900
no model that they use i don't

85
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,210
think who has the best skin in

86
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,160
the world i mean you can't can't

87
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:33,780
quite who has the best skeleton in

88
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:36,000
the world me i know think so

89
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:37,440
i know i have a good skeleton

90
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,600
strip away everything yeah and your skeleton

91
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:43,050
is really really tricky yes all were

92
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:43,200
so

93
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,540
skeletons like log in one hundred years

94
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:47,790
when we're dead and we're skeletons and

95
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:49,260
they pulled up all three of our

96
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:50,970
skeletons anyone could be able to go

97
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:53,460
that's lauren that's scott and that's probably

98
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:54,990
from how tall we are probably we

99
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:57,450
gave out our heights we did give

100
00:03:57,450 --> 00:03:58,530
them and i mean i never should

101
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:00,540
have done that i'm also not male

102
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:01,800
and i think that that should look

103
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,360
different because you wouldn't have a penis

104
00:04:03,426 --> 00:04:03,720
bone

105
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:07,495
so yeah you direction but yeah when

106
00:04:07,495 --> 00:04:09,210
i was thinking that's probably my team

107
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:10,590
six feet out

108
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:14,130
that's how that's why they need caskets

109
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:16,650
because otherwise exactly i mean breaking through

110
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:18,660
the ground adds why we need casco

111
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:19,980
yeah yeah yeah it took them a

112
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:21,210
long time to figure that out right

113
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,830
what if you saw in your house

114
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,140
and it's let's say somebody you knew

115
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:26,490
and they called you said hey i'm

116
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:29,160
gonna come over there is something different

117
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,000
about me and i want you to

118
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,080
be freaked out when you see it

119
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:31,680
okay

120
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,060
but they don't say what it is

121
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:34,170
they don't say well god i would

122
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:35,790

123
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,550

away from your own home no i

129
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,360
thought they want me to come over

130
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,580
and snuggle i'm coming over okay something

131
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:50,100

want you to be freaked out but

133
00:04:51,153 --> 00:04:52,260
then i'd be like we're just getting

134
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:54,150
you shouldn't have you should just be

135
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:55,560
you should be outside i can't wait

136
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,880
any longer what is it i am

137
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,120
outside

138
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,230
good action i'm calling good and thank

139
00:04:58,230 --> 00:04:59,700
god yes alright i'm coming yeah what

140
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,860
is it and then they come in

141
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:05,280
and their head is just a skull

142
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,560
now like the rest of their bodies

143
00:05:07,778 --> 00:05:09,570
yeah that's fine but it's just a

144
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:10,890
skull they can talk where does the

145
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:13,440
skin they have hair no no hair

146
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,198
skin start under the jaw line or

147
00:05:15,198 --> 00:05:17,156
or under the neckline under the neckline

148
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:17,280
so

149
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:18,960
if you're if they're wearing a polo

150
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,630
shirt yes would you see any skin

151
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:23,550
they were i would say they would

152
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:25,140
probably try to make it so that

153
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:26,220
you couldn't see the skin if you

154
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:28,830
were michael caine waiting on ripping open

155
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:30,420
like a tennis jacket i'm just like

156
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:31,770
pulling it down when you get down

157
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:34,140
to chef service you'd see some of

158
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:35,910
that skin yeah you'd probably see some

159
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:37,410
of the skin i can't i can't

160
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,350
tell you exactly where the skin joins

161
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,330
it probably doesn't look great i'll be

162
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:45,090
honest is it does it meld in

163
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:47,550
like like gradually like an ombre hey

164
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:50,370
man i don't know i think i

165
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:52,170
think what my friend did and just

166
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,310
feel like you should know this and

167
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:55,800
your friend is trying to shield you

168
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,910
from that and they're wearing a turtle

169
00:05:56,910 --> 00:05:57,270
neck

170
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,646
owning my little boy yeah jack is

171
00:05:59,646 --> 00:06:01,473
sticking up on this and the skull

172
00:06:01,473 --> 00:06:03,330
atop my first reaction is i'm not

173
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:05,310
opening the door to that i might

174
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:06,750
be looking through the window going what's

175
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,010
going on what have you might be

176
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:09,570
saying like hey take off your mask

177
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:10,800
and let me show me the real

178
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,940
thing was i can tell us on

179
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:13,980
a map because it's smaller than what

180
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:15,630
they want a lot of noise these

181
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:17,340
fake phone calls were there using real

182
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:17,670
people's

183
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:20,490
voices spoofs but if they're called spoofs

184
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:22,110
i think they're called up i think

185
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:23,970
if you had like a an unusual

186
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:25,860
like sudden birthmark syndrome

187
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:28,170
um and you said hey like there's

188
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:29,700
something weird about my face or like

189
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,290
remember when carrie underwood just kind of

190
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:32,970
said that's all of her fans nothing

191
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:34,620
was different right i mean she's still

192
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:36,840
had a shit she had um and

193
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:39,090
birth plants sort of accident but she

194
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:40,770
looked fine sbs but if you have

195
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,600
felt different too there was something everyone

196
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,910
kate middleton was like i like i

197
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:46,560
just faced tuned my face but then

198
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,060
it turns out she was actually werewolf

199
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:49,890
yeah but if you had something like

200
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:51,450
that showing up with a skeleton mask

201
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:52,980
first is a good idea to be

202
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:54,750
like then you pull it off people

203
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:56,940
get older just it's just it's just

204
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:58,260
a birth but i mean they're saying

205
00:06:58,290 --> 00:06:59,880
it's it's let's say it's mary holland

206
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:02,100
that's why i'm imagining actual number because

207
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:03,480
i was imagining her coming up to

208
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,310
my house yes and then i'm thinking

209
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:06,480
okay so i know it's her because

210
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:06,720
i know

211
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,390
know what she looks like yeah normally

212
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:11,040
and then i'm seeing that the top

213
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,110
hat part the head is just a

214
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:14,160
skull yeah

215
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:17,460
i think she'd be crying i don't

216
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:19,140
think she'd be like would tears come

217
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:20,160
out if it was just well i

218
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,290
think she'd be distraught y'all know of

219
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:23,700
course you'd be your doctor on top

220
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,410
of the school aren't they on top

221
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:26,850
of the scar on top of the

222
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,100
you they're not underneath the skull are

223
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,720
they or are they i don't know

224
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:33,270
where the paradox the tear ducts i

225
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:35,378
guess are part of the circulatory

226
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,622
system which which are over the school

227
00:07:37,622 --> 00:07:39,150
laid over the school yeah so she

228
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:39,780
wouldn't be crying

229
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:42,930
inner voice should be yeah she'd be

230
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:44,610
wishing she could you know what let's

231
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:45,990
say she can cry and that there's

232
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:47,610
tears coming out of the schools cry

233
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:49,650
i still tell you what it felt

234
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,380
like way to schools cry i think

235
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:55,470
it's still keep her outside ideally your

236
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,720

how many people really hate their wives

322
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:57,890
so let's do a full fifty percent

323
00:10:57,890 --> 00:10:59,960
fifty percent get divorced yeah but

324
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,020
how many divorces are amicable of that

325
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:03,710
fifty percent

326
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:05,900
three percent maybe

327
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:08,337

330
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,570

331
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:15,680

the only one is there was a

457
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:01,070
you know one of those times where

00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:09,170
what the tap part was yeah what

519
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:11,060
did you think it was beer yeah

520
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:13,250
of course it would happen every i

521
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:14,870
think they would probably do it every

522
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:16,280
forty five minutes to make sure that

523
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,210
every customer got

524
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,740
to see one performance and it will

525
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:20,090
be the same performance every time i

526
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:22,010
don't know yeah probably a few lingered

527
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:23,600
you probably wouldn't see the same thing

528
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,820
over yeah yeah maybe maybe you'd see

529
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:27,530
twice and there was like a stage

530
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:29,090

i've been lost for them so it's

971
00:34:22,635 --> 00:34:24,615
ah it's a what it looks like

972
00:34:24,615 --> 00:34:26,565
to me is a pile of gobbledygook

973
00:34:26,685 --> 00:34:28,665
okay where i'm like what is this

974
00:34:28,665 --> 00:34:30,045

00:34:30,045 --> 00:34:31,425
ah the title of this of the

976
00:34:31,425 --> 00:34:31,725
str

977
00:34:31,725 --> 00:34:33,255
and is called something like the first

978
00:34:33,255 --> 00:34:34,365
time it happened i was like my

979
00:34:34,365 --> 00:34:36,195
beautiful minding right now because this as

980
00:34:36,195 --> 00:34:37,905
you are seeing now i'm seeing all

981
00:34:37,905 --> 00:34:40,125
these like just gobbledygook in front of

982
00:34:40,125 --> 00:34:41,625
my head i thought that like ah

983
00:34:41,745 --> 00:34:43,245
you were hitting on someone and maybe

984
00:34:43,365 --> 00:34:46,095
reminding i don't like or you know

985
00:34:46,095 --> 00:34:47,895
body right now i am asking for

986
00:34:47,895 --> 00:34:49,065
will you hold it against me right

987
00:34:49,065 --> 00:34:51,885
now yesterday was the first time i

988
00:34:51,915 --> 00:34:54,345
i could see the words pretty quickly

989
00:34:54,345 --> 00:34:56,025
yeah me and the end of the

990
00:34:56,055 --> 00:34:57,345
first word i guess was one of

991
00:34:57,345 --> 00:34:58,455
the real words and so then i

992
00:34:58,455 --> 00:34:59,235
was like oh i think i get

993
00:34:59,235 --> 00:35:00,675
what the theme is there i needed

994
00:35:00,795 --> 00:35:02,145
two or three hints i say get

995
00:35:02,146 --> 00:35:03,915
a little light bulbs there yeah it's

996
00:35:03,915 --> 00:35:05,505
in beta and i don't think it's

997
00:35:05,505 --> 00:35:07,635
ready for primetime while the numbers one

998
00:35:07,665 --> 00:35:08,835
was in beta and i used to

999
00:35:08,835 --> 00:35:10,515
play it and then lisa numbers it

1000
00:35:10,515 --> 00:35:12,015
was where you you have to

1001
00:35:12,075 --> 00:35:14,175
figure out like they give you ah

1002
00:35:14,205 --> 00:35:15,675
six numbers and then they give you

1003
00:35:15,675 --> 00:35:16,815
the target number and you have to

1004
00:35:16,815 --> 00:35:18,495
figure out how to add and multiply

1005
00:35:18,495 --> 00:35:20,685
and divide the numbers your six numbers

1006
00:35:20,685 --> 00:35:22,305
to reach that target oh my god

1007
00:35:22,815 --> 00:35:23,924
but it was in beta forever and

1008
00:35:23,924 --> 00:35:25,335
since then i went back on it

1009
00:35:25,485 --> 00:35:26,985
and it was like beta has now

1010
00:35:27,015 --> 00:35:29,235
concluded they never eat didn't nobody likes

1011
00:35:29,235 --> 00:35:30,375
that yeah no one liked it this

1012
00:35:30,405 --> 00:35:32,145
transit keyless i also don't like

1013
00:35:32,355 --> 00:35:35,775
the the um score sharing it just

1014
00:35:35,775 --> 00:35:37,425
yeah it's not it doesn't it's not

1015
00:35:37,425 --> 00:35:38,985
as viral as connections are as well

1016
00:35:39,015 --> 00:35:40,335
yeah it doesn't really give you any

1017
00:35:40,335 --> 00:35:41,835
sort of like idea of what happened

1018
00:35:41,835 --> 00:35:43,335
yeah we were in the world rut

1019
00:35:43,335 --> 00:35:44,775
for a while we were it was

1020
00:35:44,775 --> 00:35:46,725
like audit we were automatically sending each

1021
00:35:46,725 --> 00:35:48,375
other worlds yeah we were really young

1022
00:35:48,615 --> 00:35:49,845
and then i think paul's trying to

1023
00:35:49,845 --> 00:35:50,985
break the chain he's going we're not

1024
00:35:50,985 --> 00:35:52,365
gonna keep sending connections every day

1025
00:35:52,365 --> 00:35:53,985
day and then we went we'll still

1026
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:54,945
keep going but you don't have to

1027
00:35:54,945 --> 00:35:56,775
play but it will now you're adding

1028
00:35:56,775 --> 00:36:00,255

usa traders you got a scottish guy

1147
00:40:14,145 --> 00:40:15,345
you should always be someone from a

1148
00:40:15,345 --> 00:40:18,165
different country only interesting you know to

1149
00:40:18,165 --> 00:40:20,565

00:40:20,595 --> 00:40:22,545
get an american over there yeah oh

1151
00:40:22,545 --> 00:40:23,325
what's more mystique

1152
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:25,950
um what if it was like a

1153
00:40:25,950 --> 00:40:28,470
french person that hosted the law you

1154
00:40:28,470 --> 00:40:29,940
can give gifts the sort of the

1155
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,980
air of like we're in a game

1156
00:40:32,010 --> 00:40:34,230
that i am leading you you are

1157
00:40:34,260 --> 00:40:37,200
traitors like like on-coming yeah accent is

1158
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,490
so it doesn't mean well if you're

1159
00:40:38,490 --> 00:40:40,560
just australian it's like oh so you're

1160
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,300
just some guys don't live down the

1161
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:44,160
street yeah it does take

1162
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,420
away a little bit though like sort

1163
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:47,850
of game play mystique there also in

1164
00:40:47,850 --> 00:40:48,690
the australian when they were in a

1165
00:40:48,690 --> 00:40:52,080
hotel instead of a castle and it's

1166
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:53,550
a holiday and instead of

1167
00:40:54,990 --> 00:40:56,730
instead of although it does seem like

1168
00:40:56,730 --> 00:40:58,950
they actually stay there whereas yeah you

1169
00:40:58,950 --> 00:41:01,560
can tell usa yeah they never say

1170
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,450
well in the usa when they don't

1171
00:41:03,450 --> 00:41:05,070
acknowledge that they don't stay there but

1172
00:41:05,070 --> 00:41:06,120
in the u k want it's like

1173
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:07,590
okay the cars are taking you away

1174
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:09,270
now you can't be here i guess

1175
00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:11,310
one thing that is not explained that

1176
00:41:11,310 --> 00:41:13,050
i wouldn't mind being explained as where

1177
00:41:13,050 --> 00:41:14,550
they go and how they're separated so

1178
00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:14,850
that they'd

1179
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,170
never know who the traitor would you

1180
00:41:16,170 --> 00:41:17,970
like to know you know yes oh

1181
00:41:17,970 --> 00:41:20,670
okay sure they essentially stay at a

1182
00:41:20,670 --> 00:41:22,590
holiday express or whatever by the air

1183
00:41:22,590 --> 00:41:24,570
i hope it's not dying there there's

1184
00:41:24,570 --> 00:41:27,030
sequestered like jury style yeah and they

1185
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:28,350
can't talk to talk to each other

1186
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:29,820
so they bring them food and shit

1187
00:41:29,850 --> 00:41:31,470
but they can't see each other talk

1188
00:41:31,470 --> 00:41:33,540
to each other and like so i

1189
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:34,890
guess it must be on different floors

1190
00:41:34,890 --> 00:41:34,980
and

1191
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,330

lauren we talked about the pepsi challenge

1217

00:42:33,690 --> 00:42:35,160
could not know the taste of coke

1219
00:42:35,550 --> 00:42:36,810

00:42:36,810 --> 00:42:38,520
of course she knows the taste of

1221
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:39,810
coke like the back of her hand

1222
00:42:39,810 --> 00:42:41,460

1489
00:52:39,490 --> 00:52:41,440
is why it's really bad was so

yeah r c would have been a

1493
00:52:46,090 --> 00:52:49,270
good pepsi ah comparison yeah probably not

1494
00:52:49,270 --> 00:52:50,320
our c in a million you mean

1495
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:52,090
either but i might never stand for

1496
00:52:52,510 --> 00:52:56,020
royal crown royal crown um or silicon

1497
00:52:56,080 --> 00:52:58,210
was a blast i have to say

1498
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:00,070
it was fun i finished oil is

1499
00:53:00,070 --> 00:53:02,530
if you know of course yeah give

1500
00:53:02,530 --> 00:53:03,430
me the rest of that bot

1501
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:07,521
stands for bottle stands for yeah shortfall

1502
00:53:07,521 --> 00:53:09,580
that was really fun how was really

1503
00:53:09,580 --> 00:53:11,260
fun so now lauren you know what

1504
00:53:11,260 --> 00:53:12,640
the pepsi challenge and i know that

1505
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:13,720
i know the difference between coke and

1506
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:14,920
pepsi and i was right and you

1507
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:17,350
were right and you still like coke

1508
00:53:17,350 --> 00:53:20,020
which is surprising but pepsi was harder

1509
00:53:20,020 --> 00:53:22,300
for me than i thought to determine

1510
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:23,830
the difference between you if this is

1511
00:53:23,860 --> 00:53:24,430
you did

1512
00:53:24,460 --> 00:53:27,250
truly what the advertisements were which is

1513
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:28,750
you move pointed out and said this

1514
00:53:28,750 --> 00:53:30,010
is coke and this is my favorite

1515
00:53:30,010 --> 00:53:31,990
and then we revealed it's it's actually

1516
00:53:31,990 --> 00:53:35,830
and your favorite is pepsi you lying

1517
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:37,660
but but and yet i know that's

1518
00:53:37,660 --> 00:53:39,250
not true yeah but you know what

1519
00:53:39,250 --> 00:53:40,780
i mean like you know what it

1520
00:53:40,780 --> 00:53:42,850
is because you didn't know what it

1521
00:53:42,850 --> 00:53:44,020
was and that was if it's love

1522
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:44,590
