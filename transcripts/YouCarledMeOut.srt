for really i did wild world yeah

14
00:00:38,438 --> 00:00:40,140
and there was something wrong with the

15
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:43,590

17
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:50,305
slightly off weirdly enough so and i

18
00:00:50,305 --> 00:00:52,920
always and what do you mean and

00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:08,250
the girls like such and such what

189
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:10,110
about hugo's well i didn't expect it

190
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:11,460
to get turned around on me like

191
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:13,290
how on earth are you going to

192
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:14,640
write a list of questions nothing they're

193
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,050
going to say and what about you

194
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:16,560
or eve

195
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,470
even when you're writing the questions think

196
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:21,060
of your own answer prompt you to

197
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:22,470
think of your own life i know

198
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:24,116
it was so a guy who who

199
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,950
is like i don't know where he's

200
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:27,750
socially adept or whatever yeah yeah but

201
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:28,920
then he hits it off with one

202
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,600
girl in the first episode and it

203
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:34,560
seems like his real personality is underneath

204
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,720
there somehow who's more at ease

205
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,640
ease but and then this other time

206
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,350
this calls just answering a question she

207
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:41,280
goes on and on and he just

208
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,660
leaves the room and she doesn't know

209
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:44,490
she can't see him he just like

210
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:46,230
done and he just like lee you

211
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:48,090
just leaves that was such a funny

212
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:50,010
power move to me have just like

213
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,081
she's talking and talking he just like

214
00:07:52,081 --> 00:07:54,390
gets but it's not a power do

215
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:55,590
you know that happened to me i

216
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:56,820
earl really

217
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,170
this was many years ago at the

218
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,990
aspen comedy festival and i was there

219
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:03,450
doing driven to drink this one man

220
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:04,620
show that i had written around the

221
00:08:04,626 --> 00:08:09,570
time and in this show i told

222
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:12,750
this disgusting story about ah mopping up

223
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:15,120
a bar table with a rag and

224
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,890
then squeezing the rag into a glass

225
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:16,980
and

226
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,320
drinking it um because you are so

227
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,250
hungry for alcohol

228
00:08:35,261 --> 00:08:36,390
the phrasing is

229
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:45,810
because somebody had dared one of us

230
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:47,610
to do it and then wants the

231
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:49,110
first person did it then we all

232
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:50,250
felt like we had to do it

233
00:08:50,466 --> 00:08:51,990
that's not how that works no it's

234
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:52,470
terrible

235
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:56,100
um but after the after the shows

236
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,840
of the last night and i met

237
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:00,180
you know there's some party wrap party

238
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:04,230
for the whole festival and a ah

239
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,630
a guy came up to me and

240
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:09,630
ah i forget he worked for something

241
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:11,400
or other in the business some network

242
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,200
or something and

243
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,510
and he said you know i really

244
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:16,890
liked your story i really liked your

245
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,360
show and the story was so crazy

246
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:20,850
and i was trying to tell this

247
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:25,470

248
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:26,820

249
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:29,160
there and this guy calls him over

250
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,240
and says oh you have to hear

251
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,460
this story and i'm like well it's

252
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:33,360
his bed

00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:35,970
story is better to show x kind

254
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:37,500
of a full bit and the guy

255
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:40,500
was like really pressuring me and so

256
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,660
i was like okay ah so i

257
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:44,370
started to tell the story and then

258
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:47,280
the soon to be famous guy just

259
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:49,320
kind of looked away and then walked

260
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,240
away in the middle of it i

261
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,770

266
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,760
and and to his credit this guy

00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,930
didn't want to tell it so why

268
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:03,990

people have like a problem with someone

306
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:20,745
from their past and then this guy

i don't know that i have like

315
00:11:35,283 --> 00:11:37,155

but i don't know i mean i

317
00:11:38,655 --> 00:11:39,165
don't know if i would do it

318
00:11:39,165 --> 00:11:40,515
in that context but it's kind of

319
00:11:40,515 --> 00:11:42,285
a safe context like there's ah there's

320
00:11:42,285 --> 00:11:43,215
like a girl who was kicked out

321
00:11:43,215 --> 00:11:44,745
of her sorority and she never understood

322
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:45,975
why so then this guy kind of

323
00:11:45,975 --> 00:11:47,685
like why was connected with all these

324
00:11:47,685 --> 00:11:48,795
people she's a bitch

325
00:11:51,045 --> 00:11:52,755
she's a basic bitch but i mean

326
00:11:52,755 --> 00:11:53,955

331
00:12:04,035 --> 00:12:06,135
podcast and and you hear it yeah

00:12:25,485 --> 00:12:29,145
was famous and gave only the cds

341
00:12:29,145 --> 00:12:30,462

346
00:12:42,465 --> 00:12:43,125
never acknowledge

347
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:45,405
knowledge that the cds were lent by

348
00:12:45,405 --> 00:12:47,025
that guy he just was like oh

349
00:12:47,025 --> 00:12:48,435
i thought this was a cool music

350
00:12:48,435 --> 00:12:49,575

353
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:55,755
even he just wanted to say thank

354
00:12:55,755 --> 00:12:56,925
you and then he would call them

355
00:12:56,926 --> 00:12:58,125
asking for the cds all the time

356
00:12:58,125 --> 00:12:59,475

357
00:12:59,475 --> 00:13:00,525
he one of the bad guys want

358
00:13:00,525 --> 00:13:01,755
them back at this point because they're

359
00:13:02,062 --> 00:13:03,225
because they're rare right

360
00:13:03,795 --> 00:13:06,525
and then the host takes that guy

361
00:13:06,525 --> 00:13:09,105
to movies hulu movies house and then

362
00:13:09,105 --> 00:13:10,725

363
00:13:10,725 --> 00:13:13,425

knew who was coming over and stuff

367
00:13:17,835 --> 00:13:19,965
he just maybe didn't know why he

368
00:13:19,995 --> 00:13:22,305
did but he allowed it and used

369
00:13:22,305 --> 00:13:23,445

was invited to a special box you

501
00:18:16,755 --> 00:18:19,125
know and i was like that's the

502
00:18:19,125 --> 00:18:19,575
only way

503
00:18:21,195 --> 00:18:22,635
some some at some points i was

504
00:18:22,635 --> 00:18:24,045
thinking to be cooler to be in

505
00:18:24,045 --> 00:18:26,295
the stands actually which i hadn't done

506
00:18:26,295 --> 00:18:27,315

you've never had coffee in your life

586

gauntlet thrown

00:22:33,205 --> 00:22:37,315
down by pepsi and they said essentially

626
00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:39,805
coke is better than is not as

627
00:22:39,805 --> 00:22:41,297

how do you remember

635
00:22:55,015 --> 00:22:56,395

00:22:56,395 --> 00:22:57,925
the episode all right so they're actually

637
00:22:57,925 --> 00:22:59,345
sleeping in a low that's right you

638
00:22:59,374 --> 00:23:00,854
listen to all of our episodes yesterday

639
00:23:01,325 --> 00:23:05,845
french canadian um so ah they would

640
00:23:05,845 --> 00:23:08,215
blindfold people yeah and they wouldn't they

641
00:23:08,215 --> 00:23:11,425
would leave them to a bunker probably

642
00:23:11,425 --> 00:23:13,075
fifteen miles away yeah it's covered with

643
00:23:13,075 --> 00:23:13,495
spiders

644
00:23:13,525 --> 00:23:15,745
so you wouldn't know where you were

645
00:23:15,775 --> 00:23:16,885
yeah they would drive around in a

646
00:23:16,885 --> 00:23:18,385
circle for a while so yeah notions

647
00:23:18,385 --> 00:23:19,675
of direction yeah yeah then they'd spin

648
00:23:19,675 --> 00:23:21,115
you around put you in this bunker

649
00:23:21,415 --> 00:23:22,675
and then you had to put your

650
00:23:22,675 --> 00:23:25,135
hand in some spaghetti yeah and then

651
00:23:25,135 --> 00:23:26,785
someone would crouch behind you and they

652
00:23:26,785 --> 00:23:28,615
would push you over yeah but as

653
00:23:28,615 --> 00:23:30,445

656
00:23:33,685 --> 00:23:35,095
blindfold or you would take sips of

657
00:23:35,095 --> 00:23:36,625
pets not hard at all that's the

658
00:23:36,625 --> 00:23:38,575
easiest test of the world you think

827

really cool of me what other animals

are sly besides foxes any i know

829
00:29:19,585 --> 00:29:21,565
because why do they have that railways

830
00:29:21,565 --> 00:29:23,606
wondering they have that right because what

831
00:29:23,606 --> 00:29:26,725
what they sit around killing things they

832
00:29:26,725 --> 00:29:28,795
sneaky around only like

833
00:29:29,022 --> 00:29:30,475
feel like snakes are kind of sly

834
00:29:31,405 --> 00:29:33,265
yeah they're always in these holes in

835
00:29:33,265 --> 00:29:34,915
there but they have slither so that's

836
00:29:34,915 --> 00:29:36,835
the sell for them they only get

837
00:29:36,835 --> 00:29:39,985
one cell yeah yeah alright bears get

838
00:29:39,985 --> 00:29:40,585
sleepy

839
00:29:41,845 --> 00:29:44,995
lions get slutty it's like yes

840
00:29:46,165 --> 00:29:47,125
frogs are slippery

841
00:29:49,195 --> 00:29:50,815
seals are slutty

842
00:29:52,465 --> 00:29:55,704
so those lines oh i just i

843
00:29:55,704 --> 00:29:57,295
just lay on the bank yes

844
00:29:58,555 --> 00:30:01,645
which animals are the sleaziest animals wow

845
00:30:04,165 --> 00:30:06,745
i know everyone's got their theories like

846
00:30:06,745 --> 00:30:09,265
which ones sleep around a lot yeah

847
00:30:09,565 --> 00:30:11,215
they don't have the same partner i

848
00:30:11,215 --> 00:30:12,685
always feel bad for animals when you

849
00:30:12,685 --> 00:30:15,205
read these stories about like how spiders

850
00:30:15,205 --> 00:30:16,945
made or whatever it's like oh so

851
00:30:16,945 --> 00:30:18,775
then you know the spider puts out

852
00:30:18,775 --> 00:30:21,115
a huge pheromone and then goes and

853
00:30:21,115 --> 00:30:22,285
has it's way with the

854
00:30:22,405 --> 00:30:23,725
male spider and then it lays a

855
00:30:23,725 --> 00:30:25,615
millionaire eggs then the spider eats it

856
00:30:25,615 --> 00:30:27,655
or something like aspose just sounds so

857
00:30:27,655 --> 00:30:29,635
bad for the female spider it does

858
00:30:29,815 --> 00:30:32,245
actually seems only for all female racers

859
00:30:32,245 --> 00:30:34,885
so compassionate and you're such i know

860
00:30:34,885 --> 00:30:38,215
we're allies were like allied cats female

861
00:30:38,215 --> 00:30:40,465
cats like wow i'll give it to

862
00:30:40,465 --> 00:30:42,175
me and then it's happening

863
00:30:43,125 --> 00:30:43,455
yeah

864
00:30:44,595 --> 00:30:47,175
stop doing that anger yes you do

865
00:30:47,205 --> 00:30:49,185
while we've already talked about animal penises

866
00:30:49,185 --> 00:30:51,195
but cats have barbed yes yeah yeah

867
00:30:51,195 --> 00:30:54,405
yeah nothing about the snake yes why

868
00:30:54,435 --> 00:30:56,025
do they why do they do it

869
00:30:56,025 --> 00:30:57,285
and yet i don't know you with

870
00:30:57,285 --> 00:30:58,785
everyday no more cats why would the

871
00:30:58,785 --> 00:31:00,945
cats evolved to the point where the

872
00:31:00,945 --> 00:31:04,725
female goes crazy like hey everybody

873
00:31:04,755 --> 00:31:07,515
come and give me sex yeah and

874
00:31:07,515 --> 00:31:08,985
then the male cat has the bar

875
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:10,665
penis so that she can't run away

876
00:31:10,695 --> 00:31:13,215

957
00:34:13,635 --> 00:34:16,455
a hug and doesn't have one and

958
00:34:16,455 --> 00:34:18,405
so this elephant takes him around to

look for where he's gonna get a

960
00:34:19,665 --> 00:34:22,785

decide on a taboo word by texting

1235
00:44:28,105 --> 00:44:31,765

to organically try to get the third

1243
00:44:47,935 --> 00:44:49,885
player to say it we're not allowed

1244
00:44:49,885 --> 00:44:52,705
to say it ourselves the third player

1245
00:44:52,705 --> 00:44:54,865
has to try to

1246
00:44:54,865 --> 00:44:55,885
avoid saying it

1247
00:44:57,205 --> 00:44:59,215
