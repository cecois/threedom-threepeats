189
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:52,770
i mean eternally like it's just like

190
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:55,590
they didn't internally they're very utilitarian and

191
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:57,780
and and depressing it's true and they

192
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:59,100
could be nice if they're going to

193
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:01,200
be if you know that nice you're

194
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:03,420
my nice

195
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:09,330
if you note that these agencies are

196
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:11,040
going to be around for decades and

197
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,990
decades and decades why not but you

198
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:14,790

that he had done something wrong and

317
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:16,640
he was denying that he had done

318
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:20,480

00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:39,680
that he realized he was wrong and

330
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,800

419
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,830

older humans this concept the wait how

428
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,470

429
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:04,610
to be like close to the same

430
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:05,240
age

431
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:06,830
he have to be only fourteen years

432
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:10,100
older than her well yeah he'd have

433
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,210
to be only fourteen years old but

434
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:13,370
that's that lines up with where you're

435
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:15,620

436
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:17,660

old

439
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:21,890
it it could be you can adjust

440
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:22,490

00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:28,160

00:19:18,325 --> 00:19:19,550
the thing we were forced to do

556
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:21,140
no yeah kinda considering like when was

557
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:22,490
the first color movie because the first

558
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:23,480
one i can think of is like

559
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,490
you know wizard of oz that eighteen

560
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:27,770
thirty whatever sort of us it wasn't

561
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:28,936
the first no it wasn't the first

562
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:30,170
thing i wonder when i can go

563
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:32,150
cool as a way to reveal color

564
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:33,860
of just like well first coding movie

565
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,780
it's gonna happen yeah but i guess

566
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:37,610
my point is is like there were

567
00:19:37,610 --> 00:19:38,690
black and white movie i mean there

568
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:39,860
still are but i mean there were

569
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:41,690
commonly black and white movies through the

570
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:44,270
sixty yes thirty years after color was

571
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:45,530
still exist and there's just that much

572
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:48,140
cheaper i think it's a certain aesthetic

573
00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:50,330
here's a reference lauren might not get

574
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:52,370
if we go back i like this

575
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:54,170
feature side note the first film shot

576
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:56,300
color was cupid angling made eight nineteen

577
00:19:56,330 --> 00:19:58,700
eighteen the wizard of oz and gone

578
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:00,141
with the wind were made in technicolor

579
00:20:00,141 --> 00:20:01,520
in nineteen thirty nine and processed that

580
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,600
have been around for quite some time

581
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,790
by then there were hand-coloured segments in

582
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:06,470
movies dating back to nineteen o two

583
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:09,320
yeah like what's his name linda turner

584
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:11,270
okay tell me your story but you

585
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:13,760
know like hand coloring each each frame

586
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:14,292
wow

587
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:17,190
like pencils and stuff when we were

588
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:19,140
ah i would say this this was

589
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:22,950
the eighties into the nineties while it

590
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:26,370
was like hollywood into the nineties black

591
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:28,590
and white headshots like everyone else yeah

592
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:30,090
shots i did i had like did

593
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:31,200
you have like i'm gonna chuck i'm

594
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,670
no i didn't but i got them

595
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:33,780
when i got mine for the first

596
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:35,160
time color was pretty

597
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,890
the new yeah well yeah doesn't why

598
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:41,190
because color had shots ah were you

599
00:20:41,190 --> 00:20:42,720
could have made them think was more

600
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:43,950
but it was weird it was a

601
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:45,240
weird it was more expensive like if

602
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,320
you if you were like i remember

603
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,090
when color headshots were introduced it was

604
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:49,680
like are people really gonna go for

605
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,630
color shots like they want to know

606
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:53,670
what color my hair and eyes make

607
00:20:53,678 --> 00:20:55,290
so much more sense yeah

608
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:57,210
for so long now i have for

609
00:20:57,210 --> 00:20:59,040
so long the last time you had

610
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,390
to have black and white headshots last

611
00:21:00,390 --> 00:21:02,460
headshots i ever took in ninety seven

612
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:04,500
i think were black-and-white yeah yeah it

613
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,270
was weird wow it was very weird

614
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:09,330
is strange yeah it was kooky it

615
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:11,550
was nice it was creepy and it's

616
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:14,396
completely hidden bouquet and you're lucky it

617
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,420
was altogether

618
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:15,690
ooh

619
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,180
no and if as i write a

620
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:20,370
song if the rules are that ix

621
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,110
altogether oogie huh

622
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:24,091
so i wish there was a third

623
00:21:24,091 --> 00:21:26,940
okie word but he's kooky spooky yeah

624
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:28,320
it must have been like trying to

625
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,600
save the actors money right because there's

626
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,370
no other explanation for i think it

627
00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:35,250
was more expensive but but i think

628
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:36,720
it was trying to gouge the donors

629
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,250
don't you it was more expensive to

630
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:39,540
do black and white why wouldn't it

631
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:41,370
lasting director wanna have it have a

632
00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:42,000
color

633
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:43,860
because they're not paying for the headshots

634
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:45,090
but don't they want to but don't

635
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:47,100
they want to know what why wouldn't

636
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:49,080
they can direct you would have to

637
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:50,880
like my movie's gonna be in color

638
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,590
and it's like yeah casting it based

639
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:54,082
on how people look doesn't want any

640
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,470
chance there's whole thing doesn't make any

641
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:57,060
sense i feel like we're living in

642
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:58,920
a alternate reality where like that can't

643
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,810
be the path all the money fold

644
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:02,220
that's a good point shot

645
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,750
good point paul do you have do

646
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:04,560

00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,520
like it must have gone with you

690
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:21,960
i remember one time going with my

691
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,820
friend bryan whalen and i had never

692
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:25,260
seen it on a big screen before

693
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:26,520
and we sat in the very front

694
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,600
row this in ramadan which is a

695
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,270
massive theater here in los angeles and

were in the movie

699
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:36,270
it was yeah that's sad it was

700
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:37,770
a lot of fun so you wouldn't

701
00:23:37,770 --> 00:23:38,970
pick that because you already felt like

702
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:40,950
you're in it yeah exactly so i

703
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:42,900

704
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:44,790
time that they were restoring that movie

to be in a movie where i

729
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:36,810
got to be like an a like

730
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:38,130
a period piece like that like where

731
00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:39,240
it's like fifties

732
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:40,950
yeah that'd be so fun i wonder

733
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:43,410
if that's a ah a slight generational

734
00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:46,020
thing because we're just a few years

735
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:48,090
apart but i don't have the same

736
00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:49,232
love for but even though i loved

00:24:49,232 --> 00:24:51,000
it i saw it it didn't it

738
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,920

show she found the toilet yeah you're

854
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:47,190
not far off and it may just

855
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:48,563
as much since she

856
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:50,340
spun around in a circle oh i

857
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:51,420

diana prince because she's born wonder woman

865
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,730

870
00:29:19,285 --> 00:29:20,910

cut to the chase we didn't see

970
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:44,440
a single whale ah it was freezing

971
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:44,920
cold

972
00:32:45,010 --> 00:32:46,720
freezing cold to the point where and

973
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,850
it was summer there but they will

974
00:32:48,910 --> 00:32:51,640
rent you these outfits these fucking like

975
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,800
coveralls to wear because when you're on

976
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,150
the deck of the boat the wind

977
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:58,780
is so bitter it it whips through

978
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:00,220
you is like doha with it on

979
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:02,740
land not hot okay not hot this

980
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:03,820
was there somewhere and it was still

981
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:05,140
like it was not hot by sea

982
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:09,370
how had we went we were sky

983
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,370
how hot was it under the earth

984
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,920
how hot and molten cores inside your

985
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,510
heart ties your works to the way

986
00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:18,640
i was never arrive my heart stopped

987
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:22,150
with whale hate ah it was when

988
00:33:22,270 --> 00:33:23,680
thou saw a whale would you have

989
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,900
murdered it yeah sure you have just

990
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:27,370
part of the trip just to establish

991
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:29,230
dominance right of course i would've said

992
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:30,520
although they they do

993
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:33,520
have um they still do serve whale

994
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:35,350
in some places they have that's right

995
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:36,310
yeah and they have signs in the

996
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:38,410
windows of restaurants that don't serve well

997
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:40,810
in case you're concerning the highway like

998
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:42,550
a we're not doing that whale sade

999
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:45,490
archaic thing where there's like say there's

1000
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:46,870
a big movement to not do it

1001
00:33:46,870 --> 00:33:47,783
anymore there is because

1002
00:33:48,836 --> 00:33:51,550
think anyways well because there's there's yes

1003
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:52,750
now it's like no one needs that

1004
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:54,610
i mean wills we kill any so

1005
00:33:54,610 --> 00:33:56,440
many things is it whales are almost

1006
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:57,670
extinct is that what it is like

1007
00:33:57,670 --> 00:33:59,350
there no they're so big that they're

1008
00:33:59,350 --> 00:34:01,150
scary like i did i bet there

1009
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:02,740
there's only room for like three of

1010
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:04,870
them yeah because you kill one you

1011
00:34:04,870 --> 00:34:06,490
feed every restaurant in town

1012
00:34:07,930 --> 00:34:10,720
right there killing these whales by the

1013
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:13,720
millions i don't i think it's because

1014
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:15,190
of the certain type of whale i

1015
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:17,140
think it probably is an extinction issue

1016
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:18,820
not that the whales are are in

1017
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:20,350
danger these whales might not be in

1018
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:21,850
danger of extinction but it's just because

1019
00:34:21,850 --> 00:34:25,660
it's it used to be purely necessity

1020
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:27,490
it was the only thing people could

1021
00:34:27,490 --> 00:34:27,670
do

1022
00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:29,650
there and now it's not right you

1023
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:31,360
know but there are certain things that

1024
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:34,690
we kill any that we that we're

1025
00:34:34,690 --> 00:34:36,790
fine with get a whale or a

1026
00:34:36,790 --> 00:34:38,710
dolphin it's like no we take trips

1027
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:39,820
out on boats to look at them

1028
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:42,610
we can't kill them yes but people

1029
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:43,420
i mean it's the same thing with

1030
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:46,180
like safari people who kill animals that

1031
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:47,860
are like that right elephant

1032
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,330
yeah i mean you when you when

1033
00:34:49,330 --> 00:34:51,580
you yeah that and that's even worse

1034
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:53,230
is just a trade it's just virtual

1035
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:54,700
vs yes but is it does get

1036
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:56,260
into the thing of when you zoom

1037
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,340
out to the macro like do we

1038
00:34:57,340 --> 00:34:58,660
need to be killing any we don't

1039
00:34:58,690 --> 00:35:00,250
need to be killing any animals at

1040
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:02,710
all no no no but i think

1041
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:03,880
with with the whales it is in

1042
00:35:03,910 --> 00:35:06,130
danger of it isn't an issue of

1043
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,020
endangerment and being an then

1044
00:35:08,050 --> 00:35:10,750
being overfished if that's a term i

1045
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:12,580
think it is yeah but that it's

1046
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:15,400
it's it's such a um it's such

1047
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:18,550
a huge waste of a life because

1048
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:20,290
there are these gigantic creatures and it's

1049
00:35:20,890 --> 00:35:23,140
city isn't doing a great value because

1050
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:24,400
it's like if you're gonna kill anything

1051
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,720
killed the biggest thing and then you

1052
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:26,860
get so much meat out of it

1053
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:28,167
but they only eat

1054
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:30,850
the eyes oh that's good

1055
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:33,910
throw the rest away they shove it

1056
00:35:33,910 --> 00:35:35,500
back in the sea shiver back in

1057
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:36,790
the sea

1058
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:38,920
oh so anyway i'm sure we're on

1059
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:41,110
this boat the whale watching boat and

1060
00:35:41,110 --> 00:35:43,390
the the weather was crazy the wind

1061
00:35:43,390 --> 00:35:45,580
was so high that the boat was

1062
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:47,620
crew just it was nuts it was

1063
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:49,570
just going straight up and cannot stand

1064
00:35:49,570 --> 00:35:51,010
that if people were off people were

1065
00:35:51,010 --> 00:35:52,900
throwing up left and right that's like

1066
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,160
those plane rides you hear where it's

1067
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,990
like sudden drops in altitude and everyone's

1068
00:35:56,110 --> 00:35:57,970
like yeah everywhere die

1069
00:35:58,180 --> 00:35:59,140
even that i don't know if that

1070
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:00,469
would make me throw up the move

1071
00:36:00,469 --> 00:36:01,750
made me freak out for sure but

1072
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:03,460
on a boat i just offering gao

1073
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:07,450
what what do you think it is

1074
00:36:07,450 --> 00:36:08,920
about you playing you insane

1075
00:36:10,450 --> 00:36:11,740
i think i have a great centre

1076
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:13,480
of it's i don't know no it's

1077
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:15,010
purely just genetics right i think it's

1078
00:36:15,010 --> 00:36:16,240
just luck of the draw yeah like

1079
00:36:16,270 --> 00:36:17,950
like and that's how they find astronauts

1080
00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:19,540
because they put him through that centrifuge

1081
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:21,250
and oh god i right well let's

1082
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:22,150
see if this is one of the

1083
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:23,680
humans that doesn't throw up from the

1084
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,150
base who's doing the salience

1085
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:28,420
bailey and test us this is one

1086
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:30,190

i mean like i want to know

1088
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,380
what i wouldn't be able to do

1089
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:33,580
it but they say that i mean

1090
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:35,740
there are certainly ways to detonate um

1091
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:38,320
by trying to make sure your eyes

1092
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,090

on a couple of boats here and

1174
00:39:23,650 --> 00:39:25,120
there where it's just like i gotta

1175
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:26,590
get off this fucking true that's how

1176
00:39:26,590 --> 00:39:27,640
i feel every much a second amount

1177
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:27,700
of

1178
00:39:28,330 --> 00:39:29,620
can you be in lauren can you

1179
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:30,790
be in a car of someone else's

1180
00:39:30,790 --> 00:39:32,620
driving i can but not in the

1181
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:34,000
back seat and if i am in

1182
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,410
the backseat i can't really like look

1183
00:39:35,410 --> 00:39:36,820
at my phone at all or like

1184
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:39,010
do any oh wow i will immediately

1185
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:40,750
feel really sick some people all they

1186
00:39:40,750 --> 00:39:41,680
can do is look in the phone

1187
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,150
because otherwise they'll get sick oh yeah

1188
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:44,500
no after country and to kind of

1189
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:46,750
stairs middle and the window what does

1190
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:47,860
it make any sense because

1191
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:49,420
is the reason you get six because

1192
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:51,970
your your vision is not lining up

1193
00:39:51,970 --> 00:39:53,470
with what your inner ear is doing

1194
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:54,730
so if you're looking at if you're

1195
00:39:54,730 --> 00:39:56,500
reading or looking at the phone your

1196
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:58,420
inner ear senses you're moving but your

1197
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:00,760
eyes are sensing standing still what about

1198
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:03,790
people with robot arms i forgot sorry

1199
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:05,980
that i can't say look up centre

1200
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:07,990
window like the the driver window

1201
00:40:08,050 --> 00:40:09,070
if you look out the driver window

1202
00:40:09,070 --> 00:40:10,420
then you can see where you're going

1203
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:11,950
like the driver never gets car sick

1204
00:40:11,950 --> 00:40:15,640
because he or she is actually affect

1205
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:19,360
or they are actually affecting the movements

1206
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:22,390
of the car the alfa yeah exactly

1207
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:25,330
i'm this car is my dog i

1208
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:27,970
control every move it makes so i

1209
00:40:27,970 --> 00:40:28,150
feel

1210
00:40:28,935 --> 00:40:30,525
although the driver i have gotten carsick

1211
00:40:30,525 --> 00:40:33,675
driving before really yeah because it's like

1212
00:40:33,705 --> 00:40:35,115
you know boo

1213
00:40:35,175 --> 00:40:36,375
no we don't want like that crazy

1214
00:40:36,405 --> 00:40:37,755
taxi you know what it was it

1215
00:40:37,755 --> 00:40:39,285
was i realised this when i bring

1216
00:40:39,285 --> 00:40:40,815
more research on it it's that i

1217
00:40:40,815 --> 00:40:43,035
was in a windy road and i

1218
00:40:43,125 --> 00:40:44,565
was listening to the music really loud

1219
00:40:44,565 --> 00:40:45,465
and it was it must have been

1220
00:40:45,465 --> 00:40:47,865
affecting my my inner ear so i

1221
00:40:47,865 --> 00:40:49,695
just turned off the music and rolled

1222
00:40:49,695 --> 00:40:51,045
down the window and then you feel

1223
00:40:51,045 --> 00:40:53,085
better because you're actually like oh music

1224
00:40:53,085 --> 00:40:55,095
effects your inner ear we were driving

1225
00:40:55,095 --> 00:40:55,245

00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:45,230
like how the peachtree goes so you're

1480
00:50:45,230 --> 00:50:46,550
in the middle of a boring conversation

1481
00:50:46,550 --> 00:50:48,230

1482
00:50:48,230 --> 00:50:50,150

and paul will have a conversation okay

1487
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:02,810

1488
00:51:02,810 --> 00:51:03,350
mole

1489
00:51:04,010 --> 00:51:05,660

you had not at all and actually

1492
00:51:08,750 --> 00:51:09,800
they didn't even have to remove it

1493
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:12,020
so the um it was all fine

1494
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:13,250
but you could have had it removed

1495
00:51:13,250 --> 00:51:15,470

00:51:15,860 --> 00:51:17,390

1520
00:52:08,150 --> 00:52:09,860
that you can i know you have

1521
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:11,540
to take the cancer part out but

1522
00:52:11,540 --> 00:52:13,700
can you make it look like i

1523
00:52:13,700 --> 00:52:15,680
still have the mole because it's a

1524
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:17,360
birthmark you know i was born with

1525
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:18,920
it yes i

1526
00:52:20,150 --> 00:52:23,840
just on that i catalogued fourteen

1527
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:34,130
i catalogued fourteen new books at the

1528
00:52:34,130 --> 00:52:36,650
library today oh that had to be

1529
00:52:36,650 --> 00:52:38,990
tagged with the labels and i had

1530
00:52:39,170 --> 00:52:40,400
actually it's not related to what you

1531
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:42,470
said i said on that but it's

1532
00:52:42,470 --> 00:52:44,690
completely unrelated i see a connection though

1533
00:52:44,690 --> 00:52:46,790
actually but continued with historical tags

1534
00:52:49,070 --> 00:52:53,390
so i had to label them scott

1535
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:57,170
and yes it was very hard because

1536
00:52:57,170 --> 00:52:58,760
the printer kept breaking go on

1537
00:53:00,050 --> 00:53:01,772
and she works at the library so

1538
00:53:01,772 --> 00:53:03,320
i couldn't really get the numbers out

1539
00:53:03,650 --> 00:53:05,300
and so you so but it was

1540
00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:06,830
print ten more books than you had

1541
00:53:06,830 --> 00:53:08,780
planned on cataloguing that's why it was

1542
00:53:08,780 --> 00:53:11,780
really a big issue yeah yeah yeah

1543
00:53:11,930 --> 00:53:12,290
yeah

1544
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:16,970
ah um go on

1545
00:53:18,470 --> 00:53:21,410
so i ended up i'd feel it

1546
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:23,090
i ended up getting it done because

1547
00:53:23,090 --> 00:53:25,280

00:57:06,710 --> 00:57:09,680
but um you know i i feel

1646
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:11,240
like because i work the extra hours

1647
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:13,820
i should get the extra pay but

1648
00:57:13,820 --> 00:57:16,670
i was willing to take more time

1649
00:57:16,670 --> 00:57:19,100
off at a later tusk so that

1650
00:57:19,100 --> 00:57:21,200
i don't i'll trade you the money

1651
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:23,480
for less hours for the same money

1652
00:57:23,930 --> 00:57:26,210
you know so essentially it

1653
00:57:26,210 --> 00:57:28,100
it's like i'm not asking for um

1654
00:57:30,890 --> 00:57:34,400
oh no asking for anything special so

1655
00:57:34,460 --> 00:57:35,720
totally i'm just saying let me leave

1656
00:57:35,750 --> 00:57:37,220
early and then act like i was

1657
00:57:37,220 --> 00:57:38,840
there as a little yes that's exactly

1658
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:40,370
you want it so yeah just really

1659
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:43,936
i'm gonna have to go because i

1660
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,500
don't know if you root access so

1661
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:47,900
interesting what you're talking about i'm sure

1662
00:57:47,900 --> 00:57:49,340
it's here the rest later

1663
00:57:49,918 --> 00:57:52,790
you're fucking me is very insulting

1664
00:57:54,650 --> 00:57:56,480
see the degree of difficulty is harder

1665
00:57:56,570 --> 00:57:58,850
okay now you want and then you're

1666
00:57:58,850 --> 00:58:00,020
good on the island guys got

1667
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:02,330
so i don't consider it to be

1668
00:58:02,390 --> 00:58:04,790
money-laundering i mean it's you know purely

1669
00:58:04,790 --> 00:58:07,100

place and try something different with it

1673
00:58:12,140 --> 00:58:14,750

1674
00:58:14,750 --> 00:58:17,840
