33
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,970
hat is a captain it's illogical cap

34
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:25,740
it's a nautical cap but yeah okay

35
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:26,640
with my rank is

36
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:30,030
well are there any stripes or stars

37
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:32,490
there's no in the signia anything captain

38
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:35,490
of captain antonio fame have some sort

39
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:37,950
of rank he was well okay yes

40
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:40,380
but to me it wasn't indicated upon

41
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:43,470
his hat know he had i believe

42
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:45,570
he he had many captains hats as

43
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:47,610
we call them sure um and they

44
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:48,000
usually

45
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:50,970
had like the the traditional lifesaver with

46
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:54,270
some rope around is that no i

47
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:56,880
think that was purposely to say this

48
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,340
is not stolen valor i'm not i'm

49
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:00,930
not trying to pretend i'm in some

50
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:02,700
sort of navy i'm just a rich

51
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,470
guy as a boat oh wow so

52
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:06,510
so but it seems to me as

53
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:08,100
if all captain's hats from

54
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,930
then on in have had that lifesaver

55
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:11,550
with the rope around yeah did he

56
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:14,430
start that no no okay so this

57
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:15,600
is you think he said i'm gonna

58
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,130
call myself captain i better invent a

59
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:19,230
hat but i don't know what about

60
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:20,970
the anchor with a rope around it

61
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:23,040
isn't that a common theme that's a

62
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,530
common symbol though the united states navy

63
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:26,790
there are certain ranks where that would

64
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:28,320
be the insignia on your cow

65
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,940
yeah i think it's the anchor with

66
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:32,280
petty officer it's it's an anchor with

67
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,240
a rope and it says u s

68
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,980
n on it and so too i

69
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:36,720
think i honestly think this is just

70
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,760
me assuming i think it is to

71
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:42,060
avoid the confusion you're not saying i

72
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:44,010
am in the military rhymes just a

73
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:46,200
rich guy owns a boat or i

74
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,310
want you to think i am and

75
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:48,480
that's where you are you're

76
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,680

78
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,170
you're just saying i like this which

79
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:58,080
would you and i'm not saying that

80
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,270
you'd have to spend money on it

81
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:02,160
to the exclusion of something else that

82
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,590
you'd rather have but if you had

83
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:06,510
a boat yeah would you would like

84
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:08,790
that yeah i would i wouldn't want

85
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:10,530
anything less than a boat

86
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:15,540
there's nothing there less than a bicycle

87
00:03:15,701 --> 00:03:17,640
you listen to the wrong inflection there's

88
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:18,660
nothing in the world i would want

89
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:20,370

not like boats at all i don't

95
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:34,080

see sick very easily that's a big

97
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:38,250
problem and i don't think it's fun

98
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:40,200
do you think the one has to

99
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:44,340
do with the yeah definitely i'm just

100
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:45,990
not charmed by a boat and you

101
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:47,070

102
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:49,200
with the main oh no

103
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,490

106
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:54,660
a boat i probably could but what's

107
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,280

did but it's very fun but it

199
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:01,320
was very powerful crazy to see people

200
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:04,620
in hollywood here going thirty five miles

201
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:08,280
an hour through busy traffic just like

202
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:11,250
and swerving around having fun it's bad

203
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,450
i do it by the beach so

204
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:14,250
that seems fun somebody who's doing it

205
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:16,860
against traffic the other day right like

206
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:18,330
what we're having to be a law

207
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:19,980
was wearing a helmet and oh yeah

208
00:07:20,017 --> 00:07:21,270
you just you know the whole thing

209
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:22,530
is they have a whole i watched

210
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:24,840
this like buzzfeed show on netflix about

211
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,190
that about the bird scooter and you

212
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:27,780
said i'm boring yeah i know

213
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,650
goodbye but they said one of the

214
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,730
like in that it was like one

215
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:34,349
of the rules with them legally as

216
00:07:34,349 --> 00:07:35,430
you have to wear a helmet but

217
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:37,590
then no no one helped me with

218
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:39,270
never seen a single part while the

219
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:41,760
idea here is a helmet with a

220
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:45,210
horn yeah hopefully yeah hoping to get

221
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:46,830
well i hope i get one the

222
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:48,450
idea i think the idea what that

223
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:48,900
is

224
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:51,600
they are supposed to ah they can

225
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,450
be a help to people who um

226
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:56,700
either don't have a car or yeah

227
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:58,170
or don't want to use a car

228
00:07:58,170 --> 00:08:00,000
or don't or there's no or public

229
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,650
transportation is not an aid to them

230
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:03,240
where they want to go nowhere they

231
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,280
can get the bird scooter they could

232
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,710
bring a helmet with them get the

233
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:09,090
shooter and then i've never

234
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,800
seen a single person wear a helmet

235
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:11,850
on one of the things is how

236
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:13,350
do you get back like you can

237
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:14,790
you take it inside wherever you're gonna

238
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:16,320
go so no one grabs it you

239
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,760
know and otherwise you're like shit out

240
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,290
of luck wherever you are i think

241
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:20,850
so i mean i don't know how

242
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:23,310
the i don't know how the um

243
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:26,010
the the the payment works on that

244
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:27,480
like if you have it for an

245
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:29,280
unranked i think it i

246
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,780
i assumed it was i think he

247
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,250
was a certain amount of yeah once

248
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:34,170
you turn it off you're you're you

249
00:08:34,170 --> 00:08:36,270
stop paying but i think then people

250
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:37,380
have an app where they can go

251
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:39,390
find these scooters anywhere and what yeah

252
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:40,500
what if they find the one that

253
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,630
you need to get back home right

254
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:44,400
and then you also have to charge

255
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,330
them so you couldn't link keep it

256
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:47,040
in your house yeah forever but then

257
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,440
also in this documentary series

258
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,370
is on netflix

259
00:08:51,747 --> 00:08:53,580

260
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,840

261
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,180

so the reason why you get sick

366
00:12:25,675 --> 00:12:27,655
is because your you need to be

it always comes down to well what

521
00:17:55,585 --> 00:17:57,625
would our lives be what we're doing

522
00:17:57,625 --> 00:17:59,455

00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:12,055
they're like they're together and that's her

556
00:19:12,055 --> 00:19:13,555
happy ending right and i'm thinking like

557
00:19:13,555 --> 00:19:14,965
wow he left the show three years

558
00:19:14,965 --> 00:19:16,825
earlier and he bought this awesome house

559
00:19:17,215 --> 00:19:19,075
on the water and so i like

560
00:19:19,075 --> 00:19:20,455
sometimes i think about that like oh

561
00:19:20,455 --> 00:19:23,635
goody character yeah yeah yeah he didn't

562
00:19:23,635 --> 00:19:25,375

00:19:25,435 --> 00:19:27,055
yeah he left the hospital he retired

564
00:19:27,055 --> 00:19:28,795
or whatever embodies bought a great house

565
00:19:28,795 --> 00:19:31,555
up there he wait his character retired

566
00:19:31,585 --> 00:19:32,995

568
00:19:34,825 --> 00:19:36,415

569
00:19:36,415 --> 00:19:39,625
different hospital who knows what weird like

570
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:44,665
such such a soft exit i watched

571
00:19:44,755 --> 00:19:45,475
every episode

572
00:19:45,655 --> 00:19:48,145
retiring i don't remember any details of

573
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:49,735
it well it's good to keep bringing

574
00:19:49,735 --> 00:19:50,935
the shit up all i remember is

575
00:19:50,935 --> 00:19:52,692
the house i remember that house and

576
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:54,295
i remember the goonies house at the

577
00:19:54,295 --> 00:19:58,015
beginning of goonies up in portland ah

578
00:19:58,285 --> 00:19:59,995
and as being two places where i

579
00:19:59,995 --> 00:20:01,075
was like oh man it would be

580
00:20:01,075 --> 00:20:02,485
so cool to live over there like

581
00:20:02,485 --> 00:20:05,274
on the water yeah and but what

582
00:20:05,274 --> 00:20:05,485
did it

583
00:20:06,495 --> 00:20:08,385
yeah i did ultimately it would be

584
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:09,675
it would be nice but i would

585
00:20:09,675 --> 00:20:12,255
probably get kind of stir crazy yeah

586
00:20:12,285 --> 00:20:13,875
oh i like i like hanging out

587
00:20:13,875 --> 00:20:15,285

588
00:20:15,285 --> 00:20:16,695

00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:25,155
these boring netflix documentaries

594
00:20:27,015 --> 00:20:28,395
whatever man i don't know why you

595
00:20:28,395 --> 00:20:30,285

596
00:20:30,285 --> 00:20:34,035
so furious your veins were popping like

597
00:20:34,035 --> 00:20:36,435
crazy but i think i think at

598
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:37,755
that point like i don't know i'm

599
00:20:37,755 --> 00:20:39,615
sixty i'm seventy god i don't think

600

know that far

603
00:20:47,235 --> 00:20:49,215
but like being know i know but

604
00:20:49,215 --> 00:20:50,985
at that point like the works dried

605
00:20:50,985 --> 00:20:51,375
up

606
00:20:52,845 --> 00:20:55,455

whatever i do i don't know i

612
00:21:03,405 --> 00:21:05,325

613
00:21:05,325 --> 00:21:08,085
in terms of retirement yeah like if

614
00:21:08,085 --> 00:21:09,255
i were but then i can't even

615
00:21:09,255 --> 00:21:10,665
imagine retiring but i don't know i

616
00:21:10,695 --> 00:21:11,925
yeah i kind of think like i

617
00:21:11,925 --> 00:21:12,615
know so i know

618
00:21:12,615 --> 00:21:14,655
no my friend's grandparents live in new

00:21:14,655 --> 00:21:17,175
york city and soho with friends well

620
00:21:17,175 --> 00:21:18,705
you don't know that described them to

621
00:21:18,705 --> 00:21:21,105
me judy it's worthless what's a judge

622
00:21:21,135 --> 00:21:23,745
judy though but no it's entergy but

623
00:21:23,745 --> 00:21:26,535
these people her contemporaries um know they're

624
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:29,625
in there bernie sanders they graduated grandparents

625
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:31,005
in their eighties who live in a

626
00:21:31,035 --> 00:21:32,679
five story walk-up

627
00:21:32,775 --> 00:21:33,825
like on the fifth floor walk-up i

628
00:21:33,825 --> 00:21:36,225
mean ah in a in soho like

629
00:21:36,435 --> 00:21:37,553
and they walk up the stairs every

630
00:21:37,603 --> 00:21:38,715
and like they they like have this

631
00:21:38,715 --> 00:21:41,205
like active lifestyle where they walk up

632
00:21:41,445 --> 00:21:42,345
well they have to walk a five

633
00:21:42,345 --> 00:21:44,475
stars aligned by a loner in pairs

634
00:21:45,195 --> 00:21:47,385
they probably take each step by step

635
00:21:47,385 --> 00:21:48,105
you mean or do you mean they

636
00:21:48,105 --> 00:21:49,515
walked together up i'm in or they

637
00:21:49,545 --> 00:21:50,085
think he's

638
00:21:52,275 --> 00:21:54,345
okay yeah there's links for legs who

639
00:21:54,345 --> 00:21:56,085
are these big flunkies with googly eyes

640
00:21:56,385 --> 00:21:57,165
and i love this

641
00:22:00,495 --> 00:22:01,755
but my point is i want to

642
00:22:01,755 --> 00:22:03,675
think about being older like the idea

643
00:22:03,675 --> 00:22:06,105
of that sounds cooler to me than

644
00:22:06,105 --> 00:22:09,315
being like in some quiet slake view

645
00:22:09,345 --> 00:22:10,635
place like i think i'm like oh

646
00:22:10,635 --> 00:22:11,625
i think i would rather be like

647
00:22:11,895 --> 00:22:14,445
outliving in the environment with all these

648
00:22:14,445 --> 00:22:17,085
vicarious move to the middle of nowhere

649
00:22:17,115 --> 00:22:18,375
in their retirement and

650
00:22:18,375 --> 00:22:19,425
and it came with a lot of

651
00:22:19,425 --> 00:22:21,855
stuff that neither of them thought of

652
00:22:21,885 --> 00:22:25,155
like what so they moved ah to

653
00:22:25,335 --> 00:22:27,855
a very remote town in arizona and

654
00:22:27,855 --> 00:22:31,395
so like things like being able to

655
00:22:31,395 --> 00:22:34,245
buy fresh groceries they never thought of

656
00:22:35,415 --> 00:22:37,245
all the groceries were like three days

657
00:22:37,245 --> 00:22:39,825
older than they had here you know

658
00:22:39,855 --> 00:22:41,204
i'm freaking like all the vegetables and

659
00:22:41,204 --> 00:22:43,211
stuff as root i guess no but

660
00:22:43,305 --> 00:22:44,715
that i would not have thought of

661
00:22:44,715 --> 00:22:48,885
that either the ah the the hospitals

662
00:22:48,915 --> 00:22:50,955
like if if anything seriously three days

663
00:22:50,955 --> 00:22:53,355
older yeah if anything seriously in the

664
00:22:53,355 --> 00:22:55,575
blood anything seriously wrong happy

665
00:22:55,575 --> 00:22:56,715
and to them they would have had

666
00:22:56,715 --> 00:22:58,065
to have been airlifted out on a

667
00:22:58,335 --> 00:23:01,695
jesus christ drama yeah so an easy

668
00:23:01,695 --> 00:23:03,585
way for old people yeah but like

669
00:23:03,585 --> 00:23:05,085
it's something that when you when they

670
00:23:05,085 --> 00:23:07,365
both retired ah i forget what age

671
00:23:07,395 --> 00:23:08,805
you know sixty or whatever it's like

672
00:23:08,835 --> 00:23:10,035
oh it sounds so great let's move

673
00:23:10,035 --> 00:23:11,115
to the middle of nowhere and then

674
00:23:11,115 --> 00:23:12,405
you get to be seventy it's like

675
00:23:12,495 --> 00:23:15,735
oh yeah um but

676
00:23:15,765 --> 00:23:17,145
yeah i remember my mom who loved

677
00:23:17,145 --> 00:23:19,485
to cook was just like nothing the

678
00:23:19,665 --> 00:23:20,595
part of the other thing was the

679
00:23:20,595 --> 00:23:22,245
altitude there she's like nothing stays hot

680
00:23:22,245 --> 00:23:24,885
here like of i will cook it

681
00:23:25,065 --> 00:23:26,955
and within three minutes it is cold

682
00:23:28,215 --> 00:23:30,975

683
00:23:30,975 --> 00:23:32,985

but his grandparents because they're old enough

688
00:23:42,255 --> 00:23:44,385
to be grandparents at this point probably

689
00:23:44,775 --> 00:23:47,758
probably probably by the way speaking of

690
00:23:47,925 --> 00:23:48,375

928
00:32:01,610 --> 00:32:02,960
you've been out of school so long

929
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:05,150
how would you even know it's ironic

930
00:32:05,210 --> 00:32:07,010
when you say you made it did

931
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:07,940
you make it by hand or you

932
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:09,410

933
00:32:09,410 --> 00:32:10,970

a little iron on it and then

939
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:19,010

940
00:32:19,610 --> 00:32:22,970
oh yeah so by the way speaking

941
00:32:22,970 --> 00:32:26,120

this on this and maybe that's why

1196
00:41:23,985 --> 00:41:25,785
it's somewhere in your brain i had

1197
00:41:25,785 --> 00:41:27,975
the idea to do a star wars

1198
00:41:28,005 --> 00:41:29,685
podcast where i watch each one and

1199
00:41:29,685 --> 00:41:31,095

00:41:38,805 --> 00:41:39,915
you already had the idea to do

1205
00:41:39,915 --> 00:41:40,275
so

1206
00:41:40,335 --> 00:41:41,775

1210
00:41:46,755 --> 00:41:48,525
if you take everything you know about

1211
00:41:48,525 --> 00:41:50,445
it like yeah darth vader's his father

1212
00:41:51,015 --> 00:41:53,535
and they have lightsabers yeah love is

1213
00:41:53,535 --> 00:41:54,795

1218
00:42:00,765 --> 00:42:03,525
i don't want to spend twenty plus

1219
00:42:03,525 --> 00:42:05,685
hours that's how i felt about the

1220
00:42:05,685 --> 00:42:06,855
lord of the rings like i felt

1221
00:42:06,855 --> 00:42:08,235
like it was such a con coming

1222
00:42:08,235 --> 00:42:09,975
out of that like really i spent

1223
00:42:10,005 --> 00:42:12,855
ten hours of my precious life i

1224
00:42:13,005 --> 00:42:16,005
see is ah god you gollum

1225
00:42:18,105 --> 00:42:19,515

lord of the rings i didn't feel

1227
00:42:20,325 --> 00:42:22,365
that way about the hobbit which i

1228
00:42:22,605 --> 00:42:23,775
i wouldn't even do it i was

1229
00:42:23,775 --> 00:42:25,185
excited to go to the hobbies because

00:42:25,215 --> 00:42:27,465
in the same realm it is middle

1231
00:42:27,465 --> 00:42:30,945
earth but the the books are dramatically

1232
00:42:30,975 --> 00:42:32,625
i would say dramatically different the hobbit

1233
00:42:32,625 --> 00:42:34,755
is a much my lord is the

1234
00:42:34,815 --> 00:42:36,800

00:42:37,965 --> 00:42:39,225
oh yeah that was a weird cartoon

1237
00:42:39,225 --> 00:42:40,995
and then i read the book like

1238
00:42:41,115 --> 00:42:43,575
in preparation for the movies the lord

1239
00:42:43,575 --> 00:42:44,505

1248
00:43:02,655 --> 00:43:04,305

nothing going

1254
00:43:16,335 --> 00:43:18,855
i just had a blank room with

00:43:19,005 --> 00:43:21,974
a blanket with john hodgman and justin

1256
00:43:21,974 --> 00:43:22,215

1257
00:43:23,115 --> 00:43:25,185
when i when i saw the first

1258
00:43:25,275 --> 00:43:26,835
lord of the rings movie i was

1259
00:43:26,835 --> 00:43:28,275
like wow that was okay i guess

1260
00:43:28,275 --> 00:43:29,805
i did an okay job adopting that

1261
00:43:29,985 --> 00:43:30,795
and i thought i would go back

1262
00:43:30,795 --> 00:43:32,655
and reread the books and i couldn't

1263
00:43:32,655 --> 00:43:33,975
do it it was because it was

1264
00:43:33,975 --> 00:43:35,685
too much detail yeah and that's of

1265
00:43:35,685 --> 00:43:38,115
course what people love about these these

1266
00:43:38,115 --> 00:43:40,725
bowling association yeah build a world yeah

1267
00:43:40,785 --> 00:43:42,885

of the

1269
00:43:43,185 --> 00:43:45,345
the movies in that series and then

1270
00:43:45,345 --> 00:43:46,635
when the hobbit came out i was

1271
00:43:46,635 --> 00:43:47,865
very excited to see because i thought

1272
00:43:47,865 --> 00:43:49,425
great this will be a one-off movie

1273
00:43:49,695 --> 00:43:51,675

1275
00:43:52,485 --> 00:43:54,465

a lot like he stole it i

1330
00:45:43,185 --> 00:45:45,225
think that's something else no but they

1331
00:45:45,225 --> 00:45:47,475
caught these calls thing are were stagecoach

1332
00:45:47,505 --> 00:45:49,725
no they called star trek wagon train

1333
00:45:49,725 --> 00:45:52,155
in space no but chevron doesn't

1334
00:45:52,305 --> 00:45:54,045
one thing i know you want to

1335
00:45:54,045 --> 00:45:55,995
show now look at star wars and

1336
00:45:55,995 --> 00:45:59,295
stagecoach agenda now you wanna shove it

1337
00:45:59,535 --> 00:46:02,985
do it ok here's my problem i'm

1338
00:46:02,985 --> 00:46:04,935
saying that the plots are universal it's

1339
00:46:04,935 --> 00:46:07,035
just you don't vote cooter mo down

1340
00:46:07,695 --> 00:46:10,125
the plots slow your work

1341
00:46:11,325 --> 00:46:15,375
paw tattoo a fucking okay yeah the

1342
00:46:15,405 --> 00:46:17,445
star wars movies are based on something

1343
00:46:17,445 --> 00:46:20,625
else well they're like westerns really but

1344
00:46:20,934 --> 00:46:22,575
he based them on these like very

1345
00:46:22,575 --> 00:46:24,733
specific japanese movie there i saw a

1346
00:46:24,733 --> 00:46:28,515
really interesting ah edited together version of

1347
00:46:28,515 --> 00:46:30,285
star wars where they took whatever the

1348
00:46:30,285 --> 00:46:31,185
shot in star was

1349
00:46:31,185 --> 00:46:34,665
ors was they they took like old

1350
00:46:34,665 --> 00:46:36,885
movies whatever whatever like he stole it

1351
00:46:36,885 --> 00:46:39,405
from and they think that is weird

1352
00:46:39,495 --> 00:46:42,225
like every movie is like a collection

1353
00:46:42,225 --> 00:46:43,695
hey but isn't that kind of disappointing

1354
00:46:43,695 --> 00:46:45,375
like like you think of it as

1355
00:46:45,375 --> 00:46:47,565
being like he created this world it's

1356
00:46:47,565 --> 00:46:48,915
like actually it's all based on this

1357
00:46:48,915 --> 00:46:50,685
japanese movie nobody knows but then well

1358
00:46:51,045 --> 00:46:51,315
to be

1359
00:46:51,345 --> 00:46:53,148
millionaire because but i also like that

1360
00:46:53,148 --> 00:46:53,895
he's given a lot of his money

1361
00:46:53,895 --> 00:46:55,065
away and stuff he's a good person

1362
00:46:55,215 --> 00:46:57,825
he yeah he he he built this

1363
00:46:57,825 --> 00:46:59,655
world but it was based on like

1364
00:46:59,655 --> 00:47:01,515
samurai stuff of like that's why you

1365
00:47:01,515 --> 00:47:03,825
know darth vader looks like a kabuki

1366
00:47:04,425 --> 00:47:06,915
kind of figure and yeah the swords

1367
00:47:06,915 --> 00:47:08,208
and all that kind of tree do

1368
00:47:08,208 --> 00:47:09,825
you find a reading on the stage

1369
00:47:09,825 --> 00:47:11,505
coach coach so i'm wrong

1370
00:47:11,505 --> 00:47:13,995
and to have any sort of negative

1371
00:47:14,265 --> 00:47:15,495
oh no no no no you just

1372
00:47:15,495 --> 00:47:18,075
you just googled star wars stagecoach in

1373
00:47:18,075 --> 00:47:18,645
movie

1374
00:47:19,785 --> 00:47:21,405
yeah how's everything going i'm not going

1375
00:47:21,405 --> 00:47:22,785
to get the answer that way but

1376
00:47:22,785 --> 00:47:25,245
i'm saying like you you you've never

1377
00:47:25,245 --> 00:47:26,835

00:47:28,215 --> 00:47:30,405
like but the plots are really seen

1380
00:47:30,405 --> 00:47:31,788
when i'm telling you okay i wonder

all right guys on the person who

1669
01:00:31,285 --> 01:00:32,695
can look inside their hearts it's like

1670
01:00:32,695 --> 01:00:34,405
if someone's racist or not no as

1671
01:00:34,405 --> 01:00:35,545
a racist because you can't look in

1672
01:00:35,545 --> 01:00:38,935
their heart wow yeah i don't agree

1673
01:00:38,935 --> 01:00:40,855
with that even if somebody says incredibly

1674
01:00:40,855 --> 01:00:42,475
racist things you don't know what's in

1675
01:00:42,475 --> 01:00:44,155
there like you're talking about something very

1676
01:00:44,155 --> 01:00:45,505
specific that i don't know what you're

1677
01:00:45,535 --> 01:00:46,735
