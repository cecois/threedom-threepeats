the bullet present this is absurd you

santa is just making random shit yeah

45
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,890
because they're all kids just want the

46
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:39,990
same stuff play stations or whatever wouldn't

47
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:42,600
you horse there were kids who actually

48
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,800
got a piece of coal and that's

49
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,320
it yeah i think i think that's

50
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,480
been done and it's paradise there's a

51
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,310
shitty parents have been around forever i

52
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:51,780
wonder if there's like a jimmy kimmel

53
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,760
prank thing like the halloween thing where

54
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:56,490
like someone unwrapped gifts and it was

55
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:57,660
just a lump of coal and they

56
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:59,730
said what's this those videos with kids

57
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:01,410
make me feel weird because the kids

58
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:04,020
are like that's okay i love you

59
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,060
yeah i would never have i don't

60
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,310
know what videos you're talking about jimmy

61
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:09,480
kimmel will guess yes

62
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:16,620
fair enough alright so it's like either

63
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:18,000
way like three of them i'm scott

64
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:18,450
i'm paul

65
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:19,320
hi

66
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:22,740
if you can't deduce it from there

67
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,510
if you haven't okay here hear the

68
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:26,490

auto detect business

70
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:31,590
i think someone's turning this on having

71
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:33,330
no idea what's going every episode of

72
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:34,950
someone's first alright i'm lauren

73
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:39,660
i think that from the context clues

74
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,610
that have been given that jimmy kim

75
00:02:41,612 --> 00:02:44,850

76
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:46,890
adult gives a child a gift and

77
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:49,170
the gift is intentionally shitty and then

78
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:51,480
the child has to reassure the adult

79
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,270
no no but you're not not too

80
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:56,040

and they're in a large large room

465
00:16:02,735 --> 00:16:05,465
like a box without any like sound

466
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:07,085
dampening stuff and they're supposedly on the

467
00:16:07,085 --> 00:16:09,395
radio and they're like old family friends

468
00:16:09,395 --> 00:16:10,745
as i would yeah and then they

469
00:16:10,745 --> 00:16:12,905
basically decide they both have a boyfriend

470
00:16:12,905 --> 00:16:14,765

471
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:16,715

thing to like get the syndication thing

or something oh yeah and then they

475
00:16:23,585 --> 00:16:25,355
they both get broken up with and

476
00:16:25,355 --> 00:16:26,885
then they realize okay fine let's just

477
00:16:26,915 --> 00:16:29,225
pretend we're together and then they really

478
00:16:29,225 --> 00:16:31,685
have feelings for guy and that and

479
00:16:31,685 --> 00:16:33,905
the fam i mean the movie is

480
00:16:33,935 --> 00:16:36,185
i mean fascinating i romantic comedies is

481
00:16:36,185 --> 00:16:36,875
like the stakes

482
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:38,735
of other movies are like oh is

483
00:16:38,735 --> 00:16:40,025
the earth going to be blown up

484
00:16:40,025 --> 00:16:41,945
by an asteroid and then romantic comedies

485
00:16:41,945 --> 00:16:44,945
are basically like are these two people

486
00:16:44,945 --> 00:16:46,595
out of the billions of people going

487
00:16:46,595 --> 00:16:48,545
to kiss and the answer is yes

488
00:16:48,545 --> 00:16:50,975
because it's a romantic comedy if they

489
00:16:51,005 --> 00:16:52,805
give should be well i like it

490
00:16:52,888 --> 00:16:54,905
i think romantic shakes of a romantic

491
00:16:54,905 --> 00:16:56,906
comedy would we're like okay

492
00:16:57,035 --> 00:16:58,085
how many people are in the world

493
00:16:58,115 --> 00:17:00,121
eight billion something like that if a

494
00:17:00,121 --> 00:17:03,335
hundreds if four billion people were in

495
00:17:03,337 --> 00:17:04,985
kiss the other four billion people at

496
00:17:04,985 --> 00:17:06,815
the same time then the stakes are

497
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:09,125
like you it'll be really weird that's

498
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:11,195
an interesting premise for a movie but

499
00:17:11,195 --> 00:17:13,685
why i don't think that's changing is

500
00:17:13,685 --> 00:17:16,010
more interesting than people kissing her nah

501
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:16,895
hey tattoo

502
00:17:17,195 --> 00:17:19,025
i have to divide the population and

503
00:17:19,655 --> 00:17:22,055
give the kissy just the same size

504
00:17:23,795 --> 00:17:26,015
for charity the thing that bugs me

505
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:29,975
about romantic comedies is the that the

506
00:17:30,695 --> 00:17:31,835
what is it the third act where

507
00:17:31,835 --> 00:17:32,975
they have to be a part for

508
00:17:32,975 --> 00:17:34,505
summary yeah where there's a finally get

509
00:17:34,505 --> 00:17:36,905
to where there's misunderstanding and then yeah

510
00:17:36,905 --> 00:17:38,675
it's like you lie to me yeah

511
00:17:38,675 --> 00:17:40,205
and then they're mad for a week

512
00:17:40,205 --> 00:17:41,375
or whatever and then and then the

513
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:43,205
person catches up with them yeah i'm

514
00:17:43,205 --> 00:17:43,355
sa

515
00:17:43,355 --> 00:17:44,525
sorry i lied i did it because

516
00:17:44,525 --> 00:17:45,845
i like you too much wow what

517
00:17:45,845 --> 00:17:47,315
does that do you as as a

518
00:17:47,315 --> 00:17:49,115
fan of rom-coms do you like that

519
00:17:49,115 --> 00:17:51,605
part is that satisfying to have that

520
00:17:51,605 --> 00:17:53,975
included i think it ok for f

521
00:17:53,975 --> 00:17:55,115
i'm thinking of like a great one

522
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:57,335
like you've got mail which i just

523
00:17:57,335 --> 00:18:01,145
rewatched um it's great because they they

524
00:18:01,145 --> 00:18:03,485
get there's the anger there's

525
00:18:03,545 --> 00:18:06,485
the upset there's everything and then the

526
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:07,985
reveal and that one's really good because

527
00:18:07,985 --> 00:18:09,545
she still doesn't know that the person

528
00:18:09,545 --> 00:18:10,535
she's been ran into was him the

529
00:18:10,535 --> 00:18:11,735
whole time she's mad at him and

530
00:18:11,735 --> 00:18:13,415
the whole thing but then it's him

531
00:18:13,415 --> 00:18:15,365
and she's like i'm glad it's him

532
00:18:15,605 --> 00:18:17,495
and it's this that's a really i

533
00:18:17,495 --> 00:18:19,205
find it unbelievable to tom hanks would

534
00:18:19,205 --> 00:18:20,855
be friends with dave chappelle that is

535
00:18:20,855 --> 00:18:21,395
unbelievable

536
00:18:22,025 --> 00:18:23,195
you know that's the worst part of

537
00:18:23,195 --> 00:18:24,605
that movie isn't there a treadmill in

538
00:18:24,605 --> 00:18:26,585
that movie yeah they're on it yeah

539
00:18:26,615 --> 00:18:28,415
just don't buy a treadmill and they

540
00:18:28,415 --> 00:18:29,645
talk to each other on a treadmill

541
00:18:29,675 --> 00:18:31,505
i just don't buy it so you

542
00:18:31,565 --> 00:18:33,005
don't think that they would be friends

543
00:18:33,005 --> 00:18:34,835
and i don't think that they would

544
00:18:34,835 --> 00:18:36,935
be on treadmills well i think they

545
00:18:36,935 --> 00:18:37,835
weren't together

546
00:18:39,095 --> 00:18:40,325
so it's it makes it a little

547
00:18:40,325 --> 00:18:41,225
less random

548
00:18:42,545 --> 00:18:44,975
random so i buy this halloween mask

549
00:18:45,005 --> 00:18:47,195

i've had a jacuzzi party yesterday with

868
00:30:06,905 --> 00:30:09,425
two other deja vu all wearing masks

869
00:30:09,425 --> 00:30:12,455
the entire time and a jacuzzi yeah

870
00:30:12,485 --> 00:30:15,215
you know about that feels hot the

871
00:30:15,215 --> 00:30:17,435
mask part of the jacuzzi the jacuzzi

872
00:30:17,915 --> 00:30:20,646
huh well that's how you get into

873
00:30:20,646 --> 00:30:21,185
a temperature you

874
00:30:21,215 --> 00:30:22,651
like and that's usually how to choose

875
00:30:22,655 --> 00:30:24,905
and i just feel like i have

876
00:30:24,965 --> 00:30:26,135
a sort of i'm in this mindset

877
00:30:26,135 --> 00:30:27,665
of like i wanna just wait for

878
00:30:27,665 --> 00:30:30,905
everything to be fine yeah sounds depressing

879
00:30:30,905 --> 00:30:33,095
maybe wow am i doing enough things

880
00:30:33,095 --> 00:30:35,795
that yeah oh and and even just

881
00:30:35,795 --> 00:30:37,145
i went back to work last week

882
00:30:37,145 --> 00:30:37,835
which by the way it was like

883
00:30:38,315 --> 00:30:41,345
extremely draining um because i was working

884
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:44,760
and it was just like is a

885
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,620
whole thing with the protocol the covert

886
00:30:46,650 --> 00:30:48,210
protocol on a set we talked about

887
00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:49,980
it on our first we have talked

888
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:51,568
about it but i hadn't experienced it

889
00:30:51,568 --> 00:30:53,490
yet and i found that it was

890
00:30:53,490 --> 00:30:56,550
very exhausting and a different way than

891
00:30:56,550 --> 00:30:58,920
it typically is and i just felt

892
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,210
like kind of just want everything to

893
00:31:00,210 --> 00:31:01,710
be fucking normal

894
00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:04,890
and well to a point of which

895
00:31:04,890 --> 00:31:06,480
i've been at every month and every

896
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,010
day but like it's just reaching like

897
00:31:08,010 --> 00:31:09,360
another point of like oh my god

898
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,370
i just want this i do feel

899
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:13,380
like even if there's a vaccine even

900
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:14,970
if that the vaccine come soon and

901
00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:17,580
everything works out i still feel like

902
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:18,600
i will wear a mask on a

903
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:21,180
plane well i feel like no situational

904
00:31:21,210 --> 00:31:22,170
people were saying like

905
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,450
you know lauren you know this when

906
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:26,828
you go to japan good lauren oh

907
00:31:26,828 --> 00:31:29,550
no this everyone like western jail somewhere

908
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:32,280
a mass probably half the people on

909
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:34,830
every subways yeah masks right yeah and

910
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:37,710
like that they think that we'll get

911
00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:39,600
there in the united states of like

912
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:41,700
okay yeah even if a vaccine is

913
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:42,420
ninety percent

914
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,730
effective still like why don't we now

915
00:31:44,730 --> 00:31:46,770
that we've normalized masks why don't you

916
00:31:46,770 --> 00:31:47,850
why don't we wear them when we're

917
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,040
absolutely worked on me like i used

918
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:51,750
to see when i would see people

919
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:53,910
that were wearing masks i didn't quite

920
00:31:54,150 --> 00:31:55,800
before all this happened i was like

921
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,750
i don't quite get that yeah why

922
00:31:57,750 --> 00:32:00,720

931
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:16,830

all intrigued like what's behind that mask

937
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:27,270
and she got famous because she was

938
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:29,610
run over face yes from the front

939
00:32:29,610 --> 00:32:30,270
half of her head

940
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:33,900
and she became famous for that and

941
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:35,100

eighty two issues so i saw

1017
00:35:23,070 --> 00:35:24,810
i might my father occasionally would do

1018
00:35:24,810 --> 00:35:26,760
something where he'd be like stop watching

1019
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,560
happy days or whatever turn on something

1020
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,270
good and i remember once was mutiny

1021
00:35:30,270 --> 00:35:31,860
on the bounty and each time i

1022
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:33,510
liked it each time like i liked

1023
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:35,460
when i returned it on but i

1024
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:36,990

instead and and nicholas nickleby was on

1026
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,410

00:35:40,410 --> 00:35:43,200
like twenty minutes later whatever

1028
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:46,680
her and was immediately enraptured and deny

1029
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:49,110
her inheritance and did not realize it

1030
00:35:49,110 --> 00:35:51,840
was an eight hours it's life like

1031
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,820
when you go into nicholas nickleby not

1032
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:55,290
knowing how long it is it's like

1033
00:35:55,290 --> 00:35:56,551

1034
00:35:56,551 --> 00:35:57,840

1035
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:01,200

1036
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:03,360

1037
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:05,160
zinc will be on tv when it

1038
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:06,570
when they put it on tv and

1039
00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:08,010
when pbx put it on and i've

1040
00:36:08,010 --> 00:36:09,420
loved it ever since and then i

1041
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:12,360
bought a i bought it on disc

1042
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:16,800
four disc set in the late nineties

1043
00:36:16,830 --> 00:36:20,250
or something wow and then of a

1044
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:22,980
few years ago i started this

1045
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:25,110
i know it was not meant to

1046
00:36:25,110 --> 00:36:26,310
be a tradition but it became a

1047
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:29,160
tradition where i said i'm going to

1048
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:30,810
watch this this is gonna be a

1049
00:36:30,810 --> 00:36:32,821
whole day and i invited a couple

1050
00:36:32,821 --> 00:36:34,320
of people over that i thought would

1051
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,910
be that this would be up their

1052
00:36:35,910 --> 00:36:39,210
alley and it turns out it was

1053
00:36:39,210 --> 00:36:40,260
not up the alley of all of

1054
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:41,520
them there were only two people that

1055
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,680
stayed and so then we

1056
00:36:43,947 --> 00:36:46,080
stay the whole time did we know

1057
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,220
that but you are not the first

1058
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:49,470
year okay then so i would try

1059
00:36:49,470 --> 00:36:51,630
different people there were there were two

1060
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:53,310
people that went ev that would go

1061
00:36:53,310 --> 00:36:54,900
every year and watch the entire thing

1062
00:36:55,110 --> 00:36:56,999
which to me was weird because in

1063
00:36:56,999 --> 00:36:59,115
my mind i was like well i

1064
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:00,270
would i don't i'm not opposed to

1065
00:37:00,270 --> 00:37:01,290
doing this every year but i would

1066
00:37:01,290 --> 00:37:03,180
imagine it would be new people right

1067
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:03,836
yeah do

1068
00:37:03,870 --> 00:37:07,560
it um because why i it never

1069
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:08,520
occurred to me that there would be

1070
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:09,720
other people who would want to watch

1071
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:12,300
it in it's entirety every year right

1072
00:37:12,570 --> 00:37:14,370
so you thought people would come and

1073
00:37:14,370 --> 00:37:16,590
go or it'd be different people every

1074
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:18,330
single year they're just different people but

1075
00:37:18,330 --> 00:37:19,740
they watch the whole thing yeah they

1076
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:21,030
watched her we'd spend the day together

1077
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:22,530
like i said this is what we're

1078
00:37:22,530 --> 00:37:23,790
doing this is what it is or

1079
00:37:23,790 --> 00:37:24,000
was

1080
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:24,960
in the entire thing from start to

1081
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,880
finish we're not saying we're not really

1082
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:29,610
taking breaks like image will have food

1083
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:32,010
in between the the discs you can

1084
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,720
you know well i've obviously you can

1085
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:35,250
get up and get something while it's

1086
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:36,900
happening you can only get up when

1087
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:37,890
the disc changes

1088
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:41,310
yeah go to the bathroom hold it

1089
00:37:41,370 --> 00:37:42,510
look this is my idea of fun

1090
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:43,740
it has a lot of strict rules

1091
00:37:45,210 --> 00:37:48,450
um and so yeah so i've been

1092
00:37:48,450 --> 00:37:50,970
doing it for i think five years

1093
00:37:50,970 --> 00:37:53,370
now something like that ah and it's

1094
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:56,010
it's really i love it this year

1095
00:37:56,010 --> 00:37:57,660
it'll just be this year i don't

1096
00:37:57,660 --> 00:37:58,380
know if i'm going to do it

1097
00:37:58,380 --> 00:37:59,340
because it would just be me and

1098
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:02,220
janie yeah so i don't know if

1099
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:04,020
it really and how does cheney feel

1100
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:05,010
about it each year

1101
00:38:05,070 --> 00:38:07,260
she likes it she always she falls

1102
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:09,060
asleep in a different part each year

1250
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:21,230
the hallmark channel and like you know

1251
00:43:21,230 --> 00:43:23,180

hallmark movies on netflix yeah and i

1259
00:43:37,850 --> 00:43:39,440

they're making them for two dollars yeah

1261
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:43,430

1794
01:03:48,110 --> 01:03:49,310

1795
01:03:49,550 --> 01:03:51,290

pulled them in every direction wow the

1799
01:03:55,820 --> 01:03:57,680
next step is poignantly breaks and seeing

1800
01:03:57,680 --> 01:03:59,750
what's inside here's our step was we

1801
01:03:59,750 --> 01:04:02,060
thrown out the window so he would

1802
01:04:02,060 --> 01:04:03,290
land in the snow and make a

1803
01:04:03,290 --> 01:04:04,730
whole like a cartoon that's fun and

1804
01:04:04,730 --> 01:04:06,560
he did and then we forgot about

1805
01:04:06,560 --> 01:04:08,090
him and then when we discovered him

1806
01:04:08,090 --> 01:04:09,650

1896
01:07:00,770 --> 01:07:01,820
