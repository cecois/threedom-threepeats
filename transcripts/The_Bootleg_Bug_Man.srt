tied up in a belt

152
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:42,870
much like samantha partington

153
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:46,710
over the american girls she had a

154
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:47,940
thing to carry her books that there

155
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:48,960
wasn't a belt but it was two

156
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:50,670
things with like a strap yeah so

157
00:05:50,671 --> 00:05:52,110
it was like a strip of wooden

158
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:54,899
beam on the top o buckles of

159
00:05:54,899 --> 00:05:57,390
round and you'd slide the box like

160
00:05:57,390 --> 00:06:00,240
a pilgrim's hat pilgrim's hat do you

161
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,590
do we talk about this before like

162
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:02,970
when you were fucking kid you had

163
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:03,810
to carry around a

164
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:06,390
bunch of goddamn books on your baddies

165
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:08,468
yeah bags ever and then go with

166
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:10,111
some people were as low slung because

167
00:06:10,111 --> 00:06:11,400
i was cool at the time yes

168
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,170
and then and not hinder your walk

169
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:14,040
and then we had to put them

170
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,540
in our bathroom lockers we weren't allowed

171
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:17,310
to carry backpacks all day exactly we

172
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:18,540

173
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,640
carry a safeguard and move along i

174
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,350
would carry a stack of books because

175
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:23,970
every class expected you to have your

176
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,530
book with you your textbook with you

177
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,370
but i never wanted to go to

178
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:28,230
the locker because my locker was filled

179
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:30,930
with whatever shit in papers and stuff

180
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:32,250

181
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:33,240
of weeks and they never went to

182
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,070
a taped up on there exactly but

183
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:37,140
once again my locker was my pride

184
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:38,430
and joy i loved going to my

185
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:40,500
locker yeah and i loved organizing it

186
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,970
and also all my classes were all

187
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:43,230
over the place so it was like

188

sounds familiar by nine noon um ok

234
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:14,940
we had to do bug collections in

235
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:18,000
had to got to in science class

236
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:20,190
in junior high know that for i

237
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:21,870
call bullshit on that you bring me

238
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:23,370

00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:33,630
had to collect right and you had

246
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:36,480
to pin them into styrofoam and identify

247
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,860

net and go and go find them

252
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,290
places right and and they go hey

253
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:47,670
there's a park across the street with

254
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:48,000
a pa

255
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,440

00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:52,890
like yeah this is comp this is

258
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:54,660

so hung over right okay guys i

260
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:58,890
don't think it's going election i mean

261
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:00,690
we dissected frogs and we know we

262
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:03,360
expected from glam so other people's insects

263
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,370
baby frogs and eighty pigs but so

264
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:06,720
the bottle is sick when you think

265
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,160
about it so the bug collection thing

266
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,020
king yeah and some probably horrific i

267
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:10,860
mean i thought it was gross but

268
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,240
i didn't think it was like inhumane

269
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,260
but i didn't want to do think

270
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:14,880
it's bad now so the vogue collection

271
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:16,290
i went out with a with a

272
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:17,970
net a butterfly net or whatever and

273
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:19,110
try to hold on a second yeah

274
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:20,490
were you provided the nets are you

275
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:21,570
had to get the net buyers think

276
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:22,290
you had to get the net by

277
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:25,830
fucking garbage terrible because my horse i

278
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:27,420
went out one day to the park

279
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:28,290
and swung around

280
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,090
the neck the net just going i'm

281
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:33,060
trying to get a book and oh

282
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,700
i can get okay okay when people

283
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,960
talk about where you believe they would

284
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,940
do with the time machine i would

285
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:40,710
go watch this

286
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:46,560
in a here let's go fucking with

287
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,990
some net that would change the course

288
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:50,910
of the future forever if we want

289
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:52,560
yeah the talk about the butterfly i

290
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:53,730
never talked i was gonna say it's

291
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:56,130
not okay not catching a butterfly effect

292
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,640
so what can you do better for

293
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,930
them so you get you get like

294
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:03,150
three months to do this right you

295
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:05,730
know i fucking hopes yeah yeah so

296
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:06,840
there's it's not like he's saying hey

297
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,640
do this tonight the rest of your

298
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,400
academic legs that you find well you're

299
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,530
certain no you're supposed to find certain

300
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:15,360
bugs and be able to identify that

301
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,520
is so rude obviously not

302
00:10:18,155 --> 00:10:19,325
cause if you kill one you go

303
00:10:19,325 --> 00:10:21,545
to jail yeah you can he can

304
00:10:21,575 --> 00:10:22,805
it goes to hell because it's in

305
00:10:22,805 --> 00:10:24,935
the middle of asking forgiveness for instance

306
00:10:25,325 --> 00:10:28,115
interrupts some baptize so you don't know

307
00:10:28,655 --> 00:10:30,995
so basically like the clock is ticking

308
00:10:30,995 --> 00:10:33,545
down on this three months right and

309
00:10:33,545 --> 00:10:34,955
it's getting closer and the first couple

310
00:10:34,955 --> 00:10:35,975
of months you're like yeah at some

311
00:10:35,975 --> 00:10:36,995
point i'm going to try to get

312
00:10:36,995 --> 00:10:38,250
these bugs or whatever yeah this

313
00:10:38,285 --> 00:10:40,745
is doable month in it's like yea

314
00:10:40,745 --> 00:10:42,245
i gotta get these bugs but i

315
00:10:42,245 --> 00:10:44,645
can still do it right i mean

316
00:10:44,645 --> 00:10:45,725
it's gonna come down to the wire

317
00:10:46,115 --> 00:10:48,125
and then the week of you have

318
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:49,925
no bugs in your life this is

319
00:10:49,925 --> 00:10:52,115
how oh boy it was in biology

320
00:10:52,115 --> 00:10:54,215
classmate was my software euro is actually

321
00:10:54,215 --> 00:10:55,955

322
00:10:55,955 --> 00:10:56,945
it freshmen cause i really don't want

323
00:10:56,945 --> 00:10:57,665
to do and then i was a

freshmen what was kind of fun and

326
00:10:59,795 --> 00:11:01,625
there were two other sophomores and we

327
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:03,335
had to do a project where we

328
00:11:03,365 --> 00:11:05,045
i know where we had to like

329
00:11:05,045 --> 00:11:06,545

whole semester and like go to a

331
00:11:08,495 --> 00:11:11,375
scientific internship of some they wanted people

332
00:11:11,405 --> 00:11:12,695
to do this or they or you

333
00:11:12,695 --> 00:11:13,805

figure out all out yourself and so

337
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:18,515

723
00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:26,150
science in my final year i feel

724
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:28,460
like i'm having the craziest mind melt

725
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:30,080

739
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:56,720
in the metallica fan yeah but you're

871
00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:28,220

872
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:30,050

881
00:29:45,770 --> 00:29:47,692
separately this teacher who was cast to

882
00:29:47,692 --> 00:29:49,369
the play also made out with a

883
00:29:49,369 --> 00:29:51,110
student did not have any did not

884
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:53,720

886
00:29:56,270 --> 00:29:57,528
the person who ran off with the

887
00:29:57,528 --> 00:29:59,720
students they stay together i don't know

888
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:00,890
i don't know what happened to them

889
00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:03,650
but that english teacher he gave me

890
00:30:03,650 --> 00:30:04,070
a bad

891
00:30:04,130 --> 00:30:06,260
grade on my paper about black like

892
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:08,030
me because he said you didn't prove

893
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:09,290
to me that you read the book

894
00:30:09,410 --> 00:30:10,970
what was what's allowed wonder what you

895
00:30:10,970 --> 00:30:12,980

896
00:30:13,010 --> 00:30:14,240
copy the back of the book you're

897
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:16,490

899
00:30:18,711 --> 00:30:20,030
put penguin books in there that i

900
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:23,303

901
00:30:23,303 --> 00:30:24,290
what black like me is no

902
00:30:24,290 --> 00:30:25,850
why did you do you don't i

903
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,290
guess i don't really because i never

904
00:30:27,290 --> 00:30:29,840
read it this was an experiment in

905
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:30,650
the i wanna say it was the

906
00:30:30,650 --> 00:30:33,500
sixties where a white man had his

907
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:36,080
skin um darken because this is like

908
00:30:36,412 --> 00:30:38,030
murphy kind of thing exactly it was

909
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:40,070
yeah what the eddie murphy yeah yeah

910
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:41,870
yeah yeah yeah and so he went

911
00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:43,611
out in the world and and so

912
00:30:43,611 --> 00:30:44,450
what it was like to be treated

913
00:30:45,125 --> 00:30:47,585
yeah right and pretty good it was

914
00:30:47,585 --> 00:30:49,925

915
00:30:50,765 --> 00:30:51,755
like everyone assumed i had a big

916

he had a great time

918
00:30:58,745 --> 00:31:00,695
wasn't there a movie like this concludes

919
00:31:00,695 --> 00:31:01,865
with so i don't know what all

920
00:31:01,865 --> 00:31:02,916
the fuss is about but it was

921
00:31:02,916 --> 00:31:05,615
like a comedy facilities watermelon thomas howell

922
00:31:05,615 --> 00:31:08,315

923
00:31:08,315 --> 00:31:09,725
were like there's there's a lot of

924
00:31:09,755 --> 00:31:11,735

i've talked about this because it's like

967
00:32:26,375 --> 00:32:27,605
well it's like do you want a

968
00:32:27,665 --> 00:32:28,745
you want ryan but

969
00:32:28,844 --> 00:32:31,135
not saying that we know use and

970
00:32:31,145 --> 00:32:32,705
you can say he's playing a woman

971
00:32:32,735 --> 00:32:35,855
yeah but i think marijuana is like

972
00:32:35,855 --> 00:32:38,195
joanna marijuana man no it doesn't make

973
00:32:38,675 --> 00:32:39,515
it soon as much as you want

974
00:32:39,755 --> 00:32:41,585
it's never going to make it a

975
00:32:41,585 --> 00:32:43,235
phrase that we all use hey we're

976
00:32:43,235 --> 00:32:44,675
looking for somebody to play in the

977
00:32:44,675 --> 00:32:46,175
wwe and nba do you want a

978
00:32:46,175 --> 00:32:48,545
man that's the only way that those

979
00:32:48,575 --> 00:32:48,905
those

980
00:32:48,965 --> 00:32:51,035
plays those plays on your work is

981
00:32:51,035 --> 00:32:52,625
if it's like a common expression you

982
00:32:52,625 --> 00:32:54,725
have to just like mrs doubtfire it

983
00:32:54,785 --> 00:32:57,305
is actually er we don't doubtfire no

984
00:32:57,335 --> 00:33:00,065
men men doughy guy fire created by

985
00:33:00,065 --> 00:33:03,365
women doubtfire i always do and are

986
00:33:03,365 --> 00:33:05,885
you missing this doubtfire my mind when

987
00:33:05,885 --> 00:33:07,535
i've discovered that was based on a

988
00:33:07,535 --> 00:33:09,125
book my mind was blown

989
00:33:09,125 --> 00:33:10,475
and apart yeah bible

990
00:33:12,515 --> 00:33:15,785
make a backfire based on chapter chapter

991
00:33:15,785 --> 00:33:18,875
spacer say a young adult novel whoa

992
00:33:18,905 --> 00:33:21,575
yeah yeah yeah yeah that actually may

993
00:33:21,575 --> 00:33:23,735
go without saying that i would say

994
00:33:23,735 --> 00:33:25,205
in a book form you'd be say

995
00:33:25,205 --> 00:33:28,895
it does make young adult novel but

996
00:33:28,895 --> 00:33:30,125
also makes sense that it was written

997
00:33:30,125 --> 00:33:31,055
before because you know it's like such

998
00:33:31,055 --> 00:33:31,685
a great original

999
00:33:31,685 --> 00:33:32,705
idea and it's like no it was

1000
00:33:32,705 --> 00:33:34,715
such a great place but it was

1001
00:33:34,715 --> 00:33:35,975

1006
00:33:44,675 --> 00:33:46,925
to do this yeah do you see

1007
00:33:46,955 --> 00:33:48,739

to live together time like we've have

1124

to live in a small space you

1125
00:38:09,875 --> 00:38:11,765
know an apartment or something together just

1126
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:13,325
deal with each other like that boundary

1127
00:38:13,325 --> 00:38:15,035
celebrities but if it was celebrities i

1128
00:38:15,035 --> 00:38:16,865
would probably have fear factor we watch

1129
00:38:17,075 --> 00:38:20,465
like reese witherspoon anita scorpion so many

1130
00:38:20,465 --> 00:38:22,535
tales fears involves eating a bug i

1131
00:38:22,535 --> 00:38:24,215
know it's wild yet who wants to

1132
00:38:24,785 --> 00:38:26,345
call the bug man of science he's

1133
00:38:26,345 --> 00:38:29,045
gonna chomp into a scorpion to five

1134
00:38:29,045 --> 00:38:30,455
hundred venues i bet he was spitting

1135
00:38:30,455 --> 00:38:31,655
those bugs out right before we got

1136
00:38:31,655 --> 00:38:33,125
there you go i gotta sell some

1137
00:38:33,125 --> 00:38:33,339
of these

1138
00:38:34,835 --> 00:38:36,815
there you are pretty severe don't go

1139
00:38:36,815 --> 00:38:39,185
to paris before of the kids what

1140
00:38:39,185 --> 00:38:39,725
are you guys

1141
00:38:40,955 --> 00:38:42,305
do you have one you watch more

1142
00:38:42,305 --> 00:38:45,245
realities to shy children iyo i tend

1143
00:38:45,245 --> 00:38:46,985
to like ones that are that have

1144
00:38:46,985 --> 00:38:48,815
some sort of competitive things so in

1145
00:38:48,815 --> 00:38:50,525
the competitive category a little more than

1146
00:38:50,525 --> 00:38:52,715
just following people around with fake storylines

1147
00:38:52,775 --> 00:38:56,105
oh okay insulted other than the bachelor

1148
00:38:56,105 --> 00:38:58,025
is fakes but that's kind of competitive

1149
00:38:58,025 --> 00:39:00,575
right there so i think i think

1150
00:39:00,665 --> 00:39:00,875
an

1151
00:39:00,995 --> 00:39:03,125
actual ah season of the bachelor with

1152
00:39:03,125 --> 00:39:06,905
celebrities would be fascinating um where it's

1153
00:39:06,905 --> 00:39:08,765
real where it's real celebrities and they're

1154
00:39:08,765 --> 00:39:11,015
literally looking for love or they're like

1155
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:12,185
hey look this is where we get

1156
00:39:12,185 --> 00:39:14,165
into it like when we were envisioning

1157
00:39:14,165 --> 00:39:16,925
these things when you're saying celebrity yeah

1158
00:39:16,955 --> 00:39:19,385
you mean like real celebrity yeah really

1159
00:39:19,385 --> 00:39:21,125
like whoever they can diet other

1160
00:39:21,125 --> 00:39:23,855
or bachelor contestant yeah right celebrities for

1161
00:39:23,885 --> 00:39:26,105

1164
00:39:30,725 --> 00:39:31,805

to see bachelor with um older people

1166
00:39:33,875 --> 00:39:36,271
who've already maybe been married or they're

1167
00:39:36,725 --> 00:39:38,765
ready to actually be married i think

1168
00:39:38,765 --> 00:39:40,385
that there there would be an interesting

1169
00:39:40,385 --> 00:39:41,195
bachelor season

1170
00:39:41,285 --> 00:39:43,565
if like people who aren't football players

1171
00:39:43,595 --> 00:39:45,425
yeah or cheerleaders i would love to

1172
00:39:45,425 --> 00:39:49,263
see a doctor who's forty five and

00:39:49,263 --> 00:39:51,760

show

1180
00:40:08,105 --> 00:40:08,885
i've always been curious

1181
00:40:10,115 --> 00:40:13,475
ah now i do think that that

1182
00:40:13,985 --> 00:40:16,385
too to watch a show as produced

1183
00:40:16,385 --> 00:40:18,005
as well and with high enough stakes

1184
00:40:18,245 --> 00:40:20,495
of just regular people who don't have

1185
00:40:20,495 --> 00:40:22,415
to work out eight hours a day

1186
00:40:22,415 --> 00:40:24,005
yeah because it would be interesting yeah

1187
00:40:24,065 --> 00:40:26,045
i agree because they it leads to

1188
00:40:26,045 --> 00:40:27,935
boring conversations because they don't have any

1189
00:40:27,935 --> 00:40:30,245
interest besides bus tour eighteen waiting

1190
00:40:30,245 --> 00:40:33,575

i was staring at pawns and scott

1196
00:40:44,165 --> 00:40:47,915
hasn't go go your way you're like

1197
00:40:47,915 --> 00:40:49,835
the your show would be if i

1198
00:40:49,835 --> 00:40:50,405
could make up a show

1199
00:40:51,030 --> 00:40:51,450
launch

1200
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:55,530
it's babies writing dogs that are dressed

1201
00:40:55,530 --> 00:40:56,820
up like men i mean

1202
00:40:57,990 --> 00:41:00,720
yeah but that's almost like one of

1203
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:04,380
those youtube channels of simian virus what's

1204
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:07,200
the baby dressed up like cowboys cow

1205
00:41:07,241 --> 00:41:09,540
wow here's here's cowboys writing men my

1206
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:11,610
ideally ideally to me it would be

1207
00:41:11,610 --> 00:41:13,950
like a fat baby yeah in just

1208
00:41:13,950 --> 00:41:15,720
like the diaper but with a cowboy

1209
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:18,030
hat and boots yeah spurs and the

1210
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:20,070
dog is dressing like an elegant gentleman

1211
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:22,020
oh yeah of course she good that's

1212
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:23,730
good and then they're strapped in and

1213
00:41:23,730 --> 00:41:24,900
what do they do though like what

1214
00:41:24,930 --> 00:41:27,270
what's the narrative i mean there isn't

1215
00:41:27,270 --> 00:41:29,070
one can see rightly is old enough

1216
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:30,450
for whatever yeah they run errands around

1217
00:41:30,450 --> 00:41:32,100
the house they want it that's too

1218
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:33,570
much plot for you i think it's

1219
00:41:33,570 --> 00:41:35,820
a race but obviously it's just a

1220
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:38,280
meandering to get from one point there

1221
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:40,560
no prize there just like this is

1222
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:42,090
a race los actually one of them

1223
00:41:42,090 --> 00:41:43,740
crosses the finish line right yeah but

1224
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,840
it doesn't it's like where they go

1225
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:47,790
you follow them wherever they go yeah

1226
00:41:47,790 --> 00:41:49,530
but really i think it'd be interesting

1227
00:41:49,530 --> 00:41:50,938
to follow a baby if you were

1228
00:41:50,938 --> 00:41:52,710
like you know how parents always protect

1229
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:54,570
a baby from leaving the house and

1230
00:41:54,570 --> 00:41:56,940
barrier you know yeah it's like okay

1231
00:41:56,970 --> 00:41:58,440
put a baby in the pair

1232
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:01,350
aunt's house leave all doors open and

1233
00:42:01,350 --> 00:42:03,720
then does the baby stay it creates

1234
00:42:04,410 --> 00:42:06,446
the baby leaf babies are always trying

1235
00:42:06,446 --> 00:42:08,580
to protect their children yeah but you

1236
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:09,510
know what i mean like hey what

1237
00:42:09,510 --> 00:42:11,085
would what would happen if it what

1238
00:42:11,167 --> 00:42:11,898
i said babies

1239
00:42:13,710 --> 00:42:15,870
babies protecting children what would happen if

1240
00:42:15,870 --> 00:42:17,820
we left all your doors open would

1241
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:19,680
a baby choose to stay there or

1242
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,060
would a baby just take off the

1243
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:22,740
baby and i stay or should i

1244
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:25,770
go janki janki jayson i was i

1245
00:42:25,770 --> 00:42:28,740
don't think there's enough horror competitions of

1246
00:42:28,740 --> 00:42:32,730
like people trying to scare people even

1247
00:42:32,730 --> 00:42:33,360
a scary house

1248
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:36,222
there was like a stranger kids stranger

1249
00:42:36,222 --> 00:42:37,560
straight educating disease see

1250
00:42:40,290 --> 00:42:41,880
oh my god did i didn't mention

1251
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:42,785

00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:44,730
just stay in a haunted house where

1253
00:42:44,730 --> 00:42:46,770
then they have things that are intentionally

1254
00:42:46,770 --> 00:42:48,660
scaring you like someone stepping out of

1255
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:52,290
someone saying boo yeah who can do

1256
00:42:53,430 --> 00:42:55,080

broadcast eventually she was like yes everyone

1303
00:44:43,620 --> 00:44:45,870
listened to the show yeah i think

1304
00:44:45,870 --> 00:44:48,120
the more sincere the better yeah like

1305
00:44:48,150 --> 00:44:50,340
i'm not a huge fan of performative

1306
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:54,780
ah anchor ah marriage proposals i would

1307
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:55,050
see

1308
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:56,910
a few at restaurants i worked at

1309
00:44:56,940 --> 00:44:59,040
and with people applauding and i always

1310
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:00,810
felt it was noxious but that that

1311
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:02,790
that's just me i think there are

1312
00:45:02,790 --> 00:45:05,490
some people who might appreciate the doing

1313
00:45:05,490 --> 00:45:06,870
it in front of like a bunch

1314
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:09,090
of people or family members but for

1315
00:45:09,090 --> 00:45:11,550
me i think the way you ask

1316
00:45:11,550 --> 00:45:13,860
the more sincere the better say what

1317
00:45:13,860 --> 00:45:15,180
is on couldn't disagree more

1318
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:15,810
jumbotron

1319
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:20,519
mary jo johnson throw a ring in

1320
00:45:20,519 --> 00:45:21,450
a jumbotron you're married

1321
00:45:23,610 --> 00:45:23,850
joe job

1322
00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:28,260
i agree that i i think that

1323
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:30,900
a ah a sort of trap that

1324
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:32,490
people fall into is they feel like

1325
00:45:32,490 --> 00:45:34,350
they have to make it special when

1326
00:45:34,350 --> 00:45:37,080
it's already an extremely special thing you

1327
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:38,160
can do some things to make it

1328
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:39,540
special like go to going to a

1329
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:41,040
favorite restaurant or a nice or nice

1330
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:43,110
location or whatever exactly but i think

1331
00:45:43,110 --> 00:45:45,150
the actual act itself be

1332
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:48,523
honest be open be sincere i agree

1333
00:45:48,570 --> 00:45:50,910
be on guard i think sometimes over

1334
00:45:50,910 --> 00:45:52,890
planning can create a situation that is

1335
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:55,440
not comfortable for either person yes now

1336
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:57,390
that said if you are the type

1337
00:45:57,390 --> 00:45:59,040
of people that like that kind of

1338
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:01,200
thing then hell yeah you know what

1339
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:02,760
he means some people do like that

1340
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:04,620
sort of stuff yeah like for instance

1341
00:46:04,620 --> 00:46:05,400
mike dressed up

1342
00:46:05,430 --> 00:46:08,160
like ah chess piece yeah and then

1343
00:46:08,166 --> 00:46:09,990
asked me to move him

1344
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:13,860
and then each square would uncover a

1345
00:46:13,860 --> 00:46:15,641
word yeah right it was over a

1346
00:46:15,641 --> 00:46:17,250
giant field some of those ones that

1347
00:46:17,250 --> 00:46:19,290
are like scavenger hunts you know what's

1348
00:46:19,290 --> 00:46:21,000
coming from the first thing and then

1349
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,980
it's ten yeah that seems like a

1350
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:24,900
lot of effort but i remember he

1351
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:27,840
allowed you to choose the move so

1352
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:31,260
you ended up spelling out will me

1353
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:34,230
you marry yeah and i was like

1354
00:46:34,230 --> 00:46:38,130
whoa yeah the fall you know what

1355
00:46:38,130 --> 00:46:39,900
i won't speak about our proposal but

1356
00:46:40,350 --> 00:46:44,100
it was perfect and it wasn't what

1357
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:44,940
you think

1358
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:48,450
what do you think what do you

1359
00:46:48,450 --> 00:46:50,670
think i think wait youth i never

1360
00:46:50,670 --> 00:46:52,830
actually asked you to marry thanks i

1361
00:46:52,860 --> 00:46:54,330
got to say what i what do

1362
00:46:54,330 --> 00:46:55,110
you think i think is that it

1363
00:46:55,110 --> 00:46:56,460
tells you what the opposite is ok

1364
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:59,130
also what's the a direct opposite was

1365
00:46:59,130 --> 00:47:01,920
it on earth no booze on larger

1366
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:04,500
was fucking out of this world ah

1367
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:05,580
it was amazing

1368
00:47:06,207 --> 00:47:07,980
once an apologies if this person is

1369
00:47:07,980 --> 00:47:09,510
still listening and listening to this but

1370
00:47:09,510 --> 00:47:10,619
i once had a ah at a

1371
00:47:10,619 --> 00:47:13,950
live comedy bang bang show someone wanted

1372
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:15,780
got a message to me backstage saying

1373
00:47:15,780 --> 00:47:18,420
i want to ask i want you

1374
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:21,180
to ask my girlfriend to marry oh

1375
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:22,770
no and yes and i refuse to

1376
00:47:22,770 --> 00:47:24,480
do it i was like yeah you

1377
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:25,950
really should just do this more i've

1378
00:47:25,950 --> 00:47:26,250
had people

1379
00:47:26,314 --> 00:47:28,410
wanting to do that in character yeah

1380
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:29,880
and it's like you don't want that

1381
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:31,800
you know i think this is this

1382
00:47:31,800 --> 00:47:33,420
is something that will be special to

1383
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:34,710
both of you and the person it

1384
00:47:34,710 --> 00:47:36,060
has to be able to process what's

1385
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:37,380
happening i think that's like yeah i

1386
00:47:37,403 --> 00:47:39,390
disagree with that i think if it

1387
00:47:39,390 --> 00:47:40,340
can be if it's because like i'd

1388
00:47:40,340 --> 00:47:42,210
get away many things happening like that

1389
00:47:42,210 --> 00:47:44,100
like there's someone else asking as a

1390
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:46,260
character young wait what or like if

1391
00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:46,410
you

1392
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:47,610
do it if you like surprise them

1393
00:47:47,610 --> 00:47:49,552
too much with like a like a

1394
00:47:49,590 --> 00:47:50,970
lot of people around like i think

1395
00:47:51,180 --> 00:47:52,140
a lot of people wonder if they

1396
00:47:52,140 --> 00:47:54,120
marry the other person right the a

1397
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:56,670
lot of people around thing to me

1398
00:47:56,670 --> 00:47:59,250
sometimes it's like a hedging of a

1399
00:47:59,250 --> 00:48:00,450
bed of like what you can't say

1400
00:48:00,450 --> 00:48:02,580
no because there's some oh yeah yes

1401
00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:04,440
yes yes yes which is which is

1402
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:06,240
like a a comfortable yet

1403
00:48:06,990 --> 00:48:08,340
they can't they can't and they won't

1404
00:48:08,370 --> 00:48:10,200
so i they don't and enjoy it

1405
00:48:10,230 --> 00:48:12,330
but but if if you are if

1406
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:14,310
if if you know the person wants

1407
00:48:14,310 --> 00:48:15,480
you to do this and is waiting

1408
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:17,520
for it and

1409
00:48:18,930 --> 00:48:20,730
you you know that it's good or

1410
00:48:20,730 --> 00:48:23,280
whatever and you both love big spectacles

1411
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:25,230
maybe it's okay but i've just yeah

1412
00:48:25,495 --> 00:48:26,910
like if you're calling asking how to

1413
00:48:26,910 --> 00:48:28,350
do it you probably know that it's

1414
00:48:28,350 --> 00:48:29,700
not gonna be a you probably know

1415
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:30,690
that you're not going to a big

1416
00:48:30,690 --> 00:48:31,650
crazy thing cause you probably have an

1417
00:48:31,650 --> 00:48:33,090
idea of what right right right yeah

1418
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:35,670
your history yeah right sometimes you don't

1419
00:48:35,670 --> 00:48:37,590
necessarily even have to go to the

1420
00:48:37,590 --> 00:48:38,760
original thing of like where

1421
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:40,710
are you met or anything special but

1422
00:48:40,710 --> 00:48:42,450
sometimes that's a nice thing if look

1423
00:48:42,450 --> 00:48:43,380
at where we are i had no

1424
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:45,600
idea mine i didn't really plan anything

1425
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:47,344
more than the location that was all

1426
00:48:47,344 --> 00:48:49,860
i location location location yeah and we

1427
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:50,850
were in real estate

1428
00:48:52,380 --> 00:48:53,250
but that was it i didn't i

1429
00:48:53,250 --> 00:48:54,450
didn't know what i was gonna say

1430
00:48:54,510 --> 00:48:56,460
i knew like the very first thing

1431
00:48:56,460 --> 00:48:57,900
i was gonna say right and that

1432
00:48:57,900 --> 00:48:59,340
way yeah yeah yeah yeah very similar

1433
00:48:59,340 --> 00:49:00,030
to me i mean i was just

1434
00:49:00,030 --> 00:49:00,840
kind of felt like i was just

1435
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:03,120
rambling yes it's such a nerve wreck

1436
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:04,350
when you actually start doing it it's

1437
00:49:04,350 --> 00:49:06,510
like overwhelming with emotion yes you don't

1438
00:49:06,510 --> 00:49:07,500
want to feel like you have to

1439
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:09,030
say a script like just speak from

1440
00:49:09,030 --> 00:49:10,530
the heart like i talked about the

1441
00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:12,090
most stand-up janie famously

1442
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:15,090
interrupted me during my proposal right well

1443
00:49:15,090 --> 00:49:18,060

1445
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:22,260
