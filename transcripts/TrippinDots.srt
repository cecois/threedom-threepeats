27
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,530
ah we should do one like that

28
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:00,030
where one of us is scripted and

29
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:01,350
the other is not like are we

30
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:03,330
never say who would write i think

31
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:04,890
i'd be really clear

32
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,520
how can you see the shuffling of

33
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,620
papers yeah that would be actually clue

34
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,570
i kind of do like that idea

35
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:14,790
oh thank you so much script the

36
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:17,558
whole episode and not tell people that

37
00:01:17,558 --> 00:01:19,380
that is granted yes i don't like

38
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:20,940
that idea that sounds like work oh

39
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:22,260
yeah what if we just record one

40
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,060
write it all out and then re-record

41
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:25,230
it reading lines

42
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:29,850
i'm sorry that's huh

43
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:33,930
but only in a very stilted oh

44
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:35,430
do as best you can i think

45
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:37,534
i've done that several times with rob

46
00:01:37,534 --> 00:01:40,200
buble and tom lennon you've done what

47
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:43,230
that idea where they reenact the conversation

48
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:44,550
they have on the first episode come

49
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:45,990
right back really from just from a

50
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:48,510
transcript from a transcript so sick of

51
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:50,340
my ideas being done alright i know

52
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:50,520
but

53
00:01:50,643 --> 00:01:51,990
just did it but what if we

54
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,430
what if we did it like we're

55
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:56,820
reading court transcripts yeah yeah and we

56
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:59,310
say yeah paul yeah we share names

57
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:01,950
before we say our lines we say

58
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:04,770
our names before we say yeah yeah

59
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,600
laugh during your portrait paul you don't

60
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,160
laugh during it some people probably do

61
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,560
after a court transcript lawrence the funniest

62
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:10,770

have mistaken normal for a female kitten

because of his eyelids

342
00:11:58,025 --> 00:12:01,205

yeah the latin american dub of garfield

353
00:12:22,835 --> 00:12:24,007
and friends this is maybe what you

354
00:12:24,007 --> 00:12:27,515
were watching normal renamed telmo and his

355
00:12:27,515 --> 00:12:29,825
gender changed to female after season one

356
00:12:29,825 --> 00:12:32,285
telmo was changed back to normal despite

357
00:12:32,285 --> 00:12:34,265
this normals gender only changed back to

358
00:12:34,265 --> 00:12:36,665
male near the end of this series

359
00:12:38,225 --> 00:12:40,055
okay the interesting thing there is the

360
00:12:40,055 --> 00:12:42,965
reason why not the timeline why did

361
00:12:42,965 --> 00:12:44,195
they jay yeah why did they change

362
00:12:44,195 --> 00:12:45,515
it back because the eyelashes have been

363
00:12:45,635 --> 00:12:46,775
because people were just like who is

364
00:12:46,805 --> 00:12:48,275
like dating a guy they were like

365
00:12:48,605 --> 00:12:51,815
that's telmo okay yeah that's tell ma

366
00:12:51,965 --> 00:12:53,825
it's not normal i think it should

367
00:12:53,825 --> 00:12:55,745
be illegal firm rules for normal to

368
00:12:55,745 --> 00:12:57,905
change to tell normal also

369
00:12:58,025 --> 00:13:01,115

370
00:13:01,115 --> 00:13:03,575

what you don't want to know because

547
00:19:17,168 --> 00:19:18,335
it because some people might think if

548
00:19:18,335 --> 00:19:19,685

00:19:19,685 --> 00:19:21,335

556
00:19:32,795 --> 00:19:36,095
guesses in and into like sealed envelopes

557
00:19:36,095 --> 00:19:37,655
you know what yeah of course we

558
00:19:37,655 --> 00:19:41,135
are but mainly literally we actually don't

559
00:19:41,135 --> 00:19:42,965
we have not discussed what we think

560
00:19:42,965 --> 00:19:45,215
it is and we don't really like

561
00:19:45,305 --> 00:19:46,415
as we're watching the show we don't

562
00:19:46,415 --> 00:19:47,315
say wonder if it has to do

563
00:19:47,315 --> 00:19:50,015
with that we we are just i

564
00:19:50,075 --> 00:19:51,125
think that james is probably doing the

565
00:19:51,125 --> 00:19:52,955
same thing i am which is why

566
00:19:52,985 --> 00:19:55,625
wondering internally like does this have to

567
00:19:55,805 --> 00:19:56,885
there's been like a few things were

568
00:19:56,885 --> 00:19:58,295
like is just the beginning of it

569
00:19:58,595 --> 00:19:59,975
and then we'll know but of course

570
00:19:59,975 --> 00:20:01,205
we have no idea because it's been

571
00:20:01,473 --> 00:20:03,905
so long time ago yeah yeah for

572
00:20:03,935 --> 00:20:06,245
sorry that you know the famous quote

573
00:20:06,245 --> 00:20:09,125
that's a bitcoin already that i don't

574
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:11,975
mind looking forward to i don't know

575
00:20:11,975 --> 00:20:13,115
that i fuckin

576
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:17,110
so much cheese he's truly terrible um

577
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:18,700
and it's weird that we're okay so

578
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:21,940
we've been bingeing this show and i

579
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:23,530
don't think you're supposed to watch reality

580
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:26,530
tv this way because it feels disgusting

581
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:29,860
it feels disgusting that we are into

582
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:31,360
it and then we keep watching it

583
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:33,790
yeah it feels disgusting to discuss the

584
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:33,910
key

585
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:37,450
characters' motives when they're doing something as

586
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:40,120
if it's all real life it feels

587
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,890
bad yeah and it feels bad that

588
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:44,470
we we are sucked into it yeah

589
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:46,390
so so also deeply i find that

590
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:48,430
i find it very thank you but

591
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:49,840
yeah we're still gonna really sorry you're

592
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,640
going we're still gonna i know i

593
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,170
know the early seasons from what i

594
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:54,040
hear are all

595
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:55,450
about people who work at the same

596
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:57,340
place which i think is fine then

597
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:58,660
it becomes like none of them work

598
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:00,820
there anymore they're all influencers and then

599
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:03,250
it becomes the friend group in quotes

600
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,840
alright even though none of them told

601
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,370
me too much or have i really

602
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:08,140
well yeah yeah i think you are

603
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:09,310
saying you when you go and then

604
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:10,660
it becomes then it becomes well no

605
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:12,010
no what what i'm trying to become

606
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,090

607
00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:14,140

we own the basal i didn't know

685
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:05,740

too complicated now i

690
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:14,950
i was looking for just the score

691
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:16,660

it but it didn't used to be

694
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:20,320
like that because i was like oh

695
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:22,120
i remember going to games growing up

696
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:24,220
and not being confused and explore i

697
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:25,600
would come out he would take the

698
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:28,000
card off but another card on but

699
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,980
the score was always pretty prominent in

700
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:31,120
the old days where yeah and then

701
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,530
there were a few things above it

702
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:33,430
now it's a

703
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:34,913

this

846
00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:51,790

the four of us core four core

849
00:29:56,290 --> 00:29:58,900
four and this comes into play because

850
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:01,300
i i much like baseball so that's

851
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:01,480
not

852
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:05,260
necessary information i bought the ah this

853
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:06,910
is a side story about the woodie

854
00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:10,757
call hotdogs know that you know that

855
00:30:10,757 --> 00:30:13,390
the slurpee fifty tickets a fifty fifty

856
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:16,450
sure about that mean ah where they

857
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:17,650
keep half the money and they give

858
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:19,510
half the money to have whoever wins

859
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,550
but it's like an instant lottery

860
00:30:22,375 --> 00:30:24,385
athena team who wins i'm like why

861
00:30:24,385 --> 00:30:25,645
would they get the money you know

862
00:30:25,645 --> 00:30:26,065
she's cool

863
00:30:28,075 --> 00:30:30,235
no you pay raise the additional twenty

864
00:30:30,235 --> 00:30:33,325
five thousand dollars for unders you pay

865
00:30:33,325 --> 00:30:35,185
ten dollars you get five tickets and

866
00:30:35,185 --> 00:30:38,515
then okay ah the the the team

867
00:30:38,515 --> 00:30:40,885
keeps five dollars and the and whoever

868
00:30:40,885 --> 00:30:43,195
wins gets the the other half of

869
00:30:43,615 --> 00:30:45,145
the pot yes exactly so i was

870
00:30:45,145 --> 00:30:47,095
like if i won

871
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:48,445
when i was going to split it

872
00:30:48,445 --> 00:30:49,765
up and then i realised oh that

873
00:30:49,765 --> 00:30:52,135
would be unfair to the sister who

874
00:30:52,435 --> 00:30:54,085
was gonna come who didn't have the

875
00:30:54,085 --> 00:30:55,495
tickets i was like alright i'll split

876
00:30:55,495 --> 00:30:57,565
this five ways yeah the odds of

877
00:30:57,565 --> 00:30:59,035
you winning are oh i didn't know

878
00:30:59,035 --> 00:31:00,325
my goal and then i started to

879
00:31:00,325 --> 00:31:02,155
think my decision worthy of king solomon

880
00:31:02,155 --> 00:31:03,475
himself then i start to think should

881
00:31:03,475 --> 00:31:05,215
cool up and i take one for

882
00:31:05,215 --> 00:31:07,255
herself only one chair i would say

883
00:31:07,255 --> 00:31:09,865
say you're a house yeah i don't

884
00:31:09,865 --> 00:31:12,805
know anyway i'm twenty one a polit

885
00:31:12,805 --> 00:31:14,905
a five-way oh it was fifty two

886
00:31:14,935 --> 00:31:16,555
thousand dollars wow i guess so i

887
00:31:16,555 --> 00:31:18,595
was like oh five ways but it

888
00:31:18,595 --> 00:31:20,485
would make more sense for you to

889
00:31:20,485 --> 00:31:23,455
keep one and split four ways though

890
00:31:23,455 --> 00:31:25,165
at fifty two then you're talking to

891
00:31:25,165 --> 00:31:27,385
what what is that no i think

892
00:31:27,895 --> 00:31:31,225

box and you just take it right

1125
00:39:13,045 --> 00:39:14,365

1133
00:39:25,615 --> 00:39:26,905

1134
00:39:27,265 --> 00:39:28,495
by the way paul what you said

1135
00:39:28,495 --> 00:39:30,385

1136
00:39:30,385 --> 00:39:32,095
was walking by i feel like i

1137
00:39:32,215 --> 00:39:34,345
contributed yeah as he was walking by

1138
00:39:34,345 --> 00:39:34,555
when

1139
00:39:34,645 --> 00:39:38,365
let's go piss pigs know what that's

1140
00:39:38,365 --> 00:39:40,585
next level that's to start a group

1141
00:39:40,585 --> 00:39:41,875
chat and nobody knows what it means

1142
00:39:41,875 --> 00:39:43,645
and then people start brawling and it's

1143
00:39:44,125 --> 00:39:46,045
to be do you consider piss to

1144
00:39:46,045 --> 00:39:48,415
be a curse word i think piss

1145
00:39:48,415 --> 00:39:52,349
pig is it sounds really derogatory yeah

1146
00:39:52,372 --> 00:39:53,575

a you know public space

1148
00:39:54,912 --> 00:39:56,395

1235
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:54,470
i need to know

1236
00:42:54,830 --> 00:42:57,620
about how frasier himself ended up singing

1237
00:42:57,620 --> 00:43:00,560
the song because when in the reality

1238
00:43:00,590 --> 00:43:02,450
of the shadows singer ah no he's

1239
00:43:02,450 --> 00:43:03,680
not known to me as a singer

1240
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:06,080
so when did the neither frazier nor

1241
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:08,030
kelsey kelsey grammer i mean i mean

1242
00:43:08,030 --> 00:43:10,040
both but i'm saying so the reality

1243
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:12,890
of the show there's there's a prequel

1244
00:43:12,890 --> 00:43:14,630
episode that discussed

1245
00:43:14,630 --> 00:43:16,070
is how he actually came to sing

1246
00:43:16,070 --> 00:43:18,590
this hall no well in the reality

1247
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:20,600
show where's the song coming from can

1248
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:22,100
the people hear it because usually it

1249
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:23,840
would be over it's over the end

1250
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:26,690
credits will the recovery episode of sigh

1251
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:28,640
here every episode there's a little there's

1252
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:31,100
a little ah silent vignette that's happen

1253
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:34,340
every episode of frasier happens the thirty

1254
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:34,700
minutes

1255
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:36,230
for he just happens to sing that

1256
00:43:36,230 --> 00:43:38,810
song so whatever whatever the thirty minutes

1257
00:43:38,810 --> 00:43:40,340
before he sings that song is that's

1258
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:41,960
an episode but because i raise your

1259
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:43,100
episodes are in real time at the

1260
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:45,200
same time good senses but the song

1261
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:47,330
has nothing to do with the premise

1262
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:49,940
know so then it's like okay the

1263
00:43:49,940 --> 00:43:52,550
actor is singing a random song about

1264
00:43:52,550 --> 00:43:54,530
tossed salad and scrambled eggs which by

1265
00:43:54,530 --> 00:43:54,950
the way

1266
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:57,290
