256
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:30,000
that i was horny enough okay so

257
00:09:30,026 --> 00:09:32,250
tap it the list basically says whale

258
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,020
duck alligator these are all getting really

259
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:35,880
weird we've got the kitna we have

260
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,710
a slow whale mammal is the name

261
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:41,040
of the song oh man oh man

262
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,080
a whale can only fuck another whale

263
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:43,890
right like if it

264
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:44,910
tried to fuck it off and it

265
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:46,230
would be morally yes

266
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:49,980
but it would be bad for the

267
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:52,020
doll why why would mating be painful

268
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:53,432
for an animal cats it says meeting

269
00:09:53,432 --> 00:09:55,230
as painful like why would why would

270
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:57,810
anyone who's yeah yeah yeah it's just

271
00:09:57,810 --> 00:09:59,190
more proof there is not a god

272
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,480
because when you want the cats to

273
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,160
have pleasure but there are so many

274
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,770
cats they don't it doesn't stop them

275
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,930
they have the horny impulse they have

276
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:07,380
the horse

277
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:11,215
and care about the female cat cats

278
00:10:11,305 --> 00:10:11,935
it's like

279
00:10:14,095 --> 00:10:16,525
so they're like okay the female cats

280
00:10:16,525 --> 00:10:18,355
they don't like this i gotta grow

281
00:10:18,355 --> 00:10:21,805
some bars to just trapper there yeah

282
00:10:21,985 --> 00:10:23,065
like she wants it but then when

283
00:10:23,065 --> 00:10:24,835
it starts she doesn't want it because

284
00:10:24,835 --> 00:10:26,995
it sucks it sucks so i got

285
00:10:26,995 --> 00:10:30,955
a fuckin i got trapper trapper keeper

286
00:10:31,855 --> 00:10:33,292

that's right we have to be forever

288
00:10:34,318 --> 00:10:36,415

289
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:38,155

00:13:38,812 --> 00:13:40,435
there oh yeah and pointing that out

371
00:13:40,435 --> 00:13:41,425
it's like that's true even if it's

372
00:13:41,425 --> 00:13:44,035
kind of irrelevant that's true yeah it

373
00:13:44,035 --> 00:13:45,085
feels like the news is a little

374
00:13:45,085 --> 00:13:47,425
bit like bias and slash crash jerry

375
00:13:47,425 --> 00:13:49,315
stone because the person was driving in

376
00:13:49,315 --> 00:13:51,025
the yeah yeah i do hope they

377
00:13:51,025 --> 00:13:55,135
get self-driving cars under control that's scary

378
00:13:56,061 --> 00:13:57,955
right you want it i want it

379
00:13:57,985 --> 00:13:58,795
i think it would be great i

380
00:13:58,795 --> 00:14:00,445
was i think have i talked about

381
00:14:00,445 --> 00:14:01,345
this i was talking to my mom

382
00:14:01,345 --> 00:14:03,865
about it because i think any sort

383
00:14:03,865 --> 00:14:05,575
of new technology in older person is

384
00:14:05,575 --> 00:14:07,285
like fearful of and she was like

385
00:14:07,285 --> 00:14:09,475
no i would love it because she

386
00:14:09,475 --> 00:14:10,813
doesn't wanna drive she just wanna drive

387
00:14:10,836 --> 00:14:11,785
and she's like if i could get

388
00:14:11,785 --> 00:14:13,735
into a car and just punch in

389
00:14:13,735 --> 00:14:15,415
where it should go and then know

390
00:14:15,415 --> 00:14:15,775
that it's

391
00:14:15,805 --> 00:14:17,365
safely going to take me there it

392
00:14:17,365 --> 00:14:19,165
would be so it feels like every

393
00:14:19,165 --> 00:14:20,845
car has to be doing that then

394
00:14:21,145 --> 00:14:23,005
that's how i feel about it either

395
00:14:23,095 --> 00:14:24,775
everybody has it or nobody has yeah

396
00:14:24,805 --> 00:14:25,615
i don't think there should just be

397
00:14:25,615 --> 00:14:26,785
a car with nobody in the driver's

398
00:14:26,785 --> 00:14:28,375
seat driving behind me and cutting out

399
00:14:28,465 --> 00:14:29,905
there shouldn't be five cars out there

400
00:14:29,995 --> 00:14:31,885
yeah i think they can do this

401
00:14:31,885 --> 00:14:35,301
yeah i love driving them i don't

402
00:14:35,335 --> 00:14:35,965
i don't mind driving

403
00:14:35,995 --> 00:14:38,815

430
00:15:30,685 --> 00:15:32,335
with finger wag if he did random

431
00:15:32,515 --> 00:15:33,685
noise for news

433
00:15:37,285 --> 00:15:38,755
be with the crowd i was happy

434
00:15:38,755 --> 00:15:40,345
that he had like a sense of

435
00:15:40,345 --> 00:15:42,565
humor about it yeah well yeah imagine

436
00:15:42,565 --> 00:15:43,795

437
00:15:43,795 --> 00:15:45,685
a four way stop in my neighborhood

438
00:15:46,345 --> 00:15:50,815
and i thought i had gotten there

439
00:15:50,815 --> 00:15:53,275
before this other car right that was

440
00:15:53,575 --> 00:15:54,865
coming the opposite direction

441
00:15:55,675 --> 00:15:58,225
and i was about to turn and

442
00:15:58,225 --> 00:16:03,055

00:16:03,085 --> 00:16:05,995
like i just went an inch into

444
00:16:05,995 --> 00:16:08,395
the into the intersection to turn and

445
00:16:08,395 --> 00:16:11,185
i saw this big flurry of ah

446
00:16:11,215 --> 00:16:14,575
motion behind the windshield and then i

447
00:16:14,575 --> 00:16:15,055

448
00:16:15,115 --> 00:16:17,545
and it was was somebody that i

449
00:16:17,545 --> 00:16:20,245
knew and who knew me and then

450
00:16:20,245 --> 00:16:23,605
like changed like their demeanor completely changed

451
00:16:24,115 --> 00:16:25,765
like oh accidents happen but i will

452
00:16:25,765 --> 00:16:29,185
never forget that the true your yes

453
00:16:29,185 --> 00:16:33,355
yeah so we should always treat everyone

454
00:16:33,415 --> 00:16:35,245
who are strangers like they're free

455
00:16:35,245 --> 00:16:36,895
and can you imagine also i think

456
00:16:36,895 --> 00:16:38,035
op's know can you imagine if your

457
00:16:38,065 --> 00:16:40,705
treat your acquaintances like strange exactly yeah

458
00:16:40,735 --> 00:16:42,805
if you almost got hit and you're

459
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:44,305
going with that method of thinking and

460
00:16:44,305 --> 00:16:46,855
you're like hey can you not you're

461
00:16:46,855 --> 00:16:48,385
my friend like it's like that would

462
00:16:48,385 --> 00:16:49,825
be a really weird your brain doesn't

463
00:16:49,825 --> 00:16:51,625
do that yeah you're not defending yourself

464
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:54,325
by going like hey stranger but here's

465
00:16:54,325 --> 00:16:55,375
the thing you didn't mean

466
00:16:55,429 --> 00:16:56,965
knew that we weren't in danger there

467
00:16:56,965 --> 00:16:59,155
was no danger in the situation shirts

468
00:16:59,335 --> 00:17:00,535
we were so far away from each

469
00:17:00,535 --> 00:17:02,185
other it was just it was that

470
00:17:02,185 --> 00:17:03,985

i didn't then let me guess you

554
00:19:38,575 --> 00:19:39,325
owe me you told

555
00:19:39,355 --> 00:19:40,585
her you are older and had more

556
00:19:40,585 --> 00:19:43,015
insurance i thought fried green tomatoes feel

557
00:19:43,045 --> 00:19:44,785
like noise just now and i sort

558
00:19:44,785 --> 00:19:46,702
of think that if everybody does it

559
00:19:46,702 --> 00:19:48,175
today it's the exact same things it

560
00:19:48,175 --> 00:19:50,125
is the same thing i've never seen

561
00:19:50,125 --> 00:19:52,135
either just i just got sandy very

562
00:19:52,165 --> 00:19:53,455
green tomatoes i don't know i saw

563
00:19:53,455 --> 00:19:55,465
steel magnolias for the first time oh

564
00:19:55,795 --> 00:19:57,205
but i'll never see it i liked

565
00:19:57,205 --> 00:19:58,945
it i was i was making a

566
00:19:58,945 --> 00:19:59,455
left into a

567
00:19:59,485 --> 00:20:02,155
parking space and then right as i

568
00:20:02,215 --> 00:20:05,575
pulled in the person on the um

569
00:20:06,145 --> 00:20:08,305
the right the spot in the right

570
00:20:08,305 --> 00:20:10,645
hand swung her door open and i

571
00:20:10,675 --> 00:20:13,675
yeah hit her the edge of her

572
00:20:13,675 --> 00:20:15,355
door like straight on with my car

573
00:20:15,685 --> 00:20:17,485
anyway that's a very easy thing to

574
00:20:17,485 --> 00:20:18,565
happen because i feel like people aren't

575
00:20:18,565 --> 00:20:19,555
always looking myself

576
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:22,470
another phone and she's had her open

577
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:25,350
her heart out looking um seem to

578
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:28,320
think it was her or was my

579
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,880
fault and was treating it like it

580
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:32,070
was my fault and that feels like

581
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:34,590
it's both people know it's let's say

582
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:38,400
hurtful family and the investigation it's also

583
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:40,410
just bad timing yeah

584
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,780
essential obsession but it's but but any

585
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:45,180
door stealing hurtful throwing your door open

586
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,470
you're gonna have control of what just

587
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:48,210
outside you have to look because like

588
00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:49,770
if you're driving down the street and

589
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:51,360
someone in a parked car throws their

590
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,710
door open and you run into it

591
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:54,330
it's their fault yeah that makes sense

592
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:55,800
so it was her fault but she

593
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,090
was treating it like it was my

594
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:58,950
fault and he was very weird i

595
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:00,480
just felt weird about it like in

596
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:00,570
my

597
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,640
head just going like you know this

598
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,980
is your fault you your best lady

599
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:07,380
but people are kind of trained to

600
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:10,590
immediately not take blame because the law

601
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:12,030
is well very true that's why i

602
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:13,290
started wondering is is like are you

603
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:14,850
is this just you jockeying for your

604
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:16,306
insurance because you know your insurance always

605
00:21:16,326 --> 00:21:19,380
has never take responsibility never fallen but

606
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:20,730
she was but never falling

607
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:24,120
responsibility is like super fucked up it's

608
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:26,130
like if you clearly did something it's

609
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:27,630
okay to be like i did that

610
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,820
well the first big car accident i

611
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:31,680
got into where i totalled my wife's

612
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,910
car when i was learning to drive

613
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:35,490
yeah um i had my license for

614
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:38,250

615
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:39,300
blew through a stop sign that i

616
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:40,770
just didn't do the same

617
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:45,300
wide intersection and this car t-boned me

618
00:21:45,690 --> 00:21:47,250
and then we are we're getting out

619
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:49,830
of our cars and then she the

620
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:51,270
other driver was like did anybody see

621
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:52,800

623
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:56,610

649
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:43,410
my teacher was at a barbecue right

ten to shoot one person yeah because

904
00:31:24,365 --> 00:31:26,405
the way you because one guy is

905
00:31:26,405 --> 00:31:28,595
blank you want you know it takes

906
00:31:28,625 --> 00:31:30,455
nine bullets to shoot to kill someone

907
00:31:30,455 --> 00:31:32,705
what if you miss three people miss

908
00:31:32,705 --> 00:31:34,565

go upstairs and we're in the i

1144
00:39:35,435 --> 00:39:37,835
remember it was like a den that

1145
00:39:37,835 --> 00:39:38,345
had

1146
00:39:39,425 --> 00:39:41,255
yeah it wasn't even it was like

1147
00:39:41,255 --> 00:39:43,204
sort of like french doors but it

1148
00:39:43,204 --> 00:39:45,785
didn't seem like real doors necessarily um

1149
00:39:46,625 --> 00:39:48,365
but we we and i remember we

1150
00:39:48,365 --> 00:39:49,955
didn't even start the movie we just

1151
00:39:49,955 --> 00:39:52,085
kind of started making out right and

1152
00:39:52,145 --> 00:39:57,155
email yeah yeah and so then suddenly

1153
00:39:57,155 --> 00:39:59,255
there's like this and this is what

1154
00:39:59,255 --> 00:39:59,585
i think of

1155
00:39:59,615 --> 00:40:00,665
when i think of the movie fear

1156
00:40:00,665 --> 00:40:04,178
because there's just like this bipap papa

1157
00:40:04,295 --> 00:40:07,342
on the door loud la papa papa

1158
00:40:07,445 --> 00:40:09,935
this is what inspired that because i

1159
00:40:09,965 --> 00:40:11,645
have actually have a story about that

1160
00:40:11,645 --> 00:40:14,285
specific moment yeah because it's in the

1161
00:40:14,285 --> 00:40:15,799
trailer i've never seen it and there's

1162
00:40:15,845 --> 00:40:17,405
so there's a scene where he goes

1163
00:40:17,465 --> 00:40:18,905
he's yelling with these people they got

1164
00:40:18,935 --> 00:40:19,625
yeah and so the

1165
00:40:19,775 --> 00:40:21,035
the dad is going to quickly like

1166
00:40:21,035 --> 00:40:23,015
the that the killer is typing in

1167
00:40:23,015 --> 00:40:24,635
the code it's opening and right he

1168
00:40:24,635 --> 00:40:27,305
sounds because he says something calmly he's

1169
00:40:27,305 --> 00:40:29,195
like i gonna come in there and

1170
00:40:29,195 --> 00:40:30,291
i'm gonna kill all you something something

1171
00:40:30,291 --> 00:40:31,535
something whatever he says i'm gonna come

1172
00:40:31,535 --> 00:40:33,455
in and then you'll he gonna come

1173
00:40:33,455 --> 00:40:37,835
in and actually ad libbed improvise so

1174
00:40:37,835 --> 00:40:39,425
let me in the fucking house

1175
00:40:40,567 --> 00:40:43,440
really scary within the instagram post said

1176
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:46,170
that the director the the editor cut

1177
00:40:46,170 --> 00:40:47,670
that and put it into the the

1178
00:40:47,670 --> 00:40:49,080
gag rule because it wasn't in the

1179
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:50,850
script and the director was so upset

1180
00:40:50,850 --> 00:40:51,780
when he saw that wasn't home he

1181
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:52,530
had it put in the film i'm

1182
00:40:52,530 --> 00:40:54,360
like that is a key that was

1183
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:56,580
an amazing ad-lib and was very scary

1184
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:59,040
it changes the whole scene right and

1185
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,480
it's so good and it's like that

1186
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:00,660
sort

1187
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:02,310
of ninety s like obsession with the

1188
00:41:02,310 --> 00:41:04,170
fish-eye yeah yeah it was the fish-eye

1189
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:05,730
yeah i've never seen the movie but

1190
00:41:05,730 --> 00:41:07,470
i just remember that anytime i fish

1191
00:41:07,530 --> 00:41:09,090
in the screaming yeah anytime i think

1192
00:41:09,090 --> 00:41:10,710
of that i think about when this

1193
00:41:10,710 --> 00:41:12,390
happened yeah it was basically like her

1194
00:41:12,390 --> 00:41:16,350
ex-boyfriends oh basically like who was an

1195
00:41:16,410 --> 00:41:20,216
army guy huh um but basically it

1196
00:41:20,216 --> 00:41:20,790
was greenplum

00:41:20,910 --> 00:41:23,970

1198
00:41:23,970 --> 00:41:24,450

no but he he filled a bag

1200
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:29,280
of his buddies came over i think

1201
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,630
he was watching the house or something

1202
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:32,340
and saw this fool that i was

1203
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:34,320
there and started to try to break

1204
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:36,630
the door down to like fuck me

1205
00:41:36,630 --> 00:41:39,210
up or something know for our country

1206
00:41:39,270 --> 00:41:41,280
for our country and they called the

1207
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:43,290
police and the police came and i

1208
00:41:43,290 --> 00:41:44,190

1209
00:41:44,190 --> 00:41:45,210
police and all that and i was

1210
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:45,780

really freaked out by wow um and

1212
00:41:48,090 --> 00:41:50,160
then the phantom must have been like

1213
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,570
the next week or something like that

1214
00:41:51,570 --> 00:41:53,070
because we still went together but that

1215
00:41:53,070 --> 00:41:54,210
was the last time we ever had

1216
00:41:54,210 --> 00:41:55,560
a date i don't think we ever

according to paul's fifth grade music teacher

1512
00:52:20,030 --> 00:52:21,320
a song can be a rock and

1513
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:24,230
roll song and listen to what instrument

1514
00:52:24,290 --> 00:52:25,490
yep thank you

1515
00:52:27,380 --> 00:52:29,810
and this by the way i'm benefiting

1516
00:52:29,810 --> 00:52:31,760
from this being constantly talked about yeah

1517
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:34,010
we're almost became a character man now

1518
00:52:34,032 --> 00:52:36,140
fair in the car i am glad

1519
00:52:36,140 --> 00:52:37,880
to be reminded of paul was the

1520
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:40,160
president of a four member club headquartered

1521
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:41,720
in his childhood basement what was the

1522
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:43,730
name of the club my god that's

1523
00:52:43,730 --> 00:52:46,490
really hard that's that's honestly unfair i

1524
00:52:46,490 --> 00:52:46,820
don't think

1525
00:52:47,450 --> 00:52:49,160
remember that um

1526
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:55,040
okay okay five and final question when

1527
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:57,080
paul played jigar in a production of

1528
00:52:57,170 --> 00:52:59,390
aerosol what offensive phrase that he used

1529
00:52:59,390 --> 00:53:00,980
to insult the character of julie

1530
00:53:01,550 --> 00:53:04,970
ah it was in the script ah

1531
00:53:04,970 --> 00:53:08,330
shit it was what i was in

1532
00:53:08,330 --> 00:53:10,190
that show i think i i have

1533
00:53:10,190 --> 00:53:11,720
a guess and it's not right but

1534
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:13,310
i think it's close like but if

1535
00:53:13,310 --> 00:53:15,170
it's not close it's funny i remember

1536
00:53:15,170 --> 00:53:17,270

1593
00:55:18,050 --> 00:55:19,550
i can if you guys wanted to

1594
00:55:19,550 --> 00:55:19,700
be

1595
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:22,762
called the the audience overwhelmingly yes yes

1596
00:55:22,824 --> 00:55:24,710
i think about democracy from somebody who

1597
00:55:24,710 --> 00:55:26,930
said they wanted to be called little

1598
00:55:26,930 --> 00:55:30,080
ducky pigs oh okay i've saw that

1599
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:32,810
too that's one person yeah i like

1600
00:55:32,860 --> 00:55:34,970
the the issue is is everyone voted

1601
00:55:34,970 --> 00:55:37,250
on the chance was this right i'm

1602
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:39,800
honest reddit vote i forget where it

1603
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:39,920
has

1604
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:41,360
opened i think i think they went

1605
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:42,950
to actually they went to the polls

1606
00:55:43,130 --> 00:55:46,160
okay i think on election day they

1607
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:47,330
say we're also going to hold a

1608
00:55:47,330 --> 00:55:50,030
separate flash it was made sense just

1609
00:55:50,060 --> 00:55:51,650
because everyone's just doing good just to

1610
00:55:51,650 --> 00:55:52,760
