ah life

7
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:35,280
the long time yeah sooo well that's

8
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:38,100
good okay marriages do with marriage marriages

9
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,200
just be twenty years and then we

10
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:43,680
like reassess without having all the financial

11
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,840
considerations of a divorce it's just like

12
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,150
i want to marry you for twenty

13
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:51,990
years this was a plot in something

14
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:55,140
i residence the simpsons or seinfeld

15
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:57,720
where the people there were a married

16
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:01,140
couple who every year on their anniversary

17
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:02,430
would decide if they were gonna stay

18
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:04,290
together or not but i think i

19
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:07,860
think legally legally the problem is then

20
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:10,707
suddenly like a divorce proceeding happens you

21
00:01:10,707 --> 00:01:12,330
have to split everything equally it's like

22
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:13,590
could we just like

23
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:16,110
you just want it to be like

24
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:17,822

not like that as a kid i

101
00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:23,580
feel like i was because i remember

102
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:25,440
my brother would console

103
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,290
gently do stuff like he would take

104
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:31,350
off the plates on the electric plugs

105
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:34,050

00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,890
i was always like those come off

108
00:04:38,212 --> 00:04:41,370

00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:43,980
and he was chose i yeah yeah

110
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:45,510

111
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,070

was three hundred and sixty five days

116
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:55,350
for me but as it is considered

117
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:57,870
three sixty four because it's like there's

118
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:59,746
one last daily or twelve and then

119
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:02,070

the walls and wires and shit but

174
00:06:56,073 --> 00:06:57,519
what's up with your brain when you

175
00:06:57,519 --> 00:06:59,580
think it is i think i do

176
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:01,500
not care about how things work you

177
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,350
are from a very brief wonder where

178
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:06,270
somebody who's learned to think about it

179
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:08,490
and then you didn't care yeah i

180
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:10,710
truly i think that was ah my

181
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,900
my father who was always a person

182
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:13,920
who if there was something

183
00:07:13,951 --> 00:07:15,300
wrong announce he would fix it he

184
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,440
would like look up to fix fixing

185
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,430
yeah because he didn't want to pay

186
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:20,250
for yeah right your wish i really

00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:39,950
always

284
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:41,420
in each other's business i think that's

285
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:43,850
just like a different kind of thing

286
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:47,900
yeah yeah it is because ah that's

287
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,880
not good what about you but you

288
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,170
had so many siblings we have so

289
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:52,280
many people we were always in each

290
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:54,350
other's business but not in a great

291
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:58,310
way um but we all we valued

292
00:10:58,310 --> 00:11:00,050
privacy you'd go into your room which

293
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:02,150
be your sanctum and you each of

294
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:04,460
you had your own eventually but we

295
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:06,680
shared rooms for a long time because

296
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:07,820
it was so goddamn many of us

297
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:12,380
yeah um and yeah i remember i

298
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,000
remember getting my own room and it

299
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,310

300
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:18,080
my sisters had moved out and everything

301
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,270

00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:57,950
but but lauren your doors never even

319
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:00,650
close well my door was closed it

320
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:02,210
was more of a like it wasn't

321
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:03,920
always able to be fully closed in

322
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,330
the winter a wood fully closed in

323
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:06,380
the summer it would not in the

324
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:10,040
summer would expand yeah and sometimes door

325
00:12:10,045 --> 00:12:11,660
just wouldn't and wouldn't close but i

326
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:14,990
could still close it and you honor

327
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:15,230
that

328
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:17,360
at love you have to honor it

329
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,640
yeah when you see the club closed

330
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:22,010
door but yeah i mean i feel

331
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:25,550
like um it's it's interestingly thinking of

332
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:28,640
kids having a lock all the doors

333
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,140
in my house have locks so it's

334
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:31,730
like i guess one's holly figures out

335
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:33,080
what that is she could lock the

336
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,390
door yeah like that's weird

337
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:36,860
rd i don't know but he was

338
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:38,480
like a teenager thing like once we

339
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:39,920
doing after afternoon to lock the door

340
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,900
yeah because your parents don't wanna walk

341
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:43,970
in on you yeah well also you

342
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,040
listening to me it's worse it's worse

343
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,080
for them right it's bad for everyone

344
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,790
is bad for everyone involved yeah you

345
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:52,404
gotta knock yeah you gotta knock yeah

346
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,110
but i think it was also related

347
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:55,340
you got an act i think it

348
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:55,460
was

349
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:56,720
so my brother not wanting me to

350
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,520
go in his room and vice versa

351
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:00,440
it was more against each other oh

352
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,850
yeah well yeah i'm sure my brother

353
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:03,140
was trying to keep me out but

354
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:05,540

376
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,630
one from the other side in my

377
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:55,550
family was

378
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:57,890
so when i went to a funeral

379
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:00,830
for one of my relatives many years

380
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:02,570
ago and this old woman who i

381
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:04,190
don't know what her relationship was to

382
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:06,680
me or shorter nose stroke your face

383
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,330
and say thinner yeah that was like

384
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:12,590
dying she was like look for dimes

385
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:14,540
here she takes like look for times

386
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:16,730
if you see a dime that's him

387
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:18,350
saying hello like look for names and

388
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:18,830
then you would

389
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,720
then you would stems and it's actually

390
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,720
very interesting because it's like i understand

391
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,280
there's somebody out there is like it's

392
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,650
because this is whatever the yeah because

393
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:30,530
like there's actually whenever and whenever them

394
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:32,480
well but i'm for you no more

395
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,610
i've seen other people would say well

396
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:36,440
the logic behind it is actually i'm

397
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:39,020
saying you see all of types of

398
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:39,230
coins

399
00:14:39,281 --> 00:14:41,092
do i really real right the times

400
00:14:41,092 --> 00:14:42,170
do i like what i'm doing i'm

401
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:45,650
just being them okay but i feel

402
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:46,850
like there will be many times where

403
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:47,930
it was just a dime where it's

404
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:49,640
like why isn't it a nickel or

405
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:52,310
quarter penny and then it felt like

406
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:53,510
it was like it is a dime

407
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:56,210
it is a sign okay it does

408
00:14:56,210 --> 00:14:58,310
make me think of the person yes

409
00:14:58,340 --> 00:14:59,390
that's what that's nice yeah

410
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:00,170
so what i'm saying is there i

411
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:01,310
don't think other people there is a

412
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:03,500
logical yeah reason behind it but for

413
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,940
you it was just a nice like

414
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,070
hey this doesn't actually make sense but

415
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:08,000
it is making me think of the

416
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,500
person it's a nice thing yeah and

417
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:10,760
do you think if it's a message

418
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,530
from beyond you think the the person

419
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:14,150
the departed person is saying give me

420
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:16,610
ten cents yeah i do think guys

421
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:18,050

422
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,430

00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:53,510
like sito one of those what are

555
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:55,190
they wearing a t-shirt that's kinda looks

556
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:56,780
like a tux it's like yeah funny

557
00:19:56,842 --> 00:19:58,130
yeah but this is like a whole

558
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:00,860
thing was that the eighties i feel

559
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:03,590
i remember is the eighties yeah feels

560
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:05,060
like yeah they might be earlier than

561
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:06,170
that but i remember it from the

562
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:08,750
eighties like late seventies yeah but yeah

563
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:10,730
it felt like the height of humour

564
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:15,010
your tomato probably wore one without a

565
00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:18,040
duped ignoring a dude with who to

566
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:21,460
doute ignore ignoring all like history and

567
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:23,410
like the bad parts of consider it's

568
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:24,070
own life

569
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:26,290
let's erase all of what's like the

570
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:27,490
best what's the decade with the best

571
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:30,430
vibes just were judging it just on

572
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:32,290
vibes yeah it's like don't think about

573
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,300
how there were really bad things happening

574
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,580
and like people were treated horribly and

575
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:38,830
i guess when does the civil war

576
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:39,220
happened

577
00:20:40,791 --> 00:20:42,670
eight because he got disco i'm like

578
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:44,590
seventy s yeah i lived through it

i the tea parties i just love

580
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,670
how it looks parties i think the

581
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:51,220
sixties because well the early sixties probably

582
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:54,460
sucked we are you including bad bad

583
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:56,080
things that happened in history you're right

584
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:57,670
i'm sorry yeah should just count those

585
00:20:57,670 --> 00:21:00,430

time as long as you're rich yeah

00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:12,160
ignoring we're ignoring or hell that thing

640
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:46,570
to like suffer old of course i

641
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:48,280
said i want to sound like old

642
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,470
like house that i can't remember it

643
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:52,240
was probably like the best ross house

644
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,410
there was the betsy ross house in

645
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:55,120
philadelphia okay but i think it was

646
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:55,660
in d c

647
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:57,550
and i don't see of course there's

648
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:59,860
monta cello whatever i'm jeff harris hearing

649
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:00,730
was which

650
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:04,510
historical character but i walked through an

651
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:06,520
old house and but there wasn't anyone

652
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,840
acting like it was that time and

653
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,550
i think right what i'm gonna need

654
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:11,200
is someone acting like that i think

655
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:12,550
i do think it'd be very funny

656
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:13,780
to go on like a family trip

657
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:15,520
with my children to a place like

658
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,960
that and make them do that shit

659
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:18,490
like i think that's absolutely really fun

660
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:20,620
yeah yeah yeah we went in london

661
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:21,970

665
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:29,530

00:23:32,290 --> 00:23:34,930
before well things started right yeah twenty

668
00:23:34,930 --> 00:23:36,670

670
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,660

671
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:42,190
the world great yeah yeah

672
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:43,060
it's true if you don't think about

673
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:45,070
anything bad happening everything was good yeah

674
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:47,860

of those things where it was bad

676
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,160
but doesn't get worse so it's technically

882
00:30:51,585 --> 00:30:53,415

00:30:53,445 --> 00:30:54,285
of your life but you never got

that that was part of the trip

893
00:31:10,695 --> 00:31:12,285
is we went and i had thought

894
00:31:12,285 --> 00:31:14,205
it had been planned that we were

895
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:16,365

896
00:31:16,365 --> 00:31:18,975
time but and i remember there being

897
00:31:18,975 --> 00:31:19,605

tour with his band after skanda vol

1218
00:44:00,860 --> 00:44:01,940
at least he had a band

1219
00:44:03,590 --> 00:44:04,730
what if he just went on tour

1220
00:44:04,730 --> 00:44:06,830
going scandal remember what he was like

1221
00:44:07,010 --> 00:44:09,020
hitting the wall with a hammer and

1222
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:11,870
going scanned of all i don't like

1223
00:44:11,870 --> 00:44:12,980
this guy i don't think he's good

1224
00:44:13,010 --> 00:44:14,180
but if he did that on tour

1225
00:44:14,690 --> 00:44:16,250
he brought out a sledgehammer and probably

1226
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:19,850
like gallagher or peter gabriel like gallagher

1227
00:44:19,850 --> 00:44:22,370
wow can someone take over gallagher's sledgehammer

1228
00:44:22,370 --> 00:44:22,910
duties

1229
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:24,950
i thought his brother did that i

1230
00:44:24,950 --> 00:44:26,060
know but i mean now that he's

1231
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:27,560
gone can can we just do it

1232
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,460
like public domain yeah i think it's

1233
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:32,840
up for anybody if anybody wants to

1234
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:34,010
make that their comedy i think you

1235
00:44:34,010 --> 00:44:35,450
could do you think smashing a watermelon

1236
00:44:35,450 --> 00:44:36,590
with the big maladies in the public

1237
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:38,090
domain and i think it's just kind

1238
00:44:38,090 --> 00:44:40,220
of an oman at this point you

1239
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:41,660
think like the first person who ever

1240
00:44:41,660 --> 00:44:44,000
picked up a guitar and sang like

1241
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,460
they own that well i know a

1242
00:44:46,460 --> 00:44:47,960
friend he got his first real six

1243
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:48,560
string

1244
00:44:49,130 --> 00:44:50,300
he bought her the five and dime

1245
00:44:50,330 --> 00:44:52,190
i know yeah i've heard of him

1246
00:44:52,220 --> 00:44:54,230
this was i mean this is it

1247
00:44:54,230 --> 00:44:56,060
feels like it was about fifty four

1248
00:44:56,090 --> 00:44:57,860
fifty five or something like that yeah

1249
00:44:58,002 --> 00:45:00,015
yeah but it's like a big story

1250
00:45:00,110 --> 00:45:02,510
just story that's told a lot yeah

1251
00:45:02,630 --> 00:45:04,880
yeah i mean he considers it the

1252
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:07,550
best days of his life really obviously

1253
00:45:07,550 --> 00:45:08,960
i mean honestly it's only

1254
00:45:08,990 --> 00:45:11,030
he was really free god damn i

1255
00:45:11,030 --> 00:45:13,010
don't think i can look back at

1256
00:45:13,010 --> 00:45:14,810
the past and say those are the

1257
00:45:14,810 --> 00:45:16,730
best years of my life maybe when

1258
00:45:16,730 --> 00:45:18,320
i'm very old i can do that

1259
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:19,820
but i right now i feel like

1260
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:21,560
i'm having you couldn't name the halcyon

1261
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:23,900
days of your life right now i

1262
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:25,847
like to think i'm in them i

1263
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:27,560
know i'm miserable all the time yeah

1264
00:45:27,620 --> 00:45:28,910
no i think i said

1265
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:32,870
each each era has a positive thing

1266
00:45:32,870 --> 00:45:33,920
to it but each era has a

1267
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:36,440
positive thing for sure i was thinking

1268
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:39,320
about the decades and like what what

1269
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:42,290
just all of them yeah like twenties

1270
00:45:42,290 --> 00:45:45,050

00:45:53,150 --> 00:45:55,160
their own flavor yeah i mean like

1277
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:58,640
