00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:44,280
what you watched no i already told

150
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:47,580
you ah was bernie and arthur and

151
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,170
um when you were when that is

152
00:05:49,209 --> 00:05:51,210
why i need to yeah yeah that's

153
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:53,340
what i'm saying i was watching yeah

154
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:54,750
the point of it being q you

155
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:57,540
know but um i guess when my

156
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:59,370
sister was born i would watch

157
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:03,810
kind of monitor yes sawyer much how

158
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:04,800
old are you and she was ah

159
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:06,120
eight and a half oh that's a

160
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,430
pretty big guy a pretty big um

and so are you about my mom

when my sister came out it's a

163

pretty big gap

164
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:16,140
but that's part of it i think

165
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:17,160
too is like if you have a

166
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,630

167
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:20,970

watching through their eyes and stuff like

169
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:25,440

00:13:36,515 --> 00:13:38,615

what i actually be able to do

375
00:13:40,565 --> 00:13:41,915
that because that's the way to do

376
00:13:41,945 --> 00:13:44,135

377
00:13:44,135 --> 00:13:45,455

make some shit up and that's it

385
00:13:57,635 --> 00:13:59,225
that seems like a way in right

386
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:01,470
yeah go ahead make your million dollars

387
00:14:01,475 --> 00:14:02,015
yeah here

388
00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:04,985
on camera oh my dad like called

389
00:14:04,985 --> 00:14:06,155
me into the room to show me

390
00:14:06,155 --> 00:14:08,519
the news honey come in here honestly

391
00:14:08,525 --> 00:14:09,396
he's like oh i'm sorry i'm having

392
00:14:09,396 --> 00:14:10,625
a go like this and then it

393
00:14:10,625 --> 00:14:12,695
was about that guy from the office

394
00:14:12,695 --> 00:14:13,925
making a million dollars on candy and

395
00:14:13,925 --> 00:14:16,175
then i explained cameo in all of

396
00:14:16,175 --> 00:14:18,095
it's glory to my dad for ten

397
00:14:18,095 --> 00:14:20,975
minutes and then that was it i

398
00:14:20,975 --> 00:14:22,265
think that you shouldn't be able

399
00:14:22,295 --> 00:14:24,515
to replay cameos for anyone who didn't

400
00:14:24,515 --> 00:14:25,865
buy i agree and i don't think

401
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:28,235
the cameo should be on the cameo

402
00:14:28,235 --> 00:14:29,735
page of the person because you can

403
00:14:29,735 --> 00:14:31,055
watch it you can actually

404
00:14:32,105 --> 00:14:33,845
don't like that and it's so it's

405
00:14:33,845 --> 00:14:35,795
so weird yeah it takes away the

406
00:14:35,795 --> 00:14:37,685
specialness first of all and then it

407
00:14:37,685 --> 00:14:39,185
takes with it surprise and also some

408
00:14:39,185 --> 00:14:40,535
people do the exact same thing every

409
00:14:40,535 --> 00:14:43,085
time yeah um my friend did get

410
00:14:43,085 --> 00:14:45,305
one from someone from ninety day fiance

411
00:14:45,305 --> 00:14:46,655
and she sent it to me and

412
00:14:46,655 --> 00:14:49,565
it was so bizarre as um this

413
00:14:49,565 --> 00:14:51,665
guy paul wait actually we were going

414
00:14:51,665 --> 00:14:52,205
to talk about ninety

415
00:14:52,295 --> 00:14:53,525
fiance than someone so we didn't get

416
00:14:53,525 --> 00:14:54,875
into it and then oh okay go

417
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:56,135
ahead and get into it will do

418
00:14:56,135 --> 00:14:57,905
either of you watch it no no

419
00:14:58,055 --> 00:14:59,375
maybe that's why we didn't guess probably

420
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:02,795
why why the conversation dead end fast

421
00:15:03,215 --> 00:15:06,035
anyway there is a character aka person

422
00:15:06,035 --> 00:15:10,115
named paul who is married to this

423
00:15:10,115 --> 00:15:11,495
woman carine and they now are about

424
00:15:11,495 --> 00:15:12,425
to have their second child

425
00:15:12,425 --> 00:15:15,665
child and their relationship is very interesting

426
00:15:15,665 --> 00:15:18,335
but he um he's a very weird

427
00:15:18,335 --> 00:15:21,065
guy he ah he did an eleven

428
00:15:21,065 --> 00:15:23,465
minute cameo for my friend and she

429
00:15:23,495 --> 00:15:25,535
did a full tour of his house

430
00:15:25,565 --> 00:15:28,115
and someone like andy kindler do like

431
00:15:28,115 --> 00:15:30,305
hour long ones just to be funny

432
00:15:30,395 --> 00:15:31,745
about it or something like that i

433
00:15:31,745 --> 00:15:32,525
wouldn't be surprised

434
00:15:32,615 --> 00:15:33,755
but that feels like a waste of

435
00:15:33,755 --> 00:15:36,785
time for who him yeah but that's

436
00:15:36,965 --> 00:15:39,335
the joke i think if you were

437
00:15:39,335 --> 00:15:40,385
to say the person watching it i

438
00:15:40,385 --> 00:15:41,195
would agree as well

439
00:15:43,355 --> 00:15:44,555
i mean that's interesting i don't know

440
00:15:44,555 --> 00:15:46,415
so i appreciated that he went on

441
00:15:46,415 --> 00:15:48,455
for eleven minutes because it's like good

442
00:15:48,455 --> 00:15:51,035
value for fifty bucks but also it

443
00:15:51,035 --> 00:15:53,465
was just like wow he really did

444
00:15:53,465 --> 00:15:54,635
a whole he shared a lot of

445
00:15:54,635 --> 00:15:56,855
personal i saw his whole home that's

446
00:15:56,855 --> 00:15:57,965
why there's a french fry in the

447
00:15:57,965 --> 00:15:59,135
bed and he didn't take it out

448
00:15:59,135 --> 00:16:01,745
why yeah the idea you don't even

449
00:16:01,745 --> 00:16:02,525
know i can't

450
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:04,325
any you don't even know it's it's

451
00:16:04,325 --> 00:16:06,065
too it's like an understand the french

452
00:16:06,065 --> 00:16:07,325
frying the bed but not taking it

453
00:16:07,355 --> 00:16:09,005
oh yeah you know i legit you

454
00:16:09,005 --> 00:16:10,925

he went to visit her and she

456
00:16:13,145 --> 00:16:17,045
lived i wanna say the amazon it

457
00:16:17,045 --> 00:16:19,235
was truly like a very difficult place

458
00:16:19,235 --> 00:16:21,515
to get to amazon island he had

459
00:16:21,515 --> 00:16:22,745
to go to work

460
00:16:22,805 --> 00:16:24,725
oh walk through water at a certain

461
00:16:24,725 --> 00:16:26,045
point in his journey okay

462
00:16:27,095 --> 00:16:28,865
to get to her and

463
00:16:30,676 --> 00:16:34,145
some proclaimers shi'i yeah he put on

464
00:16:34,145 --> 00:16:37,415
two condoms on venus just to get

465
00:16:37,415 --> 00:16:40,415
to mosquitoes or bugs in the water

466
00:16:40,415 --> 00:16:42,995
would go in his penis oh and

467
00:16:42,995 --> 00:16:44,431
then in the cameo he made for

468
00:16:44,431 --> 00:16:47,045
my friend he showed his penis sheath

469
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:48,245
which i guess now he has a

470
00:16:48,245 --> 00:16:50,105
penis sheath instead of condoms

471
00:16:50,135 --> 00:16:52,085
for that base which long just move

472
00:16:52,085 --> 00:16:53,885
out they went to america then they

473
00:16:53,885 --> 00:16:55,235
went back i don't know they've had

474
00:16:55,235 --> 00:16:56,375
a lot going on but so he

475
00:16:56,375 --> 00:16:57,995
has a full penis sheath and he

476
00:16:57,995 --> 00:16:59,405
was like keep it on this on

477
00:16:59,405 --> 00:17:01,385
this structure keeps it keeps it straight

478
00:17:01,385 --> 00:17:03,479
i want to cause his penis he's

479
00:17:03,479 --> 00:17:04,715
sure i'm sure he picked it up

480
00:17:04,715 --> 00:17:06,335
when he showed this little nub

481
00:17:08,195 --> 00:17:09,995
and there was a sheath on it

482
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:13,565
and apparently he keeps it stretched out

483
00:17:13,565 --> 00:17:15,785
on that nub and it's like a

484
00:17:15,785 --> 00:17:16,325
shoe tree

485
00:17:19,235 --> 00:17:20,945
i'm just so fascinated but that's that's

486
00:17:20,945 --> 00:17:21,995
part of the thing with cameo it's

487
00:17:21,995 --> 00:17:23,795
like there's some irony to these a

488
00:17:23,795 --> 00:17:25,445
lot of these purchases which um you

489
00:17:25,445 --> 00:17:27,035
know yeah you know he doesn't carry

490
00:17:27,035 --> 00:17:29,075
slugging money well we were looking at

491
00:17:29,315 --> 00:17:31,355
christmas time and there were and i

492

494
00:17:36,335 --> 00:17:37,625
some clauses on cameo

495
00:17:37,655 --> 00:17:40,055
yeah many times i gotta get one

496
00:17:40,205 --> 00:17:41,795
many times but there weren't so there

497
00:17:41,795 --> 00:17:43,445
was like what you'd expect there were

498
00:17:43,445 --> 00:17:45,755
guys that like had real beards and

499
00:17:45,815 --> 00:17:48,065
obviously this is the they do this

500
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:50,975
you know every year yeah then there

501
00:17:50,975 --> 00:17:52,805

up and down as he talked it

then they'll guess how like how much

520
00:18:34,595 --> 00:18:37,085
it is and then talk about whether

521
00:18:37,085 --> 00:18:38,105
it's worth it and

522
00:18:38,169 --> 00:18:39,395

523
00:18:39,395 --> 00:18:41,975

like three hundred dollars and then they'll

531
00:18:53,165 --> 00:18:54,065

yourself well that's the thing i think

901
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:09,320
that we should have fake

902
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:11,900
ah not funerals but i guess funerals

903
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:13,850
or wakes or whatever for people in

904
00:32:13,850 --> 00:32:16,400
the community week because they're always so

905
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,530
touching you know when one of your

906
00:32:18,530 --> 00:32:19,730
friends dies and you hear all these

907
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:21,170
nice things and how much they mean

908
00:32:21,170 --> 00:32:23,060
to people and it's like yeah there's

909
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,890
the opposite as well what do you

910
00:32:24,890 --> 00:32:26,390
mean you hear well hear loud shit

911
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:29,690
talking during during awake yeah

912
00:32:29,690 --> 00:32:31,250
yeah really well the ones i've been

913
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:33,650
to like who your mom who lets

914
00:32:33,650 --> 00:32:34,160
see yeah

915
00:32:35,810 --> 00:32:37,130
savage takedown

916
00:32:41,870 --> 00:32:43,430
anyway but isn't that a good idea

917
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:45,020
to have a fake funeral for people

918
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:46,910
yes i do will have a usb

919
00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:51,410
sunset comedians can't be serious during yeah

920
00:32:51,410 --> 00:32:53,630
i know like the the reason it's

921
00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:55,580
so touching when they're dead is because

922
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:57,080
they are so serious it's like this

923
00:32:57,110 --> 00:32:58,490
yeah this very funny

924
00:32:58,520 --> 00:32:59,810
person is so serious now i guess

925
00:32:59,810 --> 00:33:00,920
weddings are sort of like that but

926
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,510
you know like there's nothing in between

927
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:04,250
a wedding and that's why like club

928
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:05,990
keeps saying like let's renew our vows

929
00:33:05,990 --> 00:33:07,250
because she just want a big party

930
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:09,110
where we say nice things to each

931
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:10,340
other in front of people you know

932
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:11,780
that you know i want to do

933
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:13,340
that too and genie's against it but

934
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:15,320
i wanna what i wanna do is

935
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:17,180
because as your life goes on you

936
00:33:17,210 --> 00:33:18,650
there are more people in your life

937
00:33:18,650 --> 00:33:20,870
life that weren't there when you got

938
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:22,520
married you know what i mean we

939
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:23,840
have to agree on this just for

940
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:26,780
the spanking category mutt idea i knew

941
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:28,130
bullets should do it and i think

942
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,750
it should be the second we're going

943
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:30,920
to have a party we have a

944
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:34,040
big yeah vow renewal wherever we're like

945
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:35,660
everyone we know and we just go

946
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:38,660
through and align everyone we know yes

947
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:42,260
everyone we've ever even spoken to like

948
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:44,720
matt once yeah even people on tour

949
00:33:44,810 --> 00:33:46,430
who have come through the lines wow

00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:48,230
they're all here they're all you're all

951
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:50,540
invited um would you do it at

952
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:52,070
your house it's your favorite checker from

953
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:55,070
the supermarket i've a friend who keeps

954
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:58,370
making excuses to like have a big

955
00:33:58,370 --> 00:33:58,940
party

956
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:01,340
every year and i think it's just

957
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:03,563
they like the attention it's like this

958
00:34:03,627 --> 00:34:05,660
people like what are what are so

959
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:08,420
like excuses well you know it started

960
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:10,460
with a wedding and then it like

961
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:13,340
it just keeps changing of like okay

962
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:14,840
now we're doing this thing and this

963
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,340
is where people say nice things about

964
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:19,130
me and yeah a lot that's amazing

965
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:21,410
saying yeah and every time it happens

966
00:34:21,410 --> 00:34:22,820
i'm a little suspect of like you

967
00:34:22,850 --> 00:34:25,700
just like people lining up and giving

968
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:28,070
you tribute usually you could only have

969
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:30,860
that that type of event where like

970
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:32,000
i i've been to a birthday party

971
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,560
where people got up and said things

972
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:35,780
about the person and everyone around the

973
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:37,940
table had to say something which makes

974
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:39,290
me really emotional like and not

975
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,280
a good way like i feel very

976
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:42,290
like i feel like cetera i feel

977
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:44,600
stressed and i feel like i cry

978
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:46,908
like because i can't believe it's out

979
00:34:46,908 --> 00:34:47,990
you have to do it well you

980
00:34:47,990 --> 00:34:50,090
see this is this is you though

981
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:51,620
i've learned about you you don't like

982
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:52,850
being put on the spot like this

983
00:34:52,850 --> 00:34:54,110
in a big i don't and it

984
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:55,880
makes me really uncomfortable if you had

985
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,710
to prepare would it be okay or

986
00:34:57,710 --> 00:34:59,300
is it no i've been thinking about

987
00:34:59,300 --> 00:34:59,450
it all

988
00:34:59,450 --> 00:35:00,680
all day it's like i just don't

989
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:02,450
want to do it and i but

990
00:35:02,450 --> 00:35:03,740
i but i don't mind saying something

991
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:05,570
nice i think it's not hard to

992
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:06,710
think of what i would say but

993
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:07,640
i just don't want to do it

994
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:10,820
but the problem is like how do

995
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:12,590
you get like my feeling is you

996
00:35:12,590 --> 00:35:15,380
can only do that once every five

997
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:18,830
yes or events like i don't want

998
00:35:18,830 --> 00:35:19,580
to get up every

999
00:35:19,610 --> 00:35:22,070
year in year like what's changed nothing

1000
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:24,380
and it just feels like self-absorbed like

1001
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:26,030
oh who wants to sit there and

1002
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:29,270

i would have done i really enjoyed

1070
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:38,660
your sort of big band version of

1071
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:40,100

1072
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:41,180

1297
00:46:02,850 --> 00:46:04,530
i can remember you throwing out numbers

1298
00:46:04,770 --> 00:46:05,820
i think they were fifty cents for

1299
00:46:05,820 --> 00:46:06,720
most my child and then they were

1300
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:09,390

1301
00:46:09,390 --> 00:46:10,800

1310
00:46:25,290 --> 00:46:27,000
what it was it was melted cheese

00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:29,310
inside i want to throw inside a

1312
00:46:29,310 --> 00:46:31,080

1313
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:31,830

1331
00:47:13,110 --> 00:47:14,490
that's that doesn't sound bad to have

1332
00:47:14,490 --> 00:47:15,960
like american cheese in the middle of

1333
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:17,576
like scrapple and stuff like that but

1334
00:47:17,576 --> 00:47:20,280
that's that's a good usage perfect i

1335
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:21,960
really wish i liked cooking i really

1336
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:23,580
don't care about which i did too

1337
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:25,650
so annoying janey loves it but i

1338
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:27,780
don't mean he loves it such a

1339
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:30,720
pain i don't have any ideas like

1340
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:31,770
i don't know how to do it

1341
00:47:31,770 --> 00:47:33,150
like i don't know what goes where

1342
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:35,047
like look something up online i've done

1343
00:47:35,070 --> 00:47:36,240
respite i had a period like i

1344
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:37,140
had appear at a time you would

1345
00:47:37,140 --> 00:47:39,810
appear last have a period like last

1346
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:40,320
year i had

1347
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:43,560
when i was like really cooking out

1348
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:47,250
of a recipe book cookbook and i

1349
00:47:47,250 --> 00:47:48,840
was like ah planning it like i'd

1350
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:50,078
open the cookbook and pick a thing

1351
00:47:50,078 --> 00:47:51,390
and then go get all but part

1352
00:47:51,390 --> 00:47:53,610
of the problem is that especially now

1353
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:55,560
you have to get so many ingredients

1354
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:56,700
if you're not someone who cooks a

1355
00:47:56,700 --> 00:47:57,930
lot like you have to buy so

1356
00:47:57,930 --> 00:47:59,940
many things we have everything stocked here

1357
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:01,590
because cool up for some reason

1358
00:48:01,620 --> 00:48:03,480
like keeps all that so we have

1359
00:48:03,510 --> 00:48:05,579
like everything you would ever want wow

1360
00:48:05,580 --> 00:48:07,440
full stocks like pantry and stuff like

1361
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:09,180
that so when i started making cakes

1362
00:48:09,180 --> 00:48:10,800
it was like i would look at

1363
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:13,230
the ingredients ago we can't possibly have

1364
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:15,540
this right gahanna all right here we

1365
00:48:15,540 --> 00:48:18,510
don't have what does this floor slower

1366
00:48:18,990 --> 00:48:21,240
the company my dad flew helicopters for

1367
00:48:21,750 --> 00:48:22,440
more fluor

1368
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:24,690
but i just wish i had a

1369
00:48:24,690 --> 00:48:28,890
chef yeah see that's where this is

1370
00:48:28,890 --> 00:48:30,480
headed now we'll just we'll get there

1371
00:48:30,510 --> 00:48:31,769
just to go like my ex is

1372
00:48:31,769 --> 00:48:34,920
my hook not really and we yeah

1373
00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:37,980
we we don't give up so early

1374
00:48:38,010 --> 00:48:38,280
okay

1375
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:42,180
but we like we both don't really

1376
00:48:42,390 --> 00:48:45,120
care to try right right so it's

1377
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:46,710
not really like i've done a lot

1378
00:48:46,710 --> 00:48:48,768
of those hello fresh type things yeah

1379
00:48:49,086 --> 00:48:50,880
podcast they send you like a box

1380
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:52,170
and yeah yeah so i've gotten like

1381
00:48:52,170 --> 00:48:53,340
a bunch of those over the years

1382
00:48:53,340 --> 00:48:55,980
and i do those but like that's

1383
00:48:55,980 --> 00:48:57,990
really specific like the it's hard because

1384
00:48:57,990 --> 00:48:59,640
it's just like i that i make

1385
00:48:59,670 --> 00:49:01,470
that thing but then i won't probably

1386
00:49:01,470 --> 00:49:02,550
make it again because then i had

1387
00:49:02,550 --> 00:49:03,690
to get all that stuff again what

1388
00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:05,970
have you started small with stuff that's

1389
00:49:05,970 --> 00:49:07,650
kind of basic and then like that's

1390
00:49:07,650 --> 00:49:08,760

1468
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:58,190
i just eat raw beef

1469
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:01,656
but i think about my mom making

1470
00:52:02,090 --> 00:52:02,390
noise

1471
00:52:03,950 --> 00:52:05,480
alright let's have a moment of silence

1472
00:52:05,480 --> 00:52:06,560
where we all think about my mom

1473
00:52:07,550 --> 00:52:10,460
um but but making dishes you know

1474
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:12,320
because she she got married right out

1475
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:14,000
of high school right and so she

1476
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:15,230
became a housewife and she wanted to

1477
00:52:15,230 --> 00:52:16,460
be a housewife because you want to

1478
00:52:16,460 --> 00:52:17,600
get out of the house so that's

1479
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:19,160
what society told her shining on which

1480
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:21,050
house curb she grew up in a

1481
00:52:21,050 --> 00:52:23,660
which house she wants to claim oh

1482
00:52:23,660 --> 00:52:25,580
boy drops because she wanted to get

1483
00:52:25,580 --> 00:52:26,450
out of the house but then she

1484
00:52:26,450 --> 00:52:27,350
had to go in that she got

1485
00:52:27,350 --> 00:52:27,590
to go

1486
00:52:27,620 --> 00:52:28,880
into a different house my house is

1487
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:30,050
made of food i gotta get out

1488
00:52:30,050 --> 00:52:31,370
of here but she had to learn

1489
00:52:31,370 --> 00:52:32,840
how to be a housewife and essentially

1490
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:34,580
my dad like you know went off

1491
00:52:34,580 --> 00:52:36,320
to the war in vietnam like right

1492
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:37,550
when they got married so she was

1493
00:52:37,550 --> 00:52:39,590
like and had had a baby with

1494
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:41,630
like the worst and so had had

1495
00:52:41,630 --> 00:52:43,070
a baby or know how to do

1496
00:52:43,070 --> 00:52:45,440
it and had had like help from

1497
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:47,480
relatives sort of but she learned how

1498
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:47,780
you know

1499
00:52:47,780 --> 00:52:49,010
no like i grew up going like

1500
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:51,050
my mom's cooking is like she she

1501
00:52:51,050 --> 00:52:52,700
was very good at desserts but like

1502
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:54,650
we have this kind of the same

1503
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:57,140
seven things you say mean things but

1504
00:52:57,140 --> 00:52:59,750
then you realize the internet isn't around

1505
00:52:59,750 --> 00:53:01,730
and all she had was like one

1506
00:53:01,730 --> 00:53:04,610
cookbook that that someone had bought her

1507
00:53:04,610 --> 00:53:06,611
when she first became wives cool yeah

1508
00:53:06,658 --> 00:53:07,820
it was like essentially like

1509
00:53:07,940 --> 00:53:11,090
american cooking that's so basic and so

1510
00:53:11,090 --> 00:53:12,860
she learned how to do food men

1511
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:15,710
love yeah she would like experiment occasionally

1512
00:53:15,710 --> 00:53:16,700
but if it didn't get a good

1513
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:21,380
response from ah from the canvas early

1514
00:53:21,380 --> 00:53:23,630
on he's looking for someone he's like

1515
00:53:23,630 --> 00:53:26,750
a vasan lawn helicopter but there's also

1516
00:53:26,750 --> 00:53:28,100
a big lie

1517
00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:29,570
like squirrel or something on that fence

1518
00:53:29,870 --> 00:53:31,820
in any case or some fans are

1519
00:53:31,820 --> 00:53:34,460
pointing yeah yeah okay now it's right

1520
00:53:34,460 --> 00:53:35,390
side up so i can tell it's

1521
00:53:35,390 --> 00:53:36,560
a squirrel but it was upside down

1522
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:37,820
for awhile um it's on top of

1523
00:53:37,820 --> 00:53:40,820
that fence up there i see but

1524
00:53:40,820 --> 00:53:42,830

1525
00:53:42,830 --> 00:53:44,480
out how to do the seven things

1526
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:46,280

do it every year i'd say how

1589
00:55:49,370 --> 00:55:50,720

00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:52,850
questions every year and now the exact

1591
00:55:52,850 --> 00:55:54,274

00:56:03,230 --> 00:56:05,030
the day or the minute after we

1601
00:56:10,580 --> 00:56:12,590
not related to christmas okay but it's

1602
00:56:12,590 --> 00:56:14,660

1870
01:06:52,095 --> 01:06:53,535
like christopher reeve but then once you

1871
01:06:53,535 --> 01:06:55,545
get on it's like fine so i

1872
01:06:55,545 --> 01:06:57,255
went i did it at summer camp

1873
01:06:57,255 --> 01:06:59,715
for like literally ten minutes they do

1874
01:06:59,745 --> 01:07:00,705
they just put you on a horse

1875
01:07:00,705 --> 01:07:02,505
may lead you around oh but i

1876
01:07:02,505 --> 01:07:04,005
remember as a kid it was scary

1877
01:07:04,185 --> 01:07:05,715
because you feel so high up yes

1878
01:07:05,715 --> 01:07:06,945
but i just did it like five

1879
01:07:06,975 --> 01:07:08,445
years ago and it was fun i

1880
01:07:08,445 --> 01:07:09,765
guess i haven't ridden a horse and

1881
01:07:09,825 --> 01:07:12,045
a long time i feel weird about

1882
01:07:12,045 --> 01:07:13,935
it like there because there's trails here

1883
01:07:13,965 --> 01:07:15,135
where you can go and do it

1884
01:07:15,255 --> 01:07:17,355
right but there's like a one on

1885
01:07:17,355 --> 01:07:18,555
the one hand i really would like

1886
01:07:18,555 --> 01:07:19,995
to do it but the other hand

1887
01:07:19,995 --> 01:07:21,435
it feels weird to do that to

1888
01:07:21,435 --> 01:07:23,025
a while i think i've said this

1889
01:07:23,025 --> 01:07:24,615
before i don't know if i've said

1890
01:07:24,615 --> 01:07:26,475

1893
01:07:29,955 --> 01:07:31,755

women get rich they get into horses

1895
01:07:33,525 --> 01:07:34,963

give a child an unusual name i

1909

1910
01:08:06,615 --> 01:08:08,805

1911
01:08:08,895 --> 01:08:12,615

01:08:29,865 --> 01:08:31,035
it i feel like it's a thing

1921
01:08:31,035 --> 01:08:32,385
that i've made fun of but then

1922
01:08:32,385 --> 01:08:33,315

1923
01:08:33,345 --> 01:08:35,505

1945
01:09:19,245 --> 01:09:21,201

1946
01:09:21,201 --> 01:09:22,665
i knew it wasn't me and i

1947
01:09:22,695 --> 01:09:24,495
didn't think it was utah because of

1948
01:09:24,555 --> 01:09:25,771
the fact that you're early to every

1949
01:09:25,785 --> 01:09:27,915
bar never makes me late to parties

1950
01:09:28,275 --> 01:09:30,563
oh mike does he prefers to be

1951
01:09:30,563 --> 01:09:33,105

1952
01:09:33,105 --> 01:09:34,755

1954
01:09:38,085 --> 01:09:40,605
so chill he's very chill okay so

1955
01:09:40,605 --> 01:09:41,745
who is the most likely to jump

1956
01:09:41,745 --> 01:09:42,915
out of an airplane

1957
01:09:44,295 --> 01:09:45,765
paul i said but i don't think

1958
01:09:45,765 --> 01:09:47,475
any of us would i said lauren

1959
01:09:47,475 --> 01:09:48,975
because i don't think mere paul would

1960
01:09:49,155 --> 01:09:50,805
i said aquaman because i didn't know

1961
01:09:50,805 --> 01:09:53,415
who i am last i don't know

1962
01:09:53,655 --> 01:09:55,395
i just wrote it that way i

1963
01:09:55,395 --> 01:09:57,615
don't think any of the sciences that's

1964
01:09:57,675 --> 01:09:59,175
why none of us would also because

1965
01:09:59,175 --> 01:10:00,675
of your contact the way you have

1966
01:10:00,675 --> 01:10:02,865
your contact card in your name always

1967
01:10:02,865 --> 01:10:04,191
capitalizes oh

1968
01:10:04,305 --> 01:10:06,225
when i write a hocker minute automatic

1969
01:10:06,255 --> 01:10:07,785
capital it does on mine too because

1970
01:10:07,875 --> 01:10:09,006
i don't know because i tell you

1971
01:10:09,015 --> 01:10:11,835

1972
01:10:11,835 --> 01:10:14,745
the least afraid of spiders i said

1973
01:10:14,745 --> 01:10:17,265
scott i just got to i said

1974
01:10:17,595 --> 01:10:20,145

crazy and and then a person went

1984
01:10:42,735 --> 01:10:44,535

not happy about it i will say

2014
01:11:36,750 --> 01:11:38,280
bringing up costa rica again when we

2015
01:11:38,280 --> 01:11:40,200

2016
01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:44,160
was going to the beach and when

2017
01:11:44,160 --> 01:11:46,410
we were there there are i think

2018
01:11:47,010 --> 01:11:49,020
basically crickets in your room and your

2019
01:11:49,020 --> 01:11:49,500
hotel room

2020
01:11:49,500 --> 01:11:50,550
room all the time and they're up

2021
01:11:50,550 --> 01:11:51,660
on the ceiling and all that and

2022
01:11:51,660 --> 01:11:53,100
you just have to accept it that's

2023
01:11:53,100 --> 01:11:54,150
a feature and a bug

2024
01:11:55,260 --> 01:11:57,120
you get a mesh net around your

2025
01:11:57,180 --> 01:11:58,740
know and i was just kinda like

2026
01:11:58,770 --> 01:12:00,570
okay well i guess this is just

2027
01:12:00,570 --> 01:12:03,840
part of it but don't it's a

2028
01:12:03,840 --> 01:12:06,870
little unsettling and i just have this

2029
01:12:06,870 --> 01:12:08,940
image of me watching doctor who on

2030
01:12:08,940 --> 01:12:11,400
my bed while they're like crickets everywhere

01:12:39,210 --> 01:12:41,040
that i would and i do take

2044
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:43,260

really smart and offered to skip grades

2119
01:15:19,500 --> 01:15:22,620
but then when they started giving homework

2120
01:15:22,740 --> 01:15:24,960
when i was ten or eleven i

2121
01:15:25,050 --> 01:15:26,760
instantly became bad at school because i

2122
01:15:26,760 --> 01:15:28,860
hate homework yeah like hate any kind

2123
01:15:28,860 --> 01:15:31,530
of like assignment or being told i

2124
01:15:31,530 --> 01:15:32,640
had to do stuff it's like let

2125
01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:34,620
me learn this shit in class homo

2126
01:15:34,620 --> 01:15:36,750
work is weird it's a weird concept

2127
01:15:36,750 --> 01:15:38,700
like you're there so long in school

2128
01:15:38,700 --> 01:15:40,740
you should be able to accomplish everything

2129
01:15:40,740 --> 01:15:42,030
while you're there i never thought about

2130
01:15:42,030 --> 01:15:43,860
until i was well out of school

2131
01:15:43,860 --> 01:15:46,980
and hearing a parents talk about it

2132
01:15:48,090 --> 01:15:49,350
and maybe some teachers i don't know

2133
01:15:49,350 --> 01:15:51,510
but the idea of like abolishing homework

2134
01:15:51,510 --> 01:15:52,230
like yeah

2135
01:15:53,340 --> 01:15:57,180
seems like kind of um classes because

2136
01:15:57,630 --> 01:15:59,970
not everyone can do this stuff at

2137
01:15:59,970 --> 01:16:01,530
home and everyone has the time the

2138
01:16:01,530 --> 01:16:03,420
resources and all that kinda stuff you

2139
01:16:03,420 --> 01:16:05,040
can fall behind because you can't do

2140
01:16:05,040 --> 01:16:06,390
that but you do it all while

2141
01:16:06,390 --> 01:16:07,470
you're there like when we go to

2142
01:16:07,470 --> 01:16:10,440
work um you're there for eight hours

2143
01:16:10,440 --> 01:16:11,580
or the same amount of time you're

2144
01:16:11,580 --> 01:16:13,110
at school you're not then like taking

2145
01:16:13,110 --> 01:16:13,500
