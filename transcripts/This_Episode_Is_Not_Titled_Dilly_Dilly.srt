show wiener bill that was on nickelodeon

143
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:19,980
in the early nineties and it was

144
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:21,600
when i thought you might know it

145
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,330
because it was i'm assuming a comedian

146
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:25,856
who did the show like a a

147
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:26,160
man

148
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,730
man and he would be the it

149
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:31,770
would be his head when you were

150
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:33,030
describing the puppet that your dad made

151
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:34,410
me think of this okay it was

152
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,300
it would be his head and then

153
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,650
like a little body like he'd be

154
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:39,210
like a puppet of himself as nick

155
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:40,770
well i don't know the name of

156
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:42,630
the guy his name was mark wiener

157
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:44,580
oh okay i know the comedian is

158
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,780

00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:46,320
the show interesting

160
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:47,520

162
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:51,210

me on the mister show's yeah he

165
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:57,450

this yeah like a little table and

167
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:00,120
then you would put because i think

he did this as a street performer

169
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:03,180

little sort of black box on the

171
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:06,480
stage where he would make his fist

it so much and now everyone says

303
00:10:42,925 --> 00:10:45,355

306
00:10:50,935 --> 00:10:52,045

307
00:10:52,045 --> 00:10:54,685
wishes you could write commercial job

308

i feel i think that would be

309
00:10:57,595 --> 00:10:59,275
miserable it would be i just feel

310
00:10:59,275 --> 00:11:00,055
like i could do it so much

311
00:11:00,055 --> 00:11:01,375
better i but i think we're at

312
00:11:01,375 --> 00:11:02,605
this point now where no one thinks

313
00:11:02,815 --> 00:11:05,215
oh well i could go at this

314
00:11:05,215 --> 00:11:07,105
point where they just show you the

315
00:11:07,105 --> 00:11:08,965
most random thing just to get your

316
00:11:08,965 --> 00:11:10,135
attention it has nothing to do with

317
00:11:10,135 --> 00:11:11,995
anything it's totally rent and i have

318
00:11:11,995 --> 00:11:14,125

419
00:14:29,005 --> 00:14:30,925
when i was watching a commercial i

420
00:14:30,925 --> 00:14:32,515
was like wow

421
00:14:32,785 --> 00:14:34,765

422
00:14:34,765 --> 00:14:36,685

paul finish the story daily news oh

426
00:14:42,655 --> 00:14:45,655
they're silly it sounds recounting the commercial

427
00:14:45,685 --> 00:14:47,515
telling right story

428
00:14:49,075 --> 00:14:50,455
he didn't believe me

429
00:14:51,655 --> 00:14:52,585
but if you are a dad and

430
00:14:52,585 --> 00:14:54,205
you only told like good night stories

431
00:14:55,315 --> 00:14:57,565
just three counts those were all medieval

432
00:14:57,565 --> 00:14:59,905
fucking old team okay so this brown

433
00:14:59,905 --> 00:15:00,235
guy

434
00:15:03,085 --> 00:15:05,215
so how's so so re frogged on

435
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:05,665
a brand

436
00:15:07,045 --> 00:15:09,085
so someone brings about my head away

437
00:15:09,085 --> 00:15:10,735
and they'll say that's the a dilly

438
00:15:10,735 --> 00:15:12,355
dilly well he doesn't bring enough for

439
00:15:12,355 --> 00:15:14,575
the everybody or something like that and

440
00:15:14,575 --> 00:15:16,195
so he's beheaded or some shit but

441
00:15:16,195 --> 00:15:17,515
what's weird about the commercial is you

442
00:15:17,515 --> 00:15:19,975
feel like in the commercial this is

443
00:15:19,975 --> 00:15:22,315
a reference to something else right and

444
00:15:22,315 --> 00:15:23,875
i die read an article about it

445
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:25,135
and they just buried up for this

446
00:15:25,135 --> 00:15:26,365
just made up for that they they

447
00:15:26,365 --> 00:15:26,995
do admit

448
00:15:26,995 --> 00:15:28,225

449
00:15:28,225 --> 00:15:30,145

it was just made up for that

452
00:15:33,955 --> 00:15:34,855

453
00:15:34,855 --> 00:15:37,315

568
00:19:23,005 --> 00:19:25,285
this for years the bachelor should be

569
00:19:25,615 --> 00:19:27,145
every season to be a brand new

570
00:19:27,145 --> 00:19:28,195
person who's never been on the show

571
00:19:28,195 --> 00:19:30,265
before there's no preconceived notions about what

572
00:19:30,265 --> 00:19:31,525
they're like or what they're into or

573
00:19:31,525 --> 00:19:32,665
what they did with the last person

574
00:19:33,025 --> 00:19:35,185

575
00:19:35,185 --> 00:19:37,195
who are ah of age or they

576
00:19:37,195 --> 00:19:39,385

00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:12,930
writing and then then very similar to

770
00:26:12,930 --> 00:26:14,490
real-world in my twenties i was like

771
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:14,700

the same like someone is twenty two

775
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:22,230
is the same someone who's thirty five

00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:23,580
not to interrupt people but he but

777
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:24,810
here's the thing yeah while i was

778
00:26:24,810 --> 00:26:28,080
watching this because i'm so far away

785
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,540
time because i'm looking at it from

786
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:41,400
this from the the the point of

787
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,660
view of like oh that twenty four

788
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:44,280
year old is taking advantage of that

789
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:47,070
seventeen year old yeah i and so

the standpoint of like oh no he

a conversation about someone dating a girl

811
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:37,470
who's eleven years younger than him and

812
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:39,810
the girl keeps questionnaire she's like seventeen

as long as you think it's fine

816
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:45,487

thinking about myself at that time though

821
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,960
and it was like to know what

822
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,280
i know now versus what i know

823
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:59,280
knew then and like the i i

824
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:01,440
had a couple sort of pseudo relationships

825
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:02,700
relationships people who are older

826
00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:04,590

833
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:19,110

838
00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:32,340
like down on my level of course

839
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:32,940

1090
00:37:16,515 --> 00:37:17,715
wait so but another

1091
00:37:17,745 --> 00:37:20,265
of the teacher he ran off with

1092
00:37:20,265 --> 00:37:21,375
the student it was a girl that

1093
00:37:21,375 --> 00:37:23,235
i went to this grade school was

1094
00:37:23,235 --> 00:37:24,315
what i was gonna say about you

1095
00:37:24,315 --> 00:37:26,355
and the twenty four year old and

1096
00:37:26,565 --> 00:37:27,945
there seems to be such a wide

1097
00:37:27,945 --> 00:37:31,365
swath of maturity but that movie it

1098
00:37:31,365 --> 00:37:32,685
didn't bother me call me by your

1099
00:37:32,685 --> 00:37:34,755
name because i don't think movies have

1100
00:37:34,755 --> 00:37:37,725
a responsibility to do the morally right

1101
00:37:37,725 --> 00:37:37,875
thing

1102
00:37:37,875 --> 00:37:39,225
and realise like i think it's less

1103
00:37:39,225 --> 00:37:41,205
like this this is the story that

1104
00:37:41,212 --> 00:37:43,185
happens yes story no i never felt

1105
00:37:43,185 --> 00:37:45,135
like the movie was at fault apr

1106
00:37:45,135 --> 00:37:46,815
is more like i didn't know how

1107
00:37:46,815 --> 00:37:48,465
to judge their religious yes it was

1108
00:37:48,465 --> 00:37:50,355
a thing well because it was always

1109
00:37:50,355 --> 00:37:51,585
this part of it you know what

1110
00:37:51,585 --> 00:37:53,385
i mean is it is the age

1111
00:37:53,385 --> 00:37:55,665
difference significant and is it part of

1112
00:37:55,665 --> 00:37:57,705
the story right and in a way

1113
00:37:57,705 --> 00:37:58,035
it is

1114
00:37:58,035 --> 00:37:59,355
is you know it's like but it's

1115
00:37:59,355 --> 00:38:02,415
it's more about you know this kid's

1116
00:38:02,565 --> 00:38:05,955
um you know experience and this um

1117
00:38:05,985 --> 00:38:09,105
this wonderful thing that happens it's like

1118
00:38:09,495 --> 00:38:11,565
that's romantic and it's sad and it's

1119
00:38:11,565 --> 00:38:13,185
frustrating and it's you know it's every

1120
00:38:13,185 --> 00:38:16,185
like lie it's like yeah but but

1121
00:38:16,185 --> 00:38:17,215
but i guess what i mean is

1122
00:38:17,215 --> 00:38:17,925
is there such

1123
00:38:18,195 --> 00:38:20,175
i've never quite understood that about like

1124
00:38:20,175 --> 00:38:23,385
teachers falling in love with students because

1125
00:38:23,835 --> 00:38:24,975
or at least until you get to

1126
00:38:24,975 --> 00:38:27,135
college because it doesn't seem like if

1127
00:38:27,135 --> 00:38:29,145
you're under eighteen well it's also what's

1128
00:38:29,145 --> 00:38:30,765
so crazy about it is it's the

1129
00:38:30,855 --> 00:38:33,215
one thing you absolutely are not supposed

1130
00:38:33,215 --> 00:38:34,665
i think that's like a lioness your

1131
00:38:34,665 --> 00:38:37,845
one job you had one job don't

1132
00:38:37,845 --> 00:38:38,355
fuck up

1133
00:38:39,315 --> 00:38:40,815
i know but i don't i think

1134
00:38:41,025 --> 00:38:42,675
to teach them i think about that

1135
00:38:42,675 --> 00:38:45,255
sometimes like relationships shop is not just

1136
00:38:45,375 --> 00:38:47,353
like fleece yeah can you get right

1137
00:38:47,353 --> 00:38:50,265
damn who cares if you just don't

1138
00:38:50,295 --> 00:38:50,505
fuck

1139
00:38:52,875 --> 00:38:54,285
but i think about relationships i had

1140
00:38:54,285 --> 00:38:56,055
in high school or whatever you know

1141
00:38:56,055 --> 00:38:58,333
like ah you know when i was

1142
00:38:58,333 --> 00:38:59,895
seventeen i was dating a sixteen year

1143
00:38:59,895 --> 00:39:02,685
old and it's like it's and you

1144
00:39:02,685 --> 00:39:05,325
think in in nowadays i go oh

1145
00:39:05,325 --> 00:39:06,975
is that weird though like to know

1146
00:39:06,975 --> 00:39:08,655
i said i think but when you're

1147
00:39:08,655 --> 00:39:10,815
a kid like and you're just it's

1148
00:39:10,845 --> 00:39:11,715
whoever is

1149
00:39:11,715 --> 00:39:13,215
is sort of at the same level

1150
00:39:13,215 --> 00:39:15,615
as you yeah but i think it's

1151
00:39:15,615 --> 00:39:17,295
not like if i were to see

1152
00:39:17,955 --> 00:39:19,785
if i would of saw thirty year

1153
00:39:19,785 --> 00:39:21,015
old i'd be like you're too old

1154
00:39:21,015 --> 00:39:22,605
for well it's just what's complicated i

1155
00:39:22,635 --> 00:39:24,795
think because when you see somebody in

1156
00:39:24,795 --> 00:39:26,775
a relationship like that and they act

1157
00:39:26,775 --> 00:39:28,725
like that's fine or whatever it's weird

1158
00:39:28,725 --> 00:39:31,305
because for me now i think that's

1159
00:39:31,305 --> 00:39:31,875
a child

1160
00:39:31,905 --> 00:39:33,825
like i'm thirty two and imo if

1161
00:39:33,825 --> 00:39:34,875
i'm gonna run a high school or

1162
00:39:34,875 --> 00:39:36,135
i'm like you're a little kid that

1163
00:39:36,135 --> 00:39:37,515
was my thing the idea of somebody

1164
00:39:37,515 --> 00:39:39,855
being into that yeah like dating you

1165
00:39:39,885 --> 00:39:41,805
on a peer level is confusing to

1166
00:39:41,805 --> 00:39:43,395
me and you don't but another because

1167
00:39:43,395 --> 00:39:45,675
i'm older than that even and i

1168
00:39:45,885 --> 00:39:48,345
want to know i'm thirty five years

1169
00:39:48,345 --> 00:39:50,115
old guy okay okay when i am

1170
00:39:50,385 --> 00:39:50,985
twenty nine

1171
00:39:53,415 --> 00:39:55,095
dilly dilly dally what do you want

1172
00:39:55,095 --> 00:39:56,325
scott are trying to bring back the

1173
00:39:56,355 --> 00:39:58,965
the jack benny lying about your age

1174
00:39:59,055 --> 00:39:59,595
jag

1175
00:40:01,305 --> 00:40:02,475
when i look at someone who's twenty

1176
00:40:02,475 --> 00:40:04,755
four i see that as so young

1177
00:40:04,755 --> 00:40:07,455
yeah so it's it was weird like

1178
00:40:07,695 --> 00:40:10,185
to to experience this movie where all

1179
00:40:10,185 --> 00:40:11,265
of us i but so much of

1180
00:40:11,265 --> 00:40:12,555
it i think was about the casting

1181
00:40:12,885 --> 00:40:14,865
because yeah it looks like such a

1182
00:40:14,895 --> 00:40:16,305
he looks like a middle aged man

1183
00:40:16,455 --> 00:40:18,465
like a great-looking mean i always thought

1184
00:40:18,465 --> 00:40:19,895
he was older than me like for

1185
00:40:19,935 --> 00:40:20,835
the last ten years

1186
00:40:20,865 --> 00:40:22,935
i'm surprised that way younger he's one

1187
00:40:22,935 --> 00:40:24,705
year young way you'll let me know

1188
00:40:25,215 --> 00:40:25,845
i sit next to him on a

1189
00:40:25,845 --> 00:40:27,885
plane across him armor

1190
00:40:29,375 --> 00:40:31,535
and like he's breathtaking input yeah did

you are offered a brain pill if

00:41:51,305 --> 00:41:53,315
you swallow this pill you will become

1228
00:41:53,375 --> 00:41:55,475
ten percent more intelligent than you currently

1229
00:41:55,475 --> 00:41:57,425
are you will be more adept at

1230
00:41:57,425 --> 00:41:57,695
reading

1231
00:41:57,726 --> 00:42:01,775
comprehension logic and critical thinking however to

00:42:01,775 --> 00:42:03,485
all other people you know and to

1233
00:42:03,485 --> 00:42:05,225
all future people you meet you will

1234
00:42:05,225 --> 00:42:08,285
seem twenty percent less intelligent in other

1235
00:42:08,285 --> 00:42:10,265
words you will immediately become smarter but

1236
00:42:10,265 --> 00:42:11,945
the rest of the world will perceive

1237
00:42:11,945 --> 00:42:13,265
you as dumber and there is no

1238
00:42:13,265 --> 00:42:14,975
way you can ever alter the universality

1239
00:42:14,975 --> 00:42:16,595
of that perception do you take this

1240
00:42:16,595 --> 00:42:16,895
pill

1241
00:42:18,035 --> 00:42:20,015
i think people think i'm dumb already

1242
00:42:20,105 --> 00:42:22,205

yeah i'm always mispronouncing words like look

1246
00:42:29,975 --> 00:42:31,685
you know i i do think about

1247
00:42:31,685 --> 00:42:34,445
this sometimes i remember george w bush

1248
00:42:34,835 --> 00:42:36,005
you know how you would have a

1249
00:42:36,005 --> 00:42:37,955
lot of ah sort of

1250
00:42:38,015 --> 00:42:39,905
brain farts on tv yeah say things

1251
00:42:39,905 --> 00:42:41,315
wrong or whatever no i was making

1252
00:42:41,315 --> 00:42:42,815
fun of that once my dad said

1253
00:42:43,505 --> 00:42:45,455
don't call him no um i said

1254
00:42:45,455 --> 00:42:48,455
yeah he said will you try talking

1255
00:42:48,455 --> 00:42:52,175
that much and you'll have those kind

1256
00:42:52,175 --> 00:42:53,555
of things too and then i was

1257
00:42:53,555 --> 00:42:55,385
like yeah okay whatever point but then

1258
00:42:55,385 --> 00:42:58,145
being having podcasts it's like

1259
00:42:58,205 --> 00:43:00,905
i'm constantly saying stupid shit yeah so

1260
00:43:00,905 --> 00:43:03,215
i have come to sort of empathize

1261
00:43:03,215 --> 00:43:05,945
with that but that's also a whole

1262
00:43:05,945 --> 00:43:07,175
lot of sex also my dumb brain

1263
00:43:07,334 --> 00:43:08,405
it's also your dumb brain but it's

1264
00:43:08,405 --> 00:43:10,385
all but that's there's a difference between

1265
00:43:10,385 --> 00:43:12,545
that kind of talking and you know

1266
00:43:12,545 --> 00:43:13,775
bull shitting on a podcast you know

messing up syntax of words and

1269
00:43:18,335 --> 00:43:20,945
or sentences yeah but i don't know

1270
00:43:20,945 --> 00:43:23,705

doubly talking about all the time it

1304
00:44:24,305 --> 00:44:25,895
was so weird though to hear i

1305
00:44:25,895 --> 00:44:27,305
thought i said something i was so

1306
00:44:27,305 --> 00:44:28,355
certain and then just to hear it

1307
00:44:28,355 --> 00:44:29,675
back and like that's not what i

1308
00:44:29,675 --> 00:44:30,995

i

1315
00:44:38,975 --> 00:44:40,985

1318
00:44:46,235 --> 00:44:47,975
know that and i said it several

1319
00:44:47,975 --> 00:44:51,425
times the incorrect way and um and

1320
00:44:51,425 --> 00:44:53,555
people started talking to me about it

1321
00:44:54,095 --> 00:44:55,955
assuming that i knew that i had

1322
00:44:55,955 --> 00:44:57,005
said the wrong thing and i didn't

1323
00:44:57,005 --> 00:44:58,091
i'm like what does everybody what are

1324
00:44:58,091 --> 00:44:59,135
these people saying are they

1325
00:44:59,165 --> 00:45:00,965
make vita me i had no idea

1326
00:45:00,965 --> 00:45:02,705
so weird i said the other day

1327
00:45:02,705 --> 00:45:05,135
um someone wondered what song was playing

1328
00:45:05,135 --> 00:45:06,335
and i said yeah and it was

1329
00:45:06,335 --> 00:45:08,465
the song can't stop the feeling and

1330
00:45:08,465 --> 00:45:09,635
i said oh it's can't fight the

1331
00:45:09,635 --> 00:45:11,465
feeling and she said yes that's it

1332
00:45:11,945 --> 00:45:13,775
and then all i could think about

1333
00:45:14,255 --> 00:45:16,625
was i said the wrong title to

1334
00:45:16,625 --> 00:45:19,295
this stranger she thinks i'm in it

1335
00:45:19,295 --> 00:45:21,605
idiot now because i said very confidently

1336
00:45:21,605 --> 00:45:23,435
it's catfight the feeling and i'm going

1337
00:45:23,435 --> 00:45:24,905
to remember this day for the rest

1338
00:45:24,905 --> 00:45:26,165
of my life huh

1339
00:45:26,255 --> 00:45:29,465
and you did i so wow she

1340
00:45:29,465 --> 00:45:31,355
i think that she she didn't notice

1341
00:45:31,355 --> 00:45:33,455
she she registered it as the correct

1342
00:45:33,455 --> 00:45:36,455
thing or higher or that was shot

1343
00:45:36,485 --> 00:45:38,075
early know and i know but it's

1344
00:45:38,075 --> 00:45:39,185
the kind of thing that i will

1345
00:45:39,185 --> 00:45:40,985
obsess about for the yeah well that's

1346
00:45:40,985 --> 00:45:42,815
weird i think i might like to

1347
00:45:42,815 --> 00:45:44,585
take the pill just to give it

1348
00:45:44,735 --> 00:45:46,175
all but forgotten think about the question

1349
00:45:46,445 --> 00:45:49,866
um because i think i feel like

1350
00:45:49,866 --> 00:45:52,115
it'd be so great to be able

1351
00:45:52,115 --> 00:45:53,975
to use i don't know and be

1352
00:45:53,975 --> 00:45:56,645
smarter than bill i feel like um

1353
00:45:57,635 --> 00:46:00,785
i'm assuming if i take the pill

1354
00:46:00,815 --> 00:46:04,205
that gives me more intelligence it will

1355
00:46:04,205 --> 00:46:06,575
also give him the ability to read

1356
00:46:06,575 --> 00:46:09,065
isn't out enough to not be upset

1357
00:46:09,155 --> 00:46:11,795
that every grey stupid because it would

1358
00:46:12,095 --> 00:46:13,505
i feel like it would that would

1359
00:46:13,505 --> 00:46:15,305
be over here getting frustrating i don't

1360
00:46:15,305 --> 00:46:16,715
care about my own personal knowledge i

1361
00:46:16,715 --> 00:46:18,635
care about what well that's things but

1362
00:46:18,635 --> 00:46:22,055
i for me it's like it's i

1363
00:46:22,085 --> 00:46:24,035
realised it would be less i think

1364
00:46:24,035 --> 00:46:25,715
because i'm a middle child it would

1365
00:46:25,715 --> 00:46:26,585
be less about

1366
00:46:27,005 --> 00:46:28,865
um what people thought about me but

1367
00:46:28,865 --> 00:46:30,575
that they wouldn't listen to me it

1368
00:46:30,575 --> 00:46:31,955
would be frustrating that i would be

1369
00:46:31,955 --> 00:46:35,105
perceived as someone whose opinion or input

1370
00:46:35,105 --> 00:46:38,165
did not matter matter tray looks like

1371
00:46:38,165 --> 00:46:39,815
i know i'm actually smarter than men

1372
00:46:39,815 --> 00:46:41,405
you wouldn't be able to use your

1373
00:46:41,405 --> 00:46:43,325
intelligence to help anyone does anything like

1374
00:46:43,325 --> 00:46:44,975
what do i do with that intelligence

1375
00:46:44,975 --> 00:46:46,565
if everyone assumes i'm an idiot did

1376
00:46:46,565 --> 00:46:46,835
you

1377
00:46:46,925 --> 00:46:48,575
could you write letters and people would

1378
00:46:48,575 --> 00:46:50,765
think they're smart like a progress report

1379
00:46:50,825 --> 00:46:52,265
or like just even a letter like

1380
00:46:52,265 --> 00:46:54,575
he's good on paper yeah i don't

1381
00:46:54,575 --> 00:46:56,166
know hey if you have to write

1382
00:46:56,166 --> 00:46:57,125
it anonymously

1383
00:46:57,755 --> 00:46:58,775
if you could go

1384
00:46:59,855 --> 00:47:01,505
got this letter ah but it's a

1385
00:47:01,508 --> 00:47:03,035
good idea and i can't read it

1386
00:47:03,035 --> 00:47:04,865
but you don't understand maybe you can

1387
00:47:04,865 --> 00:47:05,765
make heads or tails out of it

1388
00:47:06,005 --> 00:47:07,985
if if you could sometimes do you

1389
00:47:07,985 --> 00:47:09,455
ever have that fantasy of laika be

1390
00:47:09,455 --> 00:47:10,775
good to go back to college or

1391
00:47:10,775 --> 00:47:12,035
go back to high school yeah i'm

1392
00:47:12,035 --> 00:47:13,265
learn more you know like what if

1393
00:47:13,265 --> 00:47:15,965
they made high school learn or want

1394
00:47:15,965 --> 00:47:16,262
to fuck

1395
00:47:18,455 --> 00:47:19,715
one of them a prize i thought

1396
00:47:19,715 --> 00:47:21,515
it was to not be emotional ie

1397
00:47:21,725 --> 00:47:23,075
terrified all the time yeah i know

1398
00:47:23,075 --> 00:47:24,095
when i think of it now my

1399
00:47:24,105 --> 00:47:26,555
crush i just be having fun and

1400
00:47:26,555 --> 00:47:28,385
like doing well like oh i have

1401
00:47:28,385 --> 00:47:29,585
the opposite where it's like all i

1402
00:47:29,585 --> 00:47:31,895
did was have fun and i didn't

1403
00:47:31,895 --> 00:47:33,755
learn a single thing like no well

00:47:33,755 --> 00:47:34,865
i mean i was having fun and

1405
00:47:34,895 --> 00:47:36,545
i guess my social life but i

1406
00:47:36,785 --> 00:47:37,498
i hated living

1407
00:47:37,535 --> 00:47:38,705
in the door my god so much

1408
00:47:38,735 --> 00:47:40,265
anxiety about like a lot of that

1409
00:47:40,265 --> 00:47:41,975
stuff and so i would enjoy to

1410
00:47:41,975 --> 00:47:44,255
not have that dormitory yeah did i

1411
00:47:44,255 --> 00:47:46,535

1413
00:47:48,665 --> 00:47:50,375
more question yeah sure i was gonna

1414
00:47:50,465 --> 00:47:51,785
oh what we're gonna say i just

1415
00:47:51,785 --> 00:47:53,075
wondered if like they made high school

1416
00:47:53,075 --> 00:47:54,725
for people like us whereas like we

1417
00:47:54,725 --> 00:47:57,425
had to go for people outrage

1418
00:47:57,695 --> 00:47:58,505
you had to go and you had

1419
00:47:58,505 --> 00:47:59,405
to do it for years if you're

1420
00:47:59,495 --> 00:48:01,297
it'd be fun my god no no

1421
00:48:01,297 --> 00:48:03,155
that's your life and your careers waiting

1422
00:48:03,155 --> 00:48:05,015
for you when i didn't like being

1423
00:48:05,015 --> 00:48:07,415
a student yeah i think i'd like

1424
00:48:07,415 --> 00:48:09,035
it okay yes i haven't read it

1425
00:48:09,275 --> 00:48:09,635
yeah

1426
00:48:10,745 --> 00:48:12,275
think of someone who is your friend

1427
00:48:12,665 --> 00:48:14,225
do not select your moron do not

1428
00:48:14,255 --> 00:48:16,925
let your best friend when i think

1429
00:48:17,105 --> 00:48:18,995
about making jokes but make sure the

1430
00:48:18,995 --> 00:48:20,855
person is someone you would classify as

1431
00:48:20,855 --> 00:48:24,875
considerably more than an acquaintance ah okay

1432
00:48:24,935 --> 00:48:26,345
this friend is going to be attacked

1433
00:48:26,345 --> 00:48:28,745
by a grizzly bear okay now this

1434
00:48:28,745 --> 00:48:30,455
person will survive teaching my friend

1435
00:48:31,325 --> 00:48:33,425
this person will survive this bear attack

1436
00:48:33,425 --> 00:48:35,405
that is guaranteed there is a one

1437
00:48:35,405 --> 00:48:36,875
hundred percent chance that your friend will

1438
00:48:36,875 --> 00:48:39,425
live however the extent of his injuries

1439
00:48:39,425 --> 00:48:41,495
is unknown he might receive nothing but

1440
00:48:41,495 --> 00:48:43,475
a few superficial scratches but he might

1441
00:48:43,475 --> 00:48:45,485
also lose a limb or multiple limbs

1442
00:48:45,815 --> 00:48:47,585
he might recover completely in twenty four

1443
00:48:47,585 --> 00:48:49,235
hours with nothing but a great story

1444
00:48:49,265 --> 00:48:50,315
or he might spend the rest of

1445
00:48:50,315 --> 00:48:50,975
his life in a wheel

1446
00:48:50,977 --> 00:48:53,255
chair somehow you have the ability to

1447
00:48:53,255 --> 00:48:55,385
stop this attack from happening you can

1448
00:48:55,385 --> 00:48:57,125
magically save your friend from the bear

1449
00:48:57,305 --> 00:48:58,595
but his salvation will come at a

1450
00:48:58,865 --> 00:49:01,055
peculiar price if you choose to stop

1451
00:49:01,055 --> 00:49:02,525
the bear will always reign for the

1452
00:49:02,525 --> 00:49:03,875
rest of your life wherever you go

1453
00:49:03,875 --> 00:49:05,525
it will be raining sometimes it will

1454
00:49:05,525 --> 00:49:06,905
pour and sometimes it will drizzle but

1455
00:49:06,905 --> 00:49:08,585
it will never not be raining will

1456
00:49:08,585 --> 00:49:10,265
the friend know that we've saved but

1457
00:49:10,265 --> 00:49:11,045
it won't allow him

1458
00:49:11,285 --> 00:49:12,730
but it won't rant oh well then

1459
00:49:12,730 --> 00:49:14,525
frankly i'm saying it might slip but

1460
00:49:14,525 --> 00:49:16,205
it won't rain over the totality of

1461
00:49:16,205 --> 00:49:18,155
the earth nor will the hydraulic whole

1462
00:49:18,155 --> 00:49:21,125
cycle being destroyed disrupted okay these storm

1463
00:49:21,125 --> 00:49:22,445

00:50:18,335 --> 00:50:19,833
nothing you don't know what's gonna happen

1495
00:50:19,835 --> 00:50:21,875

01:01:48,910 --> 01:01:50,200
that is what all you do at

1842
01:01:50,200 --> 01:01:51,550
that point where it's like let's watch

1843
01:01:51,550 --> 01:01:53,110
a movie these will not

1844
01:01:53,230 --> 01:01:55,000
owing to the netflix thing is right

1845
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:56,590
where people know netflix and chill it's

1846
01:01:56,680 --> 01:01:58,630
chill and they're literally put on anything

1847
01:01:58,630 --> 01:01:59,950
but i was just like why did

1848
01:01:59,950 --> 01:02:02,050
we have this half hour thing where

1849
01:02:02,050 --> 01:02:04,510
we were like deciding and rolling oh

1850
01:02:04,510 --> 01:02:05,830
no i've seen this so it's like

1851
01:02:05,860 --> 01:02:08,530
a dance of courtship yeah anyway okay

1852
01:02:08,530 --> 01:02:10,480
wait so you know michael jackson i

1853
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:12,880
saw michael jackson although now that i

1854
01:02:12,910 --> 01:02:13,390
think about

1855
01:02:13,696 --> 01:02:15,520
it could have been anyone because he's

1856
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:17,050
wearing a surgical mask and the mirrored

1857
01:02:17,050 --> 01:02:18,610
sunglasses and a hat has been any

1858
01:02:18,970 --> 01:02:20,830
like the the tendrils of hair creeping

1859
01:02:20,830 --> 01:02:22,840
out and um tendrils

1860
01:02:24,280 --> 01:02:25,780
that's an inside joke between the jewels

1861
01:02:25,990 --> 01:02:26,740
ah cool

1862
01:02:28,510 --> 01:02:30,130
thank you you dilly dilly yeah

1863
01:02:31,240 --> 01:02:33,280
yeah i reckon but he came in

1864
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:35,380
with like three or four security people

1865
01:02:35,710 --> 01:02:38,170
um who established kind of a perimeter

1866
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:40,090
around him as you browse through laser

1867
01:02:40,090 --> 01:02:42,130
discs when you thought you were gonna

1868
01:02:42,130 --> 01:02:43,840
break that never said a word if

1869
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:45,400
you were to break that perimeter you're

1870
01:02:45,460 --> 01:02:47,080
a customer at the store you have

1871
01:02:47,080 --> 01:02:48,580
rights to go wherever you want i

1872
01:02:48,610 --> 01:02:51,010
think i think they were letting people

1873
01:02:51,070 --> 01:02:51,280
in

1874
01:02:51,387 --> 01:02:53,560
around but i think the idea was

1875
01:02:53,860 --> 01:02:56,050
they were being watchful they were they

1876
01:02:56,089 --> 01:02:58,270
were to say submission two hundred day

1877
01:02:58,270 --> 01:02:59,650
would maybe say like if you share

1878
01:02:59,650 --> 01:03:01,240
your tribal leicester then they would say

1879
01:03:01,840 --> 01:03:04,090
and he would say yes hey hey

1880
01:03:04,106 --> 01:03:05,950

1882
01:03:07,510 --> 01:03:08,800

discs

1886
01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:12,940
cool that was that would be a

1887
01:03:12,940 --> 01:03:13,960
thing that you would see a lot

1888
01:03:13,990 --> 01:03:16,630
is like wealthy celebrities would come in

1889
01:03:16,630 --> 01:03:18,850
