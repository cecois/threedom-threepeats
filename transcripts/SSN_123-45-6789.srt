217
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:21,660

just hoard it like why didn't they

223
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:31,500

like spin the wheel and everything to

229
00:07:38,169 --> 00:07:39,210

know when you're when you're a kid

300
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,300
sometimes your parents are a little more

301
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,160
generous with you knowing that like you're

302
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,210
not going to work out so much

303
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:02,280
so it's like you agree beforehand because

304
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:04,620
typical hangman yes it's ah you got

305
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:06,930
the head you got the body to

306
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:07,200
arms

307
00:10:08,009 --> 00:10:11,445
right but a gruesome game but but

308
00:10:11,445 --> 00:10:13,365
the but your parents you can sort

309
00:10:13,365 --> 00:10:14,685
of decide like oh okay we're gonna

310
00:10:14,715 --> 00:10:16,785
you're gonna get to have feet yeah

311
00:10:16,995 --> 00:10:17,985
you know or you're gonna get to

312
00:10:17,985 --> 00:10:19,965
have any more chances you if you're

313
00:10:19,965 --> 00:10:22,995
really like dive fingers on youtube five

314
00:10:22,995 --> 00:10:24,225
years any chance you've gotten all the

315
00:10:24,225 --> 00:10:25,425
letters of the alphabet by that point

316
00:10:25,425 --> 00:10:28,035
it's like you know wow media wow

317
00:10:28,095 --> 00:10:30,585
nah four five six plus and then

318
00:10:30,585 --> 00:10:32,775
plus ten that's sixteen if you buy

319
00:10:32,775 --> 00:10:36,885
sixteen then toes twenty six twenty six

320
00:10:37,005 --> 00:10:38,535
so what if he did all fares

321
00:10:38,535 --> 00:10:40,275
on the head if you had a

322
00:10:40,285 --> 00:10:42,285
numbers and you were doing close though

323
00:10:42,405 --> 00:10:44,385
i think like a t-shirt and pants

324
00:10:44,385 --> 00:10:46,365
at some what was on the t-shirt

325
00:10:47,025 --> 00:10:47,805
smelly things do

326
00:10:50,265 --> 00:10:51,525
and then you would complete that slowly

327
00:10:51,525 --> 00:10:53,295
right exactly i know those are calling

328
00:10:53,445 --> 00:10:55,695
smiley faces and within within reason why

329
00:10:55,755 --> 00:10:57,555

00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:21,255
there and what i did not take

399
00:13:21,255 --> 00:13:23,115
into account was that

400
00:13:23,265 --> 00:13:25,065
um there were a couple of big

401
00:13:25,065 --> 00:13:27,257
hills on the well where like up

402
00:13:27,316 --> 00:13:29,115
the sidewalk went down like when i

403
00:13:29,205 --> 00:13:31,365
when i was first going it was

404
00:13:31,365 --> 00:13:33,855
so steep that i had to like

405
00:13:33,915 --> 00:13:35,505
put your ass to hang onto yeah

406
00:13:37,575 --> 00:13:39,135
i had to like hang onto to

407
00:13:39,135 --> 00:13:41,535
like parked cars and stuff because i

408
00:13:41,535 --> 00:13:42,705
could not there was no way that

409
00:13:42,735 --> 00:13:45,105
elementum would have killed me right what's

410
00:13:45,105 --> 00:13:46,755
worse going down or going up going

411
00:13:46,755 --> 00:13:48,105
up as worse i had to like

412
00:13:48,165 --> 00:13:49,681
it was like doing now i was

413
00:13:50,415 --> 00:13:52,785
always myself up by like parking meters

414
00:13:52,815 --> 00:13:55,335
oh why does use take this scott

415
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:56,835
that's a great show

416
00:13:57,406 --> 00:14:00,135
yeah never occurred to me wow never

417
00:14:00,135 --> 00:14:02,115
occurred yeah there on times the stuff

418
00:14:02,115 --> 00:14:04,365
with their own your families is wild

419
00:14:04,425 --> 00:14:06,795
when you later realize oh simple resolution

420
00:14:07,245 --> 00:14:09,703
yeah exactly like you could have killed

421
00:14:09,703 --> 00:14:11,355
yourself instead of just taking off your

422
00:14:11,355 --> 00:14:14,115
skates and that's a great lesson look

423
00:14:14,115 --> 00:14:16,335
my parents paid for those skates and

424
00:14:16,395 --> 00:14:16,995
they gave

425
00:14:16,995 --> 00:14:18,195
them to me and i was not

426
00:14:18,195 --> 00:14:20,085
going to disrespect them by taking them

427
00:14:20,085 --> 00:14:21,855
off and walking in my stocking feet

428
00:14:21,855 --> 00:14:24,255
so they gave you this gates yeah

429
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:25,455
he bought them and then gave them

430
00:14:25,455 --> 00:14:27,285
to you i think so you owe

431
00:14:27,285 --> 00:14:28,365

432
00:14:28,365 --> 00:14:30,225

481
00:15:58,275 --> 00:15:59,715
the journey and i was like that's

00:17:23,355 --> 00:17:24,503
the case that people can get with

534
00:17:24,555 --> 00:17:24,615

536
00:17:26,985 --> 00:17:29,085
don't understand why every brand is down

537
00:17:29,085 --> 00:17:30,405
at the same time as it was

538
00:17:30,435 --> 00:17:32,415
just the toilet paper shortage the way

539
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:34,425
it was explained to me was ah

540
00:17:34,455 --> 00:17:36,285
there are two types of toilet paper

541
00:17:36,885 --> 00:17:38,745
um there's stuff people use at home

542
00:17:38,775 --> 00:17:40,215
and then there's stuff people use in

543
00:17:40,245 --> 00:17:42,405
offices yes the worst the industrial yeah

544
00:17:42,435 --> 00:17:44,805
right and um everyone

545
00:17:44,865 --> 00:17:47,505
left the offices and so no one's

546
00:17:47,505 --> 00:17:49,455
using all the toilet paper in offices

547
00:17:49,665 --> 00:17:50,985
oh they're all using it at home

548
00:17:50,985 --> 00:17:53,085
and the supplies shocked they can't get

549
00:17:53,085 --> 00:17:54,375
in there and the supply chain is

550
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:56,175
like building up outside of the stores

551
00:17:56,175 --> 00:17:58,425
and the builders now double the demand

552
00:17:58,425 --> 00:17:59,595
fuel which is going into shitting in

553
00:17:59,595 --> 00:18:01,785
front of the office yeah but there's

554
00:18:01,785 --> 00:18:03,255
more to the whole office can agree

555

up so the person doesn't know that

603
00:19:27,855 --> 00:19:29,355
it's happening yeah that would be a

604
00:19:29,355 --> 00:19:31,395
few basic like if if you and

605
00:19:31,395 --> 00:19:33,435

a full movie that's not very many

646
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:52,670

them with the numbers that it is

876
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:22,910
a scam

877
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:25,674
are they this or apple giftcard yeah

878
00:28:25,674 --> 00:28:26,930
or anything like that yeah it's like

879
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:30,980
it's basically ah those are untraceable like

880
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:32,390
once you take once you take a

881
00:28:32,390 --> 00:28:35,030
picture of these numbers they just use

882
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:37,010
them as cash and it's untraceable and

883
00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:38,270
that's why they asked for them all

884
00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:40,610
the time like god looks so bad

885
00:28:40,610 --> 00:28:42,050
with that story that was so awful

886
00:28:42,050 --> 00:28:43,070
and stress

887
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:44,150
useful because then you have to like

888
00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:45,740
try to like fix it all and

889
00:28:45,770 --> 00:28:47,810
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah but look

890
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,220
if it sounds too weird to be

891
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:51,620
true it is yeah and i think

892
00:28:51,650 --> 00:28:53,480
that it's really shady though to reference

893
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:55,310
another family member because that makes you

894
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:57,530
think oh this is oh zazu yeah

895
00:28:57,530 --> 00:29:01,130
exactly but also after after she was

896
00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:02,510
taken in by them they took over

897
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:03,230
her facebook

898
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:04,430
account because she gave all of her

899
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:05,870
passwords to them and all that and

900
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:07,820
so they start going out to everyone

901
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:10,250
she knew including some of my family

902
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:13,790

1227
00:40:44,635 --> 00:40:46,375

1230
00:40:51,265 --> 00:40:54,085
outtakes have each playwright on six different

1231
00:40:54,085 --> 00:40:56,605
completely unrelated words one player chooses their

1232
00:40:56,605 --> 00:40:59,635
occupation fight of course it's different words

1233
00:41:01,135 --> 00:41:02,515
if they're unrelated you wouldn't be ready

1234
00:41:02,515 --> 00:41:03,985
to have the same word six times

1235
00:41:04,555 --> 00:41:05,965
right but it's like we have a

1236
00:41:05,965 --> 00:41:08,365
lot of notes have each playwright on

1237
00:41:08,365 --> 00:41:11,305
six completely unrelated words one player chooses

1238
00:41:11,305 --> 00:41:12,925

players each player chooses two to three

1240
00:41:15,355 --> 00:41:16,945
of the words my only question is

00:41:16,945 --> 00:41:20,215
how do we do our occupation like

1242
00:41:20,245 --> 00:41:20,935
each player says

1243
00:41:20,935 --> 00:41:22,315
is their occupation what does that mean

1244
00:41:23,245 --> 00:41:24,316
i'm going to read more and see

1245
00:41:24,475 --> 00:41:25,855
if that okay brings it to light

1246
00:41:25,945 --> 00:41:29,274
alright one player choose have each play

completely related words one player chooses their

1252
00:41:39,955 --> 00:41:42,145
occupation and announces it to the players

00:41:42,355 --> 00:41:43,885
each player chooses two to three of

1254
00:41:43,885 --> 00:41:45,715
the words to combine as the name

1255
00:41:45,715 --> 00:41:48,115
of a new invention like tent juice

1256
00:41:48,145 --> 00:41:50,845
or dreamcloud which they will then attempt

1257
00:41:50,845 --> 00:41:53,185
to sell to you with an enticing

1258
00:41:53,185 --> 00:41:55,615
sales pitch their pitch should explain what

1259
00:41:55,615 --> 00:41:55,735
their

1260
00:41:55,765 --> 00:41:57,895
invention is how it works and why

1261
00:41:57,895 --> 00:42:00,025
you would particularly want it given your

1262
00:42:00,055 --> 00:42:01,795
occupation so we can just come up

1263
00:42:01,795 --> 00:42:03,205
with an occupation it does it's not

1264
00:42:03,235 --> 00:42:04,825
our actual occupation because we would all

1265
00:42:04,825 --> 00:42:07,225
be professional podcasters have each player write

1266
00:42:07,225 --> 00:42:10,195
down six different completely unrelated words one

1267
00:42:10,195 --> 00:42:12,385
player chooses their occupation and announces it

1268
00:42:12,385 --> 00:42:14,275
to the players each player chooses two

1269
00:42:14,275 --> 00:42:15,535
to three of the words to combine

1270
00:42:15,535 --> 00:42:15,895
as the name

1271
00:42:15,895 --> 00:42:17,317
mm of a new invention like ten

1272
00:42:17,317 --> 00:42:19,435
tensions or dreamcloud which way they will

1273
00:42:19,435 --> 00:42:20,815
then attempt to sell to you with

1274
00:42:20,815 --> 00:42:22,675
an enticing sales pitch their pitch should

1275
00:42:22,675 --> 00:42:24,535
explain what their invention is how it

1276
00:42:24,535 --> 00:42:26,535
works and why you would particularly want

1277
00:42:26,575 --> 00:42:29,155
given your occupation inventions still need to

1278
00:42:29,155 --> 00:42:30,955
be logical or work in a realistic

1279
00:42:30,955 --> 00:42:33,295
way once everyone has had the chance

1280
00:42:33,295 --> 00:42:34,945
to pitch to you choose your favorite

1281
00:42:34,945 --> 00:42:36,055

1282
00:42:36,085 --> 00:42:38,125

1283
00:42:38,125 --> 00:42:39,745

1463
00:48:42,775 --> 00:48:45,115
good for hair okay what it is

1464
00:48:45,115 --> 00:48:46,615
is it captures

1465
00:48:46,615 --> 00:48:47,845
as it has a goo in it

1466
00:48:48,055 --> 00:48:51,325
that soaks up the moon's rays and

1467
00:48:51,325 --> 00:48:53,305
then what you do is you open

1468
00:48:53,305 --> 00:48:54,775
the window just a crack mind you

1469
00:48:54,805 --> 00:48:57,055
just a crack and then you let

1470
00:48:57,055 --> 00:49:00,355
that ah that moon glue seep into

1471
00:49:00,355 --> 00:49:01,885
the classroom the gases from it it

1472
00:49:01,885 --> 00:49:03,835
off gases into the classroom and it

1473
00:49:03,835 --> 00:49:06,775
keeps the kids alert and awake i

1474
00:49:06,775 --> 00:49:08,635
i love that so they're always ready

1475
00:49:08,635 --> 00:49:10,224
to learn it's it's a gas so

1476
00:49:10,224 --> 00:49:12,715
it's not connect to a demon himself

1477
00:49:12,775 --> 00:49:14,215
no it's called a demon because it

1478
00:49:14,215 --> 00:49:16,495
seems almost like magical and evil because

1479
00:49:16,585 --> 00:49:18,505
it's so this sort of smoker gas

1480
00:49:18,505 --> 00:49:19,495
comes through the air and makes all

1481
00:49:19,495 --> 00:49:21,445
the kids stay away it's invisible but

1482
00:49:21,445 --> 00:49:22,735
it gets into their nostrils and their

1483
00:49:22,735 --> 00:49:24,385
little lungs and it keeps them alert

1484
00:49:24,415 --> 00:49:25,555
and perky and now does it get

1485
00:49:25,555 --> 00:49:26,905
into my nostrils no

1486
00:49:26,965 --> 00:49:28,765
it doesn't work on adults and so

1487
00:49:28,765 --> 00:49:30,205
i won't be getting into toxicity but

1488
00:49:30,205 --> 00:49:31,705
the kids will yes they will but

1489
00:49:31,735 --> 00:49:34,345
it's harmful if breathed in but you

1490
00:49:34,345 --> 00:49:35,755
mustn't touch it if you're a child

1491
00:49:35,815 --> 00:49:37,585
but it's going into it's harmful if

1492
00:49:37,585 --> 00:49:39,295
breathed in but you mustn't to know

1493
00:49:39,325 --> 00:49:41,095
it's not harmful of breathed in it's

1494
00:49:41,095 --> 00:49:42,865
