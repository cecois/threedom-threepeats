00:11:47,195 --> 00:11:48,245
next day and shoot to show and

336
00:11:48,245 --> 00:11:50,675
like i was like crying because my

337
00:11:50,675 --> 00:11:52,265
back hurt so much because it felt

338
00:11:52,265 --> 00:11:53,585
like someone was holding a hot pan

339
00:11:53,585 --> 00:11:53,915
against me

340
00:11:53,915 --> 00:11:54,845
the back like it was just like

341
00:11:55,145 --> 00:11:57,485
but but third they weren't no one

342
00:11:57,485 --> 00:11:59,105
was there why would someone hold a

343
00:11:59,105 --> 00:12:01,085
hot pan against your back by punishment

344
00:12:01,475 --> 00:12:02,885
anyway this producer told us what was

345
00:12:02,885 --> 00:12:04,535
happening and then he sent me to

346
00:12:04,565 --> 00:12:06,575
the nurse of the warner brothers lot

347
00:12:06,575 --> 00:12:08,975
and they diagnosed me with shingles and

348
00:12:08,975 --> 00:12:09,995
then i had to go get all

349
00:12:09,995 --> 00:12:11,795
these prescriptions and then i still had

350
00:12:11,795 --> 00:12:12,845
to fly to new york and do

351
00:12:12,845 --> 00:12:14,075

360
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:31,145
honestly when i talk about it i

361
00:12:31,145 --> 00:12:33,185

551
00:19:16,955 --> 00:19:18,935

be free here's where we come i'm

844
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:35,000

a baseball game it should be free

846
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,700

1120
00:39:44,105 --> 00:39:46,925
me so there so the voice-overs saying

no there's never gonna be a statue

1122
00:39:48,575 --> 00:39:49,522
of her she's never going to be

1123
00:39:49,522 --> 00:39:51,485
in the hall of fame you know

1124
00:39:51,635 --> 00:39:54,455
um so basically it's this it's it's

1125
00:39:54,455 --> 00:39:56,945
a commercial for sheraton i think where

1126
00:39:56,945 --> 00:39:58,775
this woman works at this hotel is

1127
00:39:58,775 --> 00:40:02,855
running to get this baseball glove to

1128
00:40:02,855 --> 00:40:05,495
this little kid who forgot the glove

1129
00:40:05,495 --> 00:40:07,535
in the room or whatever oh yeah

1130
00:40:07,685 --> 00:40:09,635
like socials where that kid falls in

1131
00:40:09,635 --> 00:40:10,805
the pool on the person link or

1132
00:40:10,805 --> 00:40:11,765
they dropped their stuffed animal

1133
00:40:11,825 --> 00:40:14,525
the big calls up the emergency child

1134
00:40:14,525 --> 00:40:16,955
was drowned but she's a hero she's

1135
00:40:16,955 --> 00:40:18,125
young she's not in the hall of

1136
00:40:18,125 --> 00:40:19,985
fame but she's the unsung hero of

1137
00:40:20,465 --> 00:40:22,835
getting glove about mary ah yeah but

1138
00:40:22,835 --> 00:40:26,555
it's it's what's so weird is the

1139
00:40:26,585 --> 00:40:28,235
the the tone of the commercial like

1140
00:40:28,475 --> 00:40:30,965
it is basically isn't it so funny

1141
00:40:30,995 --> 00:40:31,895
we're treating this

1142
00:40:32,655 --> 00:40:34,545
ah you're like a sports hero yeah

1143
00:40:34,545 --> 00:40:36,555
yeah like the other ones like hopefully

1144
00:40:36,795 --> 00:40:38,325
you know little girls can grow up

1145
00:40:38,325 --> 00:40:40,035
to be sports heroes if they ever

1146
00:40:40,035 --> 00:40:41,879
yeah like there's nothing yeah like yeah

1147
00:40:41,879 --> 00:40:43,065
yeah girls are allowed to play sports

1148
00:40:43,065 --> 00:40:44,744
yeah exactly they're the other one is

1149
00:40:44,744 --> 00:40:47,625
is like facetiously yeah oh in this

1150
00:40:47,625 --> 00:40:50,145
crazy universe like women are treated like

1151
00:40:50,145 --> 00:40:52,575
sports hero she's sliding like as if

1152
00:40:52,575 --> 00:40:52,755
like

1153
00:40:52,785 --> 00:40:54,075
that's a thing that men do in

1154
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:56,535
baseball yeah but but it actually contains

1155
00:40:56,535 --> 00:41:00,045
the phrase she was just a woman

1156
00:41:01,695 --> 00:41:04,035
who cared enough to whatever but does

1157
00:41:04,035 --> 00:41:06,285
that long pause it has just a

1158
00:41:06,285 --> 00:41:08,535
woman hangs there for such a long

1159
00:41:08,565 --> 00:41:11,115
time but it's so weird like as

1160
00:41:11,115 --> 00:41:13,935
you're watching sports and there's this idea

1161
00:41:13,935 --> 00:41:15,345
that it's like well she's never going

1162
00:41:15,345 --> 00:41:16,635
to be no one's ever gonna give

1163
00:41:16,635 --> 00:41:19,245
a shit about her later i don't

1164
00:41:19,245 --> 00:41:20,805
like it like she's a hero but

1165
00:41:20,835 --> 00:41:21,345
you know not like

1166
00:41:21,405 --> 00:41:23,835
really it is weird that all of

1167
00:41:23,835 --> 00:41:25,935
those sports are only men well you

1168
00:41:25,935 --> 00:41:27,825
know or why went with not even

1169
00:41:27,825 --> 00:41:29,265
one i went with ria to a

1170
00:41:29,265 --> 00:41:31,695
game a year ago or so and

1171
00:41:31,695 --> 00:41:33,105
there was a cheated on me there

00:41:35,085 --> 00:41:38,715
and we fall know ah she there

00:41:42,105 --> 00:41:44,775
don't really older than that yeah no

1176
00:41:44,775 --> 00:41:46,005
she was twelve or thirteen this was

1177
00:41:46,005 --> 00:41:48,195
last year yeah person i think game

1178
00:41:48,255 --> 00:41:49,635
you know there was ah there was

1179
00:41:49,635 --> 00:41:52,395
one of those um in traditionally i'd

1180
00:41:52,395 --> 00:41:53,985
always seen them as like you know

1181
00:41:53,985 --> 00:41:54,465
teenage boy

1182
00:41:54,465 --> 00:41:56,325
boys one of those people who during

1183
00:41:56,325 --> 00:41:57,825
when they're warming up and throwing around

1184
00:41:57,825 --> 00:41:58,845
the field what is it what's the

1185
00:41:58,845 --> 00:42:02,265
trouble girl yeah yeah yeah yeah and

1186
00:42:02,265 --> 00:42:04,725
she was throwing and she you know

1187
00:42:04,725 --> 00:42:05,835
she's supposed to go get the balls

1188
00:42:05,906 --> 00:42:07,695
thrown but she was throwing so fucking

1189
00:42:07,695 --> 00:42:10,245
far yeah like so much further than

1190
00:42:10,845 --> 00:42:12,945
like almost as far as the professionals

1191
00:42:12,945 --> 00:42:14,625
in the game yeah i was like

1192
00:42:14,985 --> 00:42:17,085
well she should just be playing shouldn't

1193
00:42:17,085 --> 00:42:18,855
yeah i mean like shit lay you

1194
00:42:18,855 --> 00:42:19,784
know i mean in a couple of

1195
00:42:19,784 --> 00:42:22,005
years like shouldn't she just why is

1196
00:42:22,005 --> 00:42:23,925
there not been one woman baseball player

1197
00:42:23,955 --> 00:42:26,385
really weird it's like baseball isn't a

1198
00:42:26,505 --> 00:42:29,655
strength spore i mean maybe the batting

1199
00:42:29,655 --> 00:42:31,635
part of course you have to be

1200
00:42:31,695 --> 00:42:33,885
strong that's why all responsible juice up

1201
00:42:33,885 --> 00:42:34,785
so much on pa

1202
00:42:34,785 --> 00:42:35,805
possible for a woman to be able

1203
00:42:35,805 --> 00:42:37,395
to hit a home run yeah so

1204
00:42:37,395 --> 00:42:39,195
like at least ah you know graphical

1205
00:42:39,195 --> 00:42:42,615
demo well extremely athletic person it just

1206
00:42:42,615 --> 00:42:45,435
seems weird that besides that there's baseball

1207
00:42:45,435 --> 00:42:48,225
players who do you know who compartmentalize

1208
00:42:48,375 --> 00:42:50,295
who do these one things like i

1209
00:42:50,325 --> 00:42:53,025
only i'm a i'm a desert runner

1210
00:42:53,025 --> 00:42:54,915
yeah zach you know i do this

1211
00:42:54,975 --> 00:42:56,595
one fucking thing yeah you know yeah

1212
00:42:56,625 --> 00:42:58,485
like with basketball it makes more sense

1213
00:42:58,485 --> 00:42:59,685
in the sense that like some people

1214
00:42:59,685 --> 00:43:00,735
are like ben going to be like

1215
00:43:00,855 --> 00:43:02,595
men are like seven feet tall and

1216
00:43:02,595 --> 00:43:03,915
it's like that's a whole ride and

1217
00:43:03,915 --> 00:43:05,865
with acting like best actor and best

1218
00:43:05,865 --> 00:43:08,355
actress definitely men are better and stuff

1219
00:43:08,595 --> 00:43:11,175
and better at being like faking a

1220
00:43:11,325 --> 00:43:12,795
characters and stuff

1221
00:43:14,895 --> 00:43:16,695
well there are there are of course

1222
00:43:16,695 --> 00:43:18,915
women baseball players and there's a yes

1223
00:43:18,945 --> 00:43:20,925
there's a national there's a national team

1224
00:43:20,925 --> 00:43:22,995
there's a there's a there's two but

1225
00:43:22,995 --> 00:43:24,345
where's there's just women there's a team

1226
00:43:24,375 --> 00:43:25,785
yes there's a men's team and women's

1227
00:43:25,785 --> 00:43:29,685
team us national team um and but

1228
00:43:29,955 --> 00:43:31,125
when i i went to a phillies

1229
00:43:31,125 --> 00:43:32,685
game to see the phillies play the

1230
00:43:32,685 --> 00:43:33,645
dodgers recently

1231
00:43:34,095 --> 00:43:36,735
and janie came with me for this

1232
00:43:36,735 --> 00:43:37,335
finally

1233
00:43:40,005 --> 00:43:42,195
my week were we were watching the

1234
00:43:42,225 --> 00:43:43,845
game and in between she said oh

1235
00:43:43,845 --> 00:43:46,095
look the ball girl is throwing two

1236
00:43:46,695 --> 00:43:49,845
are they arise viewers no nother it's

1237
00:43:50,145 --> 00:43:52,185
way more common that's great it's way

1238
00:43:52,185 --> 00:43:53,865
more common like hey yeah i just

1239
00:43:53,865 --> 00:43:55,725
wondered if traditionally throughout the years they

1240
00:43:55,725 --> 00:43:57,165
were ball girls and i was just

1241
00:43:57,165 --> 00:43:58,545
not aware of it know why

1242
00:43:58,545 --> 00:43:59,445
i don't know when it changed i'm

1243
00:43:59,445 --> 00:44:02,115
sure for the majority of baseball they

1244
00:44:02,115 --> 00:44:04,215
were boys but i thought any is

1245
00:44:04,215 --> 00:44:06,555
bore but thinking but here's the thing

1246
00:44:06,885 --> 00:44:08,295
so she said oh look at that

1247
00:44:08,295 --> 00:44:09,855
and and so is either it was

1248
00:44:10,185 --> 00:44:12,405
i think it was nick williams the

1249
00:44:12,405 --> 00:44:15,405
phillies right fielder between as they you

1250
00:44:15,405 --> 00:44:17,145
know as the innings were changing over

1251
00:44:17,145 --> 00:44:18,345
when the when the phillies would take

1252
00:44:18,345 --> 00:44:18,705
the field

1253
00:44:18,705 --> 00:44:20,745
old they were throwing the ball back

1254
00:44:20,745 --> 00:44:23,115
and forth so she's by you know

1255
00:44:23,115 --> 00:44:24,735
like first base and she's throwing the

1256
00:44:24,735 --> 00:44:26,325
ball back to him and i never

1257
00:44:26,355 --> 00:44:30,585
either who's on first either either this

1258
00:44:30,585 --> 00:44:33,315
was something that did not happen often

1259
00:44:33,315 --> 00:44:35,265
or something i never noticed before and

1260
00:44:35,265 --> 00:44:36,345
i forgot to look the last time

1261
00:44:36,345 --> 00:44:37,665
i went to a game steve have

1262
00:44:37,665 --> 00:44:38,835
but they did it

1263
00:44:39,135 --> 00:44:41,355
every time every time the phillies took

1264
00:44:41,355 --> 00:44:43,125
the field they would throw the ball

1265
00:44:43,155 --> 00:44:45,075
until it was time for the the

1266
00:44:45,165 --> 00:44:46,995
the inning to start and it made

1267
00:44:46,995 --> 00:44:49,155
me so happy to see oh yeah

1268
00:44:49,215 --> 00:44:51,010
me so happy to know i love

1269
00:44:51,135 --> 00:44:53,355
it and i i i just wondered

1270
00:44:53,355 --> 00:44:54,615
when i saw it i was like

1271
00:44:55,035 --> 00:44:56,565
well that's great she's got this love

1272
00:44:56,565 --> 00:44:58,125
of the game what are they raising

1273
00:44:58,125 --> 00:44:59,025
her to be though just

1274
00:44:59,055 --> 00:44:59,805
a fan

1275
00:45:00,945 --> 00:45:02,925
flailing like that yeah it's weird about

1276
00:45:02,925 --> 00:45:04,905
it like that there's no there is

1277
00:45:04,905 --> 00:45:07,455
no ability for a woman to be

1278
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:09,225

on purpose did you watch the tony

1375
00:48:47,625 --> 00:48:49,005

1376
00:48:49,035 --> 00:48:50,385

1377
00:48:50,385 --> 00:48:52,575
have thoughts did you watch videos that

1378
00:48:52,575 --> 00:48:53,835

but don't you want to hear what

1386
00:49:10,275 --> 00:49:12,135

early on what type of songs to

1390
00:49:20,055 --> 00:49:21,345

shanxi it's easy for shake rooney

1618
00:58:29,685 --> 00:58:31,845
the first player describes the minister's cat

1619
00:58:31,875 --> 00:58:34,035
with an adjective beginning with the letter

1620
00:58:34,065 --> 00:58:37,065
a for example a minister's cat is

1621
00:58:37,065 --> 00:58:38,145
an adorable cat

1622
00:58:39,255 --> 00:58:42,315
each player then does the same using

1623
00:58:42,315 --> 00:58:44,625
different adjectives starting with the same letter

1624
00:58:44,865 --> 00:58:46,365
once everyone has done so the first

1625
00:58:46,365 --> 00:58:48,135

1626
00:58:48,135 --> 00:58:50,625
