36
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:31,770
the same time

37
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:35,160

38
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,440
don't think that i have you don't

39
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:39,870

00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:41,849
one place at one time but i

41
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,290
would even have but then that's not

42
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:45,360
really you're not being two places your

43
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,680
clone is being one point know but

44
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,090
but like what if what if you

45
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,470
could be two places at the same

46
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:52,110
time and your consciousness you could see

47
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:53,040
both places at the same

48
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,330
in time like in a split screen

49
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:58,260
like dr manhattan and you're operating on

50
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:00,780
a higher level of being and you

51
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:03,720
are existing within two locations having equally

52
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,000
good time in both i guess i

53
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,410
would like to be a higher level

54
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:09,180
of being if i'm having a good

55
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:11,610
time yes well you're having a bad

56
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:13,200
time in both well it's possible

57
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:13,980
that you get in a fight in

58
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:14,910
one of them but you're having a

59
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:16,740
good time with the other oh yeah

60
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:18,030
what if i what if i like

61
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:19,170
getting the fight because i'm a messy

62
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:20,970
bitch who loves drama oh my god

63
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:22,530
do you do you don't tell me

64
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:23,610
what it was but have you had

65
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:25,560
a fight recently like in your life

66
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:28,470
like a fist fight know like a

67
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:30,450
fight like not like not like an

68
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:32,820
argument with janie but like just someone

69
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:33,360
hoping

70
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:36,660
oh well because that's different that's not

71
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:37,590
really what i mean like i mean

72
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:39,090
like jane is the only version ball

73
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:40,560
seen in a year but like with

74
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,840
a fray i know a parking lot

75
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,330
or something no it's been i think

76
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:46,410
it's been quite a while since i've

77
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:48,360
had any kind of like you know

78
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:52,140
verbal argument with somebody yeah yeah maybe

79
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:53,520
it's a message that's a silver

80
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,590
or lighting to the pandemic fewer arguments

81
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,890
i think the thing that's true i

82
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:01,500
think the pandemic there was a period

83
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,390
of adjustment at the beginning where it

84
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:05,520
was like oh no we need to

85
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:08,550
figure our lives out while we're doing

86
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:10,530
this and the way we were living

87
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:13,020
our lives is not the way we

88
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:13,680
have to live our

89
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:15,060
lives now so it led to a

90
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,770
couple of arguments where it was like

91
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:20,130
just like about day-to-day stuff like you

92
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:21,270
know like people being like you're not

93
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:22,890
following the rules or that kind of

94
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:24,300
thing or just like what are the

95
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,920
rules anymore like we need to figure

96
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,090
that out like oh if we're the

97
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:28,770
only people we're gonna see what are

98
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:30,300
the rules like what are we doing

99
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:31,980
here so it led to a lead

100
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:33,630
to a couple of arguments oh you

101
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:33,840
men

102
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,580
do you mean in in your household

103
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:36,844
you don't mean like the world is

104
00:03:36,844 --> 00:03:39,090
the society um yeah we had we

105
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:40,740
definitely had some tense moments where it

106
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:42,840
was like but but i will give

107
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,120
us credit that we recognized it instantly

108
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,130
for what it was yeah which is

109
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:48,870
like we're not supposed to be seeing

110
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,910
because you're just mush you i just

111
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:52,140
said it last night to mike i

112
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:53,550
was like normally

113
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:56,190
we are a part like three months

114
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:58,170
probably total a year like we're we're

115
00:03:58,170 --> 00:03:59,880
traveling and doing other things not sure

116
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:01,620
yeah just from all the time i

117
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:03,630
spent three months are shitting you know

118
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,960
just crazy huh i'm outside he take

119
00:04:07,003 --> 00:04:08,340
shitting it a year adds up to

120
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:10,260
three months three months of years

121
00:04:12,478 --> 00:04:14,760
and then for urine and then six

122
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:17,310
months per year of sleeping yeah you

123
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:19,620
only really get three months is that

124
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:21,990
when i sleep six months of sleeping

125
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:24,390
no no you know it's probably it's

126
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:26,670
for it's four months of sleeping probably

127
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:27,900
but what did they say you spend

128
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,820
a third of your life was your

129
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:30,690
dad's

130
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,120
it's a third of your day so

131
00:04:33,403 --> 00:04:34,680
today's your day is made up of

132
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:36,000
your life is made up of days

133
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,190
four months of sleeping three months of

134
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:39,900
shitting that gives you five months of

135
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:43,200
like awake non shitting yeah go time

136
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:47,580
then that's pissing that's true then why

137
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:48,840
do you have left you spend her

138
00:04:48,846 --> 00:04:50,670
jobs eight months a year pissing

139
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,510
some of that overlaps with the shitting

140
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:59,760
and the sleeping oh yeah that's unfortunate

141
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:02,850
oh boy

142
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:05,880
right off the jump right off the

143
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:09,390
jump drive we aren't watching ah lauren

144
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:11,850
would you clone yourself no i mean

145
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:13,230
i don't know it seems like clones

146
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:15,690
are always dumb or annoying and i'm

147
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:19,260
already both in what it is like

148
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,500
again fiction it feels like they're always

149
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,520
like the clones

150
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,440
i was doing something either evil or

151
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:27,600
annoying and you're like oh well he's

152
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,740
gonna make some where there and do

153
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:29,640
this thing and it's gonna look like

154
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,350
i'm saying that well she say the

155
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:34,350
clone doesn't have your memories or anything

156
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:35,850
like that it's like true a true

157
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,560
clone like you know how their classroom

158
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,300
and stuff like that is true comments

159
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:42,330
of course hey there's the title um

160
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:43,650
but you know it's like

161
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,690
where suddenly like there's a clone of

162
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:48,690
view but it's a baby right wow

163
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,880
and it's gonna grow up and have

164
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,980
it's own memories and life and all

165
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:55,620
that nbc and it's own babies it's

166
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:56,790
own club babies but it is a

167
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:58,860
clone of view it's not like a

168
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:01,200
purely like it's not a child that

169
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,670
you have born if you know that's

170
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:03,300
weird

171
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:04,830
like baby i don't think i would

172
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:06,600
want that because then it's like you

173
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,800
would you would have such a hard

174
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,750
time not laying your own shit onto

175
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,910
that baby because it's like like hey

176
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:14,280
don't get loose because actually like me

177
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,590
and i'd be like oh no now

178
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:18,300
you're gonna be making all the same

179
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:21,330
mistakes and it'll be hard to watch

180
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:24,000
i'd be like hey here's what

181
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:25,710
happened to me in my life like

182
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:28,050
physically here are your challenges to try

183
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:29,910
to stay away from this because you're

184
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:32,490
like because of all your shame want

185
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:33,990
to beat you up you have the

186
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:36,570
same genetics as me here's what you're

187
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:38,730
gonna go through don't take off your

188
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:40,260

00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:10,920
what am i the old me or

237
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,360

to slapped what

240
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,860
okay so i'm assuming the situation is

241
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:21,960
the young version of me knows who

242
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:22,560
i am

243
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,710
i'm not some old man well yeah

244
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:29,160
hard to not put it together right

245
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:31,800
yeah well yeah you know what for

246
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,570
me i yeah did you look like

247
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:35,220
you looked as a kid like i

248
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:36,450
don't feel like i mean i think

249
00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:38,130
in elementary school i started to look

250
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:40,170
like me but like up until before

251
00:08:40,170 --> 00:08:41,460
that i don't think people would say

252
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:42,330
that was me if they saw a

253
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:43,910
picture of me i don't know if

254
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:46,770
if you look like you if twenty

255
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:48,420
one year old me saw me now

256
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:50,190
i don't think he would be like

257
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,480
is that me

258
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:56,490
yeah it's kinda my point i guess

259
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:57,388
like it's like i still just think

260
00:08:57,388 --> 00:08:59,070
that was some lady but i may

261
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,270

262
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:01,800
at somebody who people tell you you

263
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,720
look like and say if they hadn't

264
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,400

00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,320

266
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,240

00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:13,680
hi i'm like what happens in real

269
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,000
life that's the best

270
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:20,370
yeah oh um but no no the

271
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:22,320
kid knows who you are you're you're

272
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:24,090
let's even say you're the kid's dad

273
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:26,100
like you've taken him on as a

274
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:29,370
parent and you're sneezing at him and

275
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:29,790
your

276
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,310
show him what he's in store for

277
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:34,680
yeah but so but but did you

278
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:37,380
listen everything your dad said no so

279
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:39,210
this kid wouldn't let anything this kid

280
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:40,770
wouldn't listen to you either would you

281
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:42,270
just tell him once like oh hey

282
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:44,880
by the way smoking stupid but scott

283
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:47,910
it's entirely different

284
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:50,940
to have your dad say something give

285
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:53,370
you advice or whatever then your dad

286
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:57,120
and your future your future self to

287
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,580
say look i've been there here's what

288
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:01,800
you shouldn't do that's so different because

289
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,420
they're going like but you're further all

290
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:05,550
the things happening to your body when

291
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:06,870
you start doing this and all the

292
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:08,310
things haven't your brain and i'm all

293
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:09,120
the time to try to quit

294
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,280
and bubble blah and then you might

295
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,410
go look i i think if my

296
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:15,270
future self told me that to do

297
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:17,820
something i might listen yeah right but

298
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,140
you're saying it's not time travel you're

299
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:20,520
saying it's just a clone that it's

300
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:22,290
being ruined that i'm a bass the

301
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:24,570
same dna as you so like technically

302
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:26,880
nothing happened to you that you know

303
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,610
of from smoking other than just

304
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:32,280
you know you have no effects right

305
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:34,350
so you can't even say no but

306
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:36,690
i did i did i did rank

307
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:38,550
you know and it's also so cute

308
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:40,470
colossal waste of money it sure shocks

309
00:10:40,496 --> 00:10:41,610
but i mean it's all the stuff

310
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:43,290
that we know about his kids right

311
00:10:43,290 --> 00:10:44,430
yeah we all we all know that

312
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:45,750
kind of stuff and yet people still

313
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:48,090
smoke so so i think it would

314
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:50,070
be interesting if like someone got cancer

315
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:52,170
acer from something and said hey you

316
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:54,450
are one of the one in your

317
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,130
or three in ten people who is

318
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:57,900
going to get you know lung cancer

319
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,100
from this so you need to stay

320
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,120
away from it then i would go

321
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:02,190
oh okay great good tip well that's

322
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:04,800
you i'm saying it does i think

323
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,600
it also depends what age you're talking

324
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,650
we arguing clone

325
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:10,050
i want you to fight

326
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:12,480
morin you ain't going to be financed

327
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,835
finance yes that's why i asked about

328
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:16,500
the fines anyone had a vey recently

329
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:17,760
do you want to have one now

330
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:19,560
over a lot of room

331
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:21,480
hello a little bit of the above

332
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:23,220
i think it would also depend on

333
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:25,500
the age at which you're telling the

334
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:28,650
clone all these things that if they're

335
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:31,470
fifteen they're probably not going to fucking

336
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:32,760
listen to you even if it right

337
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:34,260
you from the windows of your clone

338
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:36,900
listened to you i think i think

339
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:39,900
maybe in your in the early

340
00:11:40,590 --> 00:11:43,140
twenties maybe you could you could get

341
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:45,120
through to them and say look i

342
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,770
have to tell you this now this

343
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:48,660
is the this year's what happened here's

344
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:49,980
what happened in my body and so

345
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:51,450
you're gonna get to like take care

346
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:52,950
of this exactly i think it should

347
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:55,530
be earlier because it's like hey you

348
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:56,760
know what here's how to wash your

349
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:59,190
face correctly like er here's how you

350
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:00,150
don't get like bags

351
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:03,120
under your eyes different though that's it's

352
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:03,720
okay

353
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:06,180
you know what i mean like yes

354
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:07,380
i think there's a lot as everyone

355
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:09,120
else everyone thinks when they're young oh

356
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,380
that's never going to happen to me

357
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:12,420
and then than it does right so

358
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:15,180
it's like hey at around ah you

359
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:16,560
know forty five you're gonna start getting

360
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,790
bags under your eyes so here's a

361
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:18,960
way to take care of it before

362
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:23,190
then which is teenage blood yes and

363
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:24,810
that's why you're lead even that blurred

364
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:25,050
and

365
00:12:25,142 --> 00:12:27,300
your eyes yeah you put it right

366
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:27,780
in your eyes

367
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,900
i it it's an eyewash station but

368
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,700
it's all blood it's all teenage blood

369
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:33,810
so cool

370
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:36,480
lauren what would you tell your clone

371
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:40,830
i mean i do think ah exercise

372
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:42,000
would be a big one but i

373
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,860
think like i just delayed that for

374
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:46,770
a long time than i liked exercising

375
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:48,210
once actually started doing it when i

376
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:51,090
was thirty and i liked the results

377
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:52,860
and i thought it was it felt

378
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:54,090
good for me and then i was

379
00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:56,700
like why did i never do this

380
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:57,600
like

381
00:12:58,110 --> 00:12:59,730
i bet you i was naturally skinny

382
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,290
yeah and i mean

383
00:13:02,619 --> 00:13:05,400
look i still am but i like

384
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:08,670
having muscles and if if you could

385
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:10,710
be one of those bodybuilder types who's

386
00:13:10,713 --> 00:13:12,390
in the string bikinis with the huge

387
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:13,200
muscles with you

388
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:17,244
yeah and you know what i would

389
00:13:17,244 --> 00:13:19,170
i would almost have my pandemic my

390
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:21,240
current self tell my beginning of pandemic

391
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,620
self some stuff because i feel like

392
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:24,930
that would yeah oh yeah yeah just

393
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:27,570
like hey don't abandon everything you know

394
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:29,520
and like like it's like we are

395
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,020
but we already knew that and it's

396
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:33,900
like my feeling about i'm finally at

397
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:34,470
a place where i'm

398
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:35,820
i'm i'm lodi

399
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:38,580
what does that mean

400
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:43,080
does it mean simply discussed what

401
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:49,140
ignored heavily discussed here yard acknowledge accept

402
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:52,230
it i'll extend um i was i

403
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:53,190
finally got to a place where i

404
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:55,230
was like look you're just fucking doing

405
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:57,630
the best you can you can't like

406
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,790
of course there's a million things that

407
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:02,460
i wish that i had the i

408
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:04,350
wish i had the emotional strength to

409
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:04,470
do

410
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:06,690
do during this last year but i

411
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:08,580
just didn't i just yeah and you

412
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:11,370
know and so i don't know that

413
00:14:11,796 --> 00:14:12,990
like already knew all the things i

414
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:14,640
should have done you know or that

415
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,050
would have been beneficial for me yeah

416
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:17,190
and i mean i just couldn't watch

417
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:18,870
what's happening it's true because i was

418
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:20,340
like i if i could just do

419
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:21,810
this and i'd be good and i

420
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:24,450

yeah it only want to see an

436
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:50,100
audience yeah but like even just things

437
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:50,790
like that where it's like

438
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:52,050
like oh i if i just did

439
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:55,110
this five minute thing every day i

440
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:56,790
would have something to show for it

441
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:58,410
which is a five minute thing that

442
00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:00,240
you could do every day and still

443
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,740
have some like even you know what

444
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:03,000
i mean like when i hear something

445
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:03,930
like that i'm like oh if you

446
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:05,700
do this just five minutes a day

447
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:08,430
this will happen there's nothing right even

448
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:10,080
exercising if you do something five minutes

449
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:10,890
a day is nothing

450
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:13,170
gonna happen or even like something like

451
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:15,900
if you were placed one bad snack

452
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:17,220
with a good snack once a day

453
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:20,070
for five like for like just a

454
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:21,300
simple way of doing it where it's

455
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,980
not like a full overhaul or expecting

456
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:25,110
yourself to do a hundred different things

457
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:26,587
but but that's but my point is

458
00:15:26,587 --> 00:15:28,290
is you you like i don't think

459
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:29,820
there's anything you can do for just

460
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:30,840
five minutes a day

461
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,250
i think it's gotta be at least

462
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:34,560
a half hour like you you're practicing

463
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:36,891
guitar or exercising or anything like that

464
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:38,310
like it's gotta you gotta take a

465
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:39,930
half hour a day and then you

466
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:41,280
can get better at something but usually

467
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,900
it's like hours and hours you gotta

468
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,490
like the people who are amazing at

469
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:48,120
guitar spent their entire teenage years sitting

470
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:50,340
in their in their bedrooms just practising

471
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:51,270
scales over and

472
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:52,590
over and over and over and over

473
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:55,800
you know yeah i mean it's it's

474
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,600
really just a matter if i think

475
00:15:57,630 --> 00:15:59,010
saying five minute today is just a

476
00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:00,210
way to get yourself to do it

477
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:01,680
and once you actually start liking the

478
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,480
thing are getting better you would naturally

479
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,820
dedicate more time to it like when

480
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:08,010
i started my piano app for two

481
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:09,360
weeks that i did during the pandemic

482
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,530
which i'm really proud of for the

483
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:11,430
time that lasted

484
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:13,230
i was doing ten minutes but then

485
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:15,120
it would grow and grow to like

486
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,470
thirty or forty minutes i'm like oh

487
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:17,490
so much time has passed i just

488
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:20,040
was playing the song and then i

489
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:21,690
think like oh that was like it

490
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:23,190
felt like i actually did something and

491
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:24,390
it was good for my brain and

492
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:25,770
then i just stopped you know because

493
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:28,290
depression is not you the idea is

494
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:29,670
not you only do it for five

495
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:31,170
minutes it's like do at least five

496
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:31,560
minutes

497
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:33,330
no there's there are things out there

498
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:34,860
like exercising where it's like if you

499
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:36,480
just do this five minutes a day

500
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,670
you'll lose thirty pounds it's like well

501
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:39,990
what does what does

502
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:43,950
there's no one pound of your body

503
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:48,360
ah

504
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,340

the shoulders

511
00:17:09,330 --> 00:17:10,710
oh my bad you're gonna regret it

512
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:14,040
buy some concealer it's preventative measures now

513
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,060
that this is in a case where

514
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:16,830
their personality is whatever it is this

515
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:18,360
isn't like a person who's gonna undergo

516
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:20,070
my own experiences and all that so

517
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:22,350
it's just like purely a like hey

518
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:25,860
you put your you probably like okay

519
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:28,080
so you're fifteen right now go hang

520
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:29,430
out in the in the

521
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:31,410
the the gym at your high school

522
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:33,990
and i mean we all know more

523
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:36,600
oh it also like you don't have

524
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,030
to drink like soda every day and

525
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:40,620
milk every day like there's better ways

526
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:41,850
to eat although we all know that

527
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:43,620
stuff now way better than we did

528
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:45,810
back when the opponent probably know that

529
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:47,190
yeah the clone would know all that

530
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:48,180
so it's just like you know what

531
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,140
probably know that

532
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:53,430

00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:54,840
hard on yourself your family has a

534
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,700
history of depression ah don't

emotional stuff for sure for sure you

536
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,760
know but it goes because when you

537
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,350
when i was a kid the only

538
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:07,800
kind of thing that anyone ever said

539
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,990

555
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:47,130
don't know that i even regret it

556
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:48,930
and think it was fine i do

557
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,100
you know that all of our me

558
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:50,550
you would

559
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:54,360
that is one thing where it was

560
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:58,170
like literally until i was twenty seven

561
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:01,020
twenty eight i think i ate fast

562
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:03,300
food every meal and it was over

563
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:05,130
that it was pretty extreme it was

564
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:08,430
literally like a burger and coke and

565
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:10,350
fries for every single meal and then

566
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:11,910
i remember like even the breakfast

567
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:14,670
best sandwich for browse no no but

568
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:15,360
you know what i mean i would

569
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:18,390
like cycle through taco bell and burger

570
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:20,430
places like for every single meal but

571
00:19:20,438 --> 00:19:21,480

572
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:24,810

hearing about modern birthday parties and i

594
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,320
guess this started one of the star

595
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:08,880
maybe in the nineties when people started

596
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,490
having kids that you would buy presents

like you know those blow horn things

611
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:40,410

612
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:42,780

heard it's just a who it's it's

620
00:20:57,690 --> 00:21:00,570
it seems so extravagant that

621
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:03,213
these that the every first of all

622
00:21:03,213 --> 00:21:06,180
is a million people right um right

623
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:08,220
coming here sawyer and all the parents

624
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:10,290
are there yeah that's that's that's a

625
00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:12,510
weird one to me i yeah and

626
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:15,090
when i was a babysitter famously i

627
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:17,640
always had to go to these events

628
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,560
and things and or even just play

629
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:20,730
dates after school with the other

630
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:22,890
or nanny and it's like normally you

631
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:24,750
just get dropped off at someone's house

632
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,578
and yeah plan and those parents are

633
00:21:26,578 --> 00:21:28,590
kind of the point yeah is that

634
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:30,330
you don't have to watch and talk

635
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:32,610
to birthday party for kids though is

636
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,080
is a lot of times an excuse

637
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,790
for the parents to see other parents

638
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:37,290
and hang out with them and it's

639
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:39,990
wine o'clock baby let me die feels

640
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:40,890
new slot

641
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:43,620
rich people yeah yeah to me i

642
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:45,600
feel like maybe it's not rich people

643
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,470
but i see a lot of it

644
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:47,790
on reality tv which is why i

645
00:21:47,790 --> 00:21:50,370
have that idea but i feel like

646
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:51,930
when i was growing up the idea

647
00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:53,520
is that you get a respite

648
00:21:54,570 --> 00:21:56,130
an arrest from the kids

649
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:59,370
that you get to be away from

650
00:21:59,370 --> 00:22:01,050
them yeah and they go to a

651
00:22:01,050 --> 00:22:02,550
party for three hours and you've got

652
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:04,530
them up but but i think that's

653
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:05,790
so that's what i mean by some

654
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:07,500
birthday parties it's like okay the kids

655
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:08,910
are all being entertained over here by

656
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:11,220
the whatever and meanwhile all of the

657
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:12,780
adults are just kind of hanging out

658
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:14,670
talking amongst themselves it's more like a

659
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:16,560
split party if that makes it sounds

660
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:17,370
kind of fun as

661
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:18,810
as an die the way split partner

662
00:22:18,810 --> 00:22:20,280
i think that's something if you learned

663
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,540
how to do it we can have

664
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:22,980
a split party over at your house

665
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:24,690
well i'd love it if everyone so

666
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:26,670
do i like drama forum am i

667
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:27,900
just getting up and doing the splits

668
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:29,733
for you realise is gonna do that

669
00:22:29,733 --> 00:22:31,020
and then we watch the movie split

670
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:31,890
open

671
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:34,500
what it should be is that we

672
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:36,840
each have sixty days when i extend

673
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,190
the challenge to learn how to do

674
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,720
the splits i only have a sigh

675
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,610
and then we never drop a spell

676
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:43,560
that's why it's funny and then we

677
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:46,200
have parties why it's fun each always

678
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,720
says the best knish yeah

679
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:53,580
this this was always yeah that actually

680
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:55,440
is really it would be really funny

681
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,330
to judge work everyone would take out

682
00:22:57,330 --> 00:22:58,770
a tape measure to see how close

683
00:22:58,770 --> 00:23:01,050
their balls were to you you have

684
00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:02,550
to you you will work on it

685
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:03,900
you stretch every day so it's not

686
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:04,770
going to be your go to the

687
00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:07,230
hospital you just slamming your balls into

688
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:09,720
the daughter we nude yes

689
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:11,790
well no you're in c from you

690
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:13,560
know nude from the waist down because

691
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:17,040
we oh actually your crutches go into

692
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:19,290
the upstairs shirts on yeah because some

693
00:23:19,290 --> 00:23:21,060
people might wear really baggy pants that

694
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:23,490
are like sagging down in there it

695
00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:25,320
looks like their splits look better yeah

696
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:27,600
yeah i'd wear my juicy ripens

697
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,290
this was always my lie to me

698
00:23:31,290 --> 00:23:33,780
though though in being in musical theater

699
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:35,880
is is like i i'm not ah

700
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:37,770
very dexterous in that way like i

701
00:23:37,770 --> 00:23:40,560
have long legs but they they are

702
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:42,960
no and they don't bend that way

703
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,060
and so anytime you chopstick anytime you

704
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:46,200
would have to like that doesn't have

705
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,030
all those anytime you would have to

706
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:48,526
spread

707
00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:50,640
your legs and like stretch or or

708
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,200
do dances where it's like you're doing

709
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,400
the splits or whatever i'd be like

710
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:56,310
i just can't bend that way and

711
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:58,050
it's fair but but for the swiss

712
00:23:58,052 --> 00:23:59,070
party you're going to have to work

713
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:00,690
on it every day for five minutes

714
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:03,390
for sixty days okay so in sixty

715
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:04,830
days from today we're having to split

716
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:05,329
party over

717
00:24:06,810 --> 00:24:08,310
yeah and i'm going to get a

718
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:10,770
platform built um for it so it's

719
00:24:10,770 --> 00:24:12,510
gonna be i'll figure out who the

720
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:14,490
telus person coming is and then i

721
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:17,700
will platform from foot to foot yeah

722
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:19,450
of what if we did a think

723
00:24:19,452 --> 00:24:21,720
perfect split going straight down not the

724
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,160
tallest person but the person with the

725
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:24,810
longest legs and i see yeah could

726
00:24:24,810 --> 00:24:26,520
be an unfinished piece of wood so

727
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:26,730
that

728
00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:28,710
it will be difficult to theirs you

729
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:31,140
can't slide on it because you can't

730
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:33,450
put a good face to enter without

731
00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:37,050
split exactly so if like if tall

732
00:24:37,056 --> 00:24:38,459
john's gonna come though his legs are

733
00:24:38,459 --> 00:24:41,550
probably longer than yours nobody wins i'd

734
00:24:41,550 --> 00:24:42,780
love to go leg to leg with

735
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:44,340
him will be you know there it

736
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:45,570
seems so isn't it funny when you

737
00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:46,860
have friends who have

738
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:49,380
like where your proportions are totally different

739
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:50,550
like your very different heights but then

740
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:51,540
when you sit down you're the same

741
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:53,790
height or whatever because a long torso

742
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:56,640
yeah it's always funny it's so fun

743
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:00,660
hearing a tray a true fun guys

744
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:05,760
whereas this poly trends hours of polls

745
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:10,200

746
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:10,610
that to me

747
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:15,930
um when baby showers started to become

748
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:18,630
parties yeah it was not just like

749
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:21,090
an afternoon thing where here's all the

750
00:25:21,090 --> 00:25:23,520
expensive baby shit that you need when

751
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,960
it became like hey come on over

753
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:27,720

822
00:27:50,587 --> 00:27:52,320

no i don't that seems to me

839
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:33,600
like a person just looking for excuses

840
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,730
to have parties yeah i think so

841
00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:37,050
and i think you know it kind

842
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:39,780
of connect citing two ways learning bit

843
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:40,500
where

844
00:28:41,670 --> 00:28:45,240
like people who are just living their

845
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,470
lives it's a nice day to get

846
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:48,390
a lot of attention and i understand

847
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:49,320
it for that reason like it's a

848
00:28:49,323 --> 00:28:51,540
fun celebration to get together and have

849
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:53,880
that moment and it's a celebration bitches

850
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:54,720
but

851
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:58,920
do you definitely don't need pyrotechnics yeah

852
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:00,450
i mean i feel like it's i

853
00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:02,430
think it's proof i get why we're

854
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,680
we're moving on from them in general

855
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:05,670
but i also think like well if

856
00:29:05,670 --> 00:29:06,660
you want to cut a cake that

857
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:08,310
has a color inside it doesn't really

858
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:10,230
drive me crazy as long as there's

859
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:13,260
no fireworks in the cake yeah i

860
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:15,420
don't want to eat fireworks and frosting

861
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:17,430
i think that we've talked about this

862
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:19,830
before about wedding stuff like it's like

863
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:21,990
party things are real it's a real

864
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:24,387
racket like they're inventing things yeah so

865
00:29:24,387 --> 00:29:26,670
that they can sell shit we'll talk

866
00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:28,800
about how the woman who invented gender

867
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,260
reveal parties regrets it yeah yes yes

868
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:32,640
yeah here's something i was thinking of

869
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:34,440
yesterday because she got the wrong gender

870
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:35,580
um

871
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:41,340
okay so i think the yearly cycle

872
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:43,530
that discussed yesterday thoughts this is my

873
00:29:43,530 --> 00:29:45,810
yesterday yes today yea i had a

874
00:29:45,810 --> 00:29:49,740
thought yesterday um i think the yearly

875
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:52,590
cycle that we're on for events is

876
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:56,040
too short okay i think

877
00:29:56,280 --> 00:30:00,330
the game more days birthdays your what

878
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:01,440
if it gotta be like

879
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:04,140
you know like can we have them

880
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,030
eighteen months apart you know what i

881
00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:09,810
mean like valentine's day two you're saying

882
00:30:09,870 --> 00:30:11,310

883
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:13,740
every year but don't you you got

884
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:15,690
yes just no i don't i don't

885
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,670
agree with your yesterday it's not because

886
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,590
i think that it should be once

887
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:21,300
a year because it's nice to feel

888
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:22,650
the passage of time in that so

889
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:25,020
like science it's the one exception i

890
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:26,370

00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:28,860

923
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:30,690
me how people decorate for cr

924
00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:32,670

927
00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:40,770
a robot yeah and i also my

928
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,080
biggest pet peeve in the whole world

929
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:45,000
is that people don't take down their

930
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,530
christmas lights after christmas is over and

931
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:48,840
they're hanging year-round and a my belief

932
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:49,770
is that if you're gonna leave your

933
00:31:49,770 --> 00:31:50,850
fucking christmas lights up

934
00:31:50,850 --> 00:31:51,870
all year round you better turn them

935
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:54,810
on every night yeah might as well

936
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:57,060
right yeah i want some joy if

937
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:59,370

1026
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,650
easter i think mother's day and father's

1027
00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:04,200
day mother names you combine them not

1028
00:35:04,290 --> 00:35:05,820
i'm buying them but they should be

1029
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:07,530
a week apart i think i think

1030
00:35:07,530 --> 00:35:08,970
having them like you have to go

1031
00:35:08,970 --> 00:35:11,130
to this your parents two weeks in

1032
00:35:11,130 --> 00:35:13,650
a row no thank you you don't

1033
00:35:13,650 --> 00:35:15,720
have to yeah i do that easter

1034
00:35:15,930 --> 00:35:17,280
i think what we would we jumped

1035
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:19,740
ahead too much i think easter is

1036
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:22,320
good because he's your term is like

1037
00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:24,450
you have excuse to see your

1038
00:35:24,450 --> 00:35:25,980
a family in the spring german put

1039
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:27,360
on a nice outfit by the way

1040
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:29,760
really britain here's my here's my other

1041
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:31,590
opinion on this for kids it can

1042
00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:33,090
be once a year stuff like christmas

1043
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:34,260
and easter and stuff like that because

1044
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:35,370
a lot of these holidays are for

1045
00:35:35,370 --> 00:35:36,857
kids you know what i mean and

1046
00:35:36,970 --> 00:35:38,760
be able to take easter so we're

1047
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,140
also kind of lumping and things that

1048
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:41,850
aren't really that's why i think easter

1049
00:35:41,850 --> 00:35:43,710
should go back to being solely a

1050
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:44,610
religious holiday

1051
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,710
and it should not if you're not

1052
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:48,750
religious you can't celebrate it if you're

1053
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:50,790
not religious can celebrate it but you

1054
00:35:50,790 --> 00:35:52,650
have to take a religious purity test

1055
00:35:53,010 --> 00:35:54,750
yeah it shouldn't be a corporate like

1056
00:35:54,810 --> 00:35:56,820
about like how you know how how

1057
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,385
so commercial like how yes exactly bank

1058
00:35:59,385 --> 00:36:01,680
isn't eggs and everyone yeah so present

1059
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:04,770
okay oh representation should be christ on

1060
00:36:04,770 --> 00:36:06,300
on the cross arising from death

1061
00:36:07,170 --> 00:36:08,850
okay so okay mother's day and father's

1062
00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:10,740
day make them on the same day

1063
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:13,050
and they'll get this exactly six months

1064
00:36:13,050 --> 00:36:15,810
away from from christmas so that if

1065
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,280
you only have to visit your parents

1066
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,500
twice a year i haven't amendment okay

1067
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,690
make make mother's and father's day on

1068
00:36:21,690 --> 00:36:24,900
a saturday and sunday so ok want

1069
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:26,280
to get a weekend go home for

1070
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:27,300
if you if you visit

1071
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:29,100
family you go home for a weekend

1072
00:36:29,130 --> 00:36:31,140
okay no i'm i'm an upper pitch

1073
00:36:31,350 --> 00:36:33,210
okay mother's day and father's day should

1074
00:36:33,210 --> 00:36:35,880
be um decided on by the individual

1075
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,530
families because not everyone has a mother

1076
00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:39,300
or father and we don't need to

1077
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:40,410
make it a national thing where everyone

1078
00:36:40,410 --> 00:36:42,630
feels bad about themselves okay and instead

1079
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:44,160
if you want to celebrate that you

1080
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,600
go every year in our family we

1081
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,490
do mother's day on july third

1082
00:36:47,490 --> 00:36:49,410
or whatever and they just okay to

1083
00:36:49,410 --> 00:36:51,390
add to this make it on their

1084
00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:53,400
burrows america is our father so the

1085
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:56,070
next day is america's birthday exactly make

1086
00:36:56,070 --> 00:36:58,350
it on their birthdays their mothers and

1087
00:36:58,350 --> 00:37:00,750
fathers birthdays because they get two days

1088
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:02,970
or once you become a parent your

1089
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:05,310
birthday is now mother's day father's day

1090
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:07,650
exactly and and then you have

1091
00:37:07,650 --> 00:37:10,320
have to celebrate your birthday six months

1092
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,240
away from christmas so that it's like

1093
00:37:12,570 --> 00:37:13,650
june twenty fifth

1094
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:17,070
june twenty fourth and twenty fifth the

1095
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:18,750
moms and the dads get those and

1096
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:20,040
they have to change their birthdays to

1097
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:20,250
that

1098
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:23,430
so then it's just you are making

1099
00:37:23,430 --> 00:37:26,190
those days actual holidays and then your

1100
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:28,590
birthday is what changes yes exactly you

1101
00:37:28,590 --> 00:37:30,330
should then a gigantic portion of the

1102
00:37:30,330 --> 00:37:32,850
population will now all have birthdays in

1103
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:35,460
june yes and what a wonderful month

1104
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:36,690
to have a birthday you can spend

1105
00:37:36,690 --> 00:37:37,770
it outside in the park

1106
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,829
alright so we have her day but

1107
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:42,870
really it's the dead of winter it's

1108
00:37:42,870 --> 00:37:45,330
true we have independence day july fourth

1109
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:48,150
i'm gonna say i'm skipping ahead to

1110
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:51,030
memorial day okay i think memorial memorial

1111
00:37:51,030 --> 00:37:53,070
day for four that's in may that's

1112
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:55,410
me that's me ah so what ah

1113
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:57,690
no we don't care about memorial day

1114
00:37:57,750 --> 00:37:59,010
memorial day also by the way

1115
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:01,080
a too close to mother's day for

1116
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:01,500
comfort

1117
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:06,270
i'm gonna say memorial day is more

1118
00:38:06,390 --> 00:38:09,630
is a more important thing to observe

1119
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:12,540
and because it's so similar to fourth

1120
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:13,920
of july in terms of you like

1121
00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:16,200
switch the fireworks over to memorial day

1122
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:19,380
i'm saying kind of fold them into

1123
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:20,880
each other you get rid of or

1124
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:22,770
or we move memorial day

1125
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,030
to the fourth of july and we

1126
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:26,610
celebrate memorial day on this is better

1127
00:38:26,610 --> 00:38:28,410
and so that orange day memorial day

1128
00:38:28,410 --> 00:38:30,930
presidents day for the july august one

1129
00:38:30,990 --> 00:38:32,850
yes because like the the the fourth

1130
00:38:32,850 --> 00:38:34,530
of july celebrations that you go to

1131
00:38:34,530 --> 00:38:35,790

when you go to a party on

1171
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,740

00:40:15,930 --> 00:40:17,310
you know can still be the same

1181
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:19,740
the food's the same and would it

1182
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:21,990
would the food grow everywhere in the

1183
00:40:21,990 --> 00:40:23,730
world you know the same like

1184
00:40:24,375 --> 00:40:26,295

you can can have it or we

1186
00:40:28,065 --> 00:40:29,325

1187
00:40:29,325 --> 00:40:31,635
not meant to play god but he

1188
00:40:31,635 --> 00:40:34,185
does it because he wasn't meant to

1189
00:40:34,185 --> 00:40:37,695
do it so september you're saying like

1190
00:40:37,725 --> 00:40:39,735
after labor day we have thanksgiving than

1191
00:40:39,735 --> 00:40:41,025
a month later yeah labor day is

1192
00:40:41,025 --> 00:40:42,135
just a day off is just a

1193
00:40:42,135 --> 00:40:43,395
day off and we have thanksgiving then

1194
00:40:43,395 --> 00:40:44,535
a month later we have halloween

1195
00:40:44,535 --> 00:40:45,975
mean and then we get a nice

1196
00:40:45,975 --> 00:40:50,055
mum fifty five day break until christmas

1197
00:40:50,235 --> 00:40:51,645
yeah i don't know it's not bad

1198
00:40:51,735 --> 00:40:52,305
i like yeah

1199
00:40:53,655 --> 00:40:55,605
okay i think to have that break

1200
00:40:55,605 --> 00:40:57,525
in november would be really nice to

1201
00:40:57,525 --> 00:40:59,535
not have to worry about anything you

1202
00:40:59,535 --> 00:41:01,335
also that then y'all it's also not

1203
00:41:01,335 --> 00:41:04,875
like jump jamming up to family holidays

1204
00:41:04,875 --> 00:41:06,285
so close to each other and just

1205
00:41:06,285 --> 00:41:08,385
get rid of thanksgiving all together because

1206
00:41:08,385 --> 00:41:11,985
yeah why reasons related to history but

1207
00:41:11,985 --> 00:41:13,575
also the foods on even that good

1208
00:41:13,575 --> 00:41:16,545
good i like the food i i

1209
00:41:16,545 --> 00:41:18,135
like the getting together with family i

1210
00:41:18,135 --> 00:41:20,865
think we need to rehabilitate thanksgiving and

1211
00:41:20,865 --> 00:41:23,385
make it about ah first of all

1212
00:41:23,385 --> 00:41:25,515
columbus family family needs needs to go

1213
00:41:25,515 --> 00:41:27,135
away right somebody needs to go away

1214
00:41:27,225 --> 00:41:29,415
thanksgiving needs to be a celebration of

1215
00:41:29,415 --> 00:41:32,445
indigenous people ah where we all we

1216
00:41:32,445 --> 00:41:33,735
gather with family and

1217
00:41:33,765 --> 00:41:35,445
we are thankful for the fact that

1218
00:41:35,805 --> 00:41:38,745
we exist here um and we have

1219
00:41:38,745 --> 00:41:41,655
to also acknowledge that we reside on

1220
00:41:41,655 --> 00:41:44,685
stolen land etc etc um but it

1221
00:41:44,685 --> 00:41:47,235
should be a celebration of bitches the

1222
00:41:47,265 --> 00:41:49,575
the first people in america rather than

1223
00:41:49,935 --> 00:41:52,335
ah just like ah of that's all

1224
00:41:52,365 --> 00:41:53,895
like the sole the sole focus

1225
00:41:54,435 --> 00:41:55,905
how do we america how do we

1226
00:41:55,905 --> 00:41:59,775
celebrate the indigenous people like you want

1227
00:41:59,775 --> 00:42:01,335
it to be as big as as

1228
00:42:01,335 --> 00:42:03,435
fourth of july fireworks like something like

1229
00:42:03,435 --> 00:42:05,865
fireworks or what how do you you

1230
00:42:05,865 --> 00:42:07,608
know i'm saying like i think i

1231
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:09,015
think to be a moment of silence

1232
00:42:09,255 --> 00:42:10,305
i think that feels like you're just

1233
00:42:10,305 --> 00:42:12,555
having your own holiday and like giving

1234
00:42:12,555 --> 00:42:14,055
a cursory nod to

1235
00:42:14,055 --> 00:42:15,885
do it yeah well i mean memorial

1236
00:42:15,885 --> 00:42:17,325
day what are people doing like you

1237
00:42:17,325 --> 00:42:18,855
can turn on the tv and see

1238
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:21,315
ah you know moments of silence various

1239
00:42:21,315 --> 00:42:24,195
places by firing hands yeah but real

1240
00:42:24,195 --> 00:42:25,695
life people are like grilling outside and

1241
00:42:25,695 --> 00:42:27,255
shit you know yeah so i think

1242
00:42:27,255 --> 00:42:29,415
that i think that there's many ah

1243
00:42:29,475 --> 00:42:32,475
native american traditions that we could research

1244
00:42:32,505 --> 00:42:33,851
that we could oh yeah like what

1245
00:42:33,851 --> 00:42:34,215
bring

1246
00:42:34,284 --> 00:42:35,085
to the truth

1247
00:42:35,925 --> 00:42:37,665
oh oh you said that we can

1248
00:42:37,665 --> 00:42:38,475
research okay

1249
00:42:40,035 --> 00:42:40,485
like what

1250
00:42:42,075 --> 00:42:46,485
what's your your research einstein ah okay

1251
00:42:46,485 --> 00:42:47,865
look that would be i think there

1252
00:42:47,865 --> 00:42:50,985
should be a a a yearly you

1253
00:42:50,985 --> 00:42:54,585
know observance from and tribute to native

1254
00:42:54,585 --> 00:42:55,905
man we could call it even we

1255
00:42:55,905 --> 00:42:57,165
could even call it like instead of

1256
00:42:57,165 --> 00:42:59,325
thanksgiving we could call it like history

1257
00:42:59,325 --> 00:43:01,815
day where we you know like

1258
00:43:02,925 --> 00:43:06,675
where honestly reflect yeah you know history

1259
00:43:06,705 --> 00:43:09,225
like past present and future day where

1260
00:43:09,225 --> 00:43:10,845
we think about the past we think

1261
00:43:10,845 --> 00:43:12,195
about the present with our family and

1262
00:43:12,195 --> 00:43:13,125
then we give a nod to the

1263
00:43:13,125 --> 00:43:14,325
future when we're all going to be

1264
00:43:14,325 --> 00:43:17,505

1351
00:46:36,765 --> 00:46:37,095
to make

1352
00:46:39,525 --> 00:46:41,775
oh no i was thinking of something

1353
00:46:41,925 --> 00:46:43,485
i was thinking of something that when

1354
00:46:43,485 --> 00:46:44,895
we were talking earlier about

1355
00:46:46,305 --> 00:46:48,165
about what my parents would say to

1356
00:46:48,165 --> 00:46:49,695
me okay so when i was growing

1357
00:46:49,695 --> 00:46:52,215
up they i guess were they did

1358
00:46:52,215 --> 00:46:53,325
not like the way that i was

1359
00:46:53,325 --> 00:46:55,815
eating food or something because they would

1360
00:46:55,815 --> 00:46:58,275
say like your table manners are horrible

1361
00:46:58,335 --> 00:47:00,615
um and this was the carrot that

1362
00:47:00,615 --> 00:47:03,165
they were dangling not the stick of

1363
00:47:03,165 --> 00:47:05,385
course but they were saying like what's

1364
00:47:05,385 --> 00:47:06,135
going to happen

1365
00:47:06,165 --> 00:47:08,445
when you get older and you go

1366
00:47:08,445 --> 00:47:10,365
out on a date and you have

1367
00:47:10,365 --> 00:47:13,785
terrible dinner matters like this you don't

1368
00:47:13,815 --> 00:47:16,965
get that snap yeah there there you

1369
00:47:17,025 --> 00:47:18,165
you won't smash

1370
00:47:28,065 --> 00:47:30,135
you want to smash don't she told

1371
00:47:30,135 --> 00:47:30,885
you what is best

1372
00:47:31,965 --> 00:47:34,725
well but i don't think that the

1373
00:47:34,755 --> 00:47:36,915
manners were that bad it was purely

1374
00:47:36,915 --> 00:47:38,625
like how i'm holding a fork and

1375
00:47:38,625 --> 00:47:39,195
a knife

1376
00:47:40,275 --> 00:47:41,655
it wasn't like ah you know what

1377
00:47:41,655 --> 00:47:43,185
i mean yeah it was only it

1378
00:47:43,185 --> 00:47:44,805
wasn't like i was chewing with my

1379
00:47:44,805 --> 00:47:46,155
mouth open or anything like that it

1380
00:47:46,155 --> 00:47:47,925
was purely the the one how did

1381
00:47:47,925 --> 00:47:50,985
you hold him well like this like

1382
00:47:50,985 --> 00:47:53,445
you'd have yeah just double burden it

1383
00:47:53,445 --> 00:47:54,675
just hurts

1384
00:47:55,815 --> 00:47:57,135
maybe you looked at him for tape

1385
00:47:57,135 --> 00:48:00,285
to my middle fingers like edward scissorhands

1386
00:48:00,315 --> 00:48:01,447
edward silverware hands sure

1387
00:48:03,225 --> 00:48:04,335
no it was i mean i don't

1388
00:48:04,335 --> 00:48:05,325
know it was probably like

1389
00:48:06,465 --> 00:48:07,725
you know i mean i mean first

1390
00:48:07,725 --> 00:48:09,705
of all i held a pencil and

1391
00:48:09,705 --> 00:48:12,555
a pen in a different way than

1392
00:48:12,555 --> 00:48:14,685
most kids do same with me and

1393
00:48:14,685 --> 00:48:15,975
i've actually been called out on it

1394
00:48:15,975 --> 00:48:18,435
from between two firms day with me

1395
00:48:18,645 --> 00:48:20,895
and the teachers tried tried to to

1396
00:48:20,895 --> 00:48:22,995
cure me of it and my point

1397
00:48:22,995 --> 00:48:25,965
was i was always drawing comics and

1398
00:48:25,965 --> 00:48:26,535
comic book

1399
00:48:26,535 --> 00:48:28,155
xxx and doing the the word balloons

1400
00:48:28,155 --> 00:48:30,195
really tiny and it's easier to do

1401
00:48:30,195 --> 00:48:31,485
that if you hold the pencil or

1402
00:48:31,485 --> 00:48:32,775
a pen like this that was my

1403
00:48:32,775 --> 00:48:35,445
excuse too and it was really no

1404
00:48:35,625 --> 00:48:37,395
okay i held my weirder and i

1405
00:48:37,395 --> 00:48:39,525
remember someone like some teachers aide like

1406
00:48:39,525 --> 00:48:41,295
trying to grip my hand like make

1407
00:48:41,295 --> 00:48:42,345
it go and i was like yeah

1408
00:48:42,405 --> 00:48:43,422
i still just hold it weird and

1409
00:48:43,422 --> 00:48:44,115
i don't care and i have good

1410
00:48:44,145 --> 00:48:46,499
handwriting yeah who cares well i have

1411
00:48:46,515 --> 00:48:46,695
tears

1412
00:48:46,695 --> 00:48:48,105
well handwriting but i hold my i'm

1413
00:48:48,105 --> 00:48:49,215
right handed but i hold my pen

00:48:49,215 --> 00:48:51,315
like a left-hander right

1415
00:48:52,605 --> 00:48:53,835
yeah i do it like this too

1416
00:48:53,835 --> 00:48:55,965
we're all holding our fingers but i

1417
00:48:56,047 --> 00:48:57,075
i do it like this too when

1418
00:48:57,075 --> 00:48:58,965
i want to write really small when

1419
00:48:58,965 --> 00:49:00,645
i when i'm doing cursive i can

00:49:00,645 --> 00:49:01,845
do it you know the other thing

1421
00:49:01,845 --> 00:49:03,525
but like writing really small it's easier

1422
00:49:03,525 --> 00:49:05,115
to do it like this actually i

1423
00:49:05,115 --> 00:49:05,625

1424
00:49:06,855 --> 00:49:08,745
oh interesting one and people if you

1425
00:49:08,745 --> 00:49:10,215

1426
00:49:10,215 --> 00:49:12,645
scott you've seen it um too many

1427
00:49:12,645 --> 00:49:13,905

1429
00:49:17,925 --> 00:49:19,545
funny writing with hall had a really

1430
00:49:19,545 --> 00:49:21,015
funny line in the between two ferns

1431
00:49:21,015 --> 00:49:22,215
movie and zack made me cut it

1432
00:49:22,215 --> 00:49:24,225
out i just want to say jealous

1433
00:49:24,255 --> 00:49:26,835
just no because it was abraham lincoln

00:49:26,835 --> 00:49:28,665
one yeah it was maybe too off

1435
00:49:28,665 --> 00:49:30,765
color or something and zach said no

1436
00:49:30,765 --> 00:49:32,145
that shouldn't be in the movie but

1437
00:49:32,205 --> 00:49:33,945
i that was my first choice and

1438
00:49:33,975 --> 00:49:35,145
email was it something it's

1439
00:49:35,175 --> 00:49:36,885
like i'm sorry we have to take

1440
00:49:37,155 --> 00:49:39,105
five hundred points away from roger because

1441
00:49:39,105 --> 00:49:42,345
he abraham lincoln was in fact assassinated

1442
00:49:42,345 --> 00:49:44,595
he did not dynasty or something like

1444
00:49:46,335 --> 00:49:49,035
hot button topic for zack so but

1445
00:49:49,095 --> 00:49:50,625

1485
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:29,650
been on a date and someone had

1486
00:51:29,650 --> 00:51:31,870
terrible table manners and it turned you

1487
00:51:31,870 --> 00:51:35,140
off i remember going on a date

1488
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:40,960
with someone who was had had anxiety

1489
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:42,340
about ordering

1490
00:51:43,540 --> 00:51:47,290
and like paralyzed by choice or by

1491
00:51:47,290 --> 00:51:50,770
low light menu through famine oh wow

1492
00:51:50,830 --> 00:51:55,060
and i found it somewhat charming because

1493
00:51:55,750 --> 00:51:57,100
they were older than me and i

1494
00:51:57,100 --> 00:51:59,140
was more poised in the situation that

1495
00:51:59,140 --> 00:52:02,800
they were um looking back i think

1496
00:52:02,860 --> 00:52:03,520
um

1497
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,860
that later became later became a problem

1498
00:52:05,860 --> 00:52:06,970
for me

1499
00:52:09,190 --> 00:52:10,990
i'm picturing like somebody that is totally

1500
00:52:10,990 --> 00:52:12,280
at ease talking with you at the

1501
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:13,870
table and then when the server goes

1502
00:52:13,870 --> 00:52:15,910
over huh i just went oh i

1503
00:52:15,910 --> 00:52:17,680
don't know i don't really remember how

1504
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:19,450
it's an upper chiefs but it was

1505
00:52:19,450 --> 00:52:20,950
kind of like that it was like

1506
00:52:21,670 --> 00:52:24,910
more like um just discomfort and and

1507
00:52:24,910 --> 00:52:26,410
later it became an issue because it

1508
00:52:26,590 --> 00:52:28,330
continued to be a problem

1509
00:52:28,330 --> 00:52:29,800
anytime you'd go out to a restaurant

1510
00:52:30,340 --> 00:52:31,682
yeah but also like i feel like

1511
00:52:31,690 --> 00:52:32,680
i was one of those things where

1512
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:35,260
i eventually taught him and i feel

1513
00:52:35,260 --> 00:52:39,340
like um my younger self thought that

1514
00:52:39,340 --> 00:52:40,390
was cool in a way that my

1515
00:52:40,420 --> 00:52:43,030
older self doesn't find interesting right right

1516
00:52:43,090 --> 00:52:44,680
where i would rather have be with

1517
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:46,630
someone who was comfortable

1518
00:52:51,250 --> 00:52:52,780
well it's because it's not just shame

1519
00:52:52,780 --> 00:52:55,240
anyone for their show but i understand

1520
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:57,130
it's like if you there is there's

1521
00:52:57,130 --> 00:52:59,020
a sort of thing where it's like

1522
00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:00,400
an i don't want to shame anybody

1523
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:02,380
either but it's like if you recognize

1524
00:53:02,380 --> 00:53:04,030
you have an issue but you're not

1525
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:05,620
you're just not doing anything about it

1526
00:53:06,070 --> 00:53:07,240
you're just saying like this is my

1527
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:07,780
problem

1528
00:53:07,930 --> 00:53:09,970
the end is like you can there's

1529
00:53:09,970 --> 00:53:11,560
gotta be something you can do to

1530
00:53:11,590 --> 00:53:13,090
you to mitigate it a little bit

1531
00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:14,740
to to make it so that it's

1532
00:53:14,740 --> 00:53:17,620
more comfortable for for you yourself i

1533
00:53:17,620 --> 00:53:18,760
don't know i wanna i wanna i

1534
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:20,530
don't wanna give a shout out my

1535
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:22,810
point is more is like yeah it

1536
00:53:22,810 --> 00:53:25,960
was more indicative of other things than

1537
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:28,090
i was able to tell

1538
00:53:28,145 --> 00:53:30,310
at the time right but it's like

1539
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:32,170
red flag you know it's like not

1540
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:33,910
it's not things like that aren't always

1541
00:53:33,910 --> 00:53:35,320
a red flag but in i feel

1542
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:36,400
like sitting in this case it was

1543
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:37,480
a red flag i want to give

1544
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:38,890
a shout out to all the people

1545
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:42,670
who have guided anyone in life through

1546
00:53:42,670 --> 00:53:44,680
a first-time experience that may have been

1547
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:46,330
uncomfortable for the other person but did

1548
00:53:46,330 --> 00:53:48,188
it with patience and taught

1549
00:53:48,250 --> 00:53:49,900
i'm something that they didn't know in

1550
00:53:49,900 --> 00:53:51,040
a way that didn't make them feel

1551
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:52,570
stupid and that's what i did how

1552
00:53:52,570 --> 00:53:54,730
bout it yes and i was great

1553
00:53:54,730 --> 00:53:56,500

1557
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:06,130

i but i agree that i had

1570
00:54:27,130 --> 00:54:28,990
i'm lucky that i had some people

1571
00:54:28,990 --> 00:54:30,580
be very patient with me over the

1572
00:54:30,580 --> 00:54:33,400
years because i was a late bloomer

1573
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:35,350
about a lot of things just like

1574
00:54:35,380 --> 00:54:36,970
i didn't know about how to do

1575
00:54:36,970 --> 00:54:39,130
shit in the world and i had

1576
00:54:39,130 --> 00:54:40,750
people who were um

1577
00:54:41,050 --> 00:54:43,180
very kind and and friends who are

1578
00:54:43,180 --> 00:54:47,890
extremely ah patient with my personal issues

like um that i'm sure i did

1580
00:54:49,930 --> 00:54:53,470
not express well or whatever but people

1581
00:54:53,470 --> 00:54:56,800
that were that were very empathic or

1582
00:54:56,800 --> 00:54:59,410
empathetic i should say right they're not

1583
00:54:59,590 --> 00:55:00,790
they can't read minds

1584
00:55:02,110 --> 00:55:03,730

troi counsel jameel the emotion the other

1589
00:55:13,780 --> 00:55:16,300
person is experiencing let me say this

1590
00:55:16,300 --> 00:55:19,180
about table manners is that they're largely

1591
00:55:19,180 --> 00:55:21,220
just made up you're not doing anything

1592
00:55:21,220 --> 00:55:21,370
wrong

1593
00:55:21,370 --> 00:55:22,750
rude if you hold your knife or

1594
00:55:22,750 --> 00:55:25,180
fork in a strong way yeah exactly

1595
00:55:25,330 --> 00:55:26,470
a big one is elbows on the

1596
00:55:26,470 --> 00:55:28,270
table like that's who gives a shit

1597
00:55:28,300 --> 00:55:29,590
that's just like the elbows on the

1598
00:55:29,590 --> 00:55:31,390
table that was a big one yes

1599
00:55:31,450 --> 00:55:32,620
oh but elbows on the tables like

1600
00:55:32,650 --> 00:55:33,820
you care at all

1601
00:55:34,780 --> 00:55:36,580
adults do it all the fucking yes

1602
00:55:36,610 --> 00:55:37,630
you did it feels like you're like

1603
00:55:37,630 --> 00:55:39,665
body on my elbows on yes exact

1604
00:55:39,665 --> 00:55:42,700
right now yes it's like whatever makes

1605
00:55:42,700 --> 00:55:46,000
your body comfortable she yeah yes exactly

1606
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,500
you're just likely going to do that

1607
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:49,540
one does you shouldn't look too at

1608
00:55:49,540 --> 00:55:50,860
ease at the table you're supposed to

1609
00:55:50,860 --> 00:55:52,960
be sitting with your back attached to

1610
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:54,490
the back of the chair yeah

1611
00:55:54,490 --> 00:55:56,650
yeah tens i also feel like there's

1612
00:55:56,650 --> 00:55:57,970
some of this is growing up as

1613
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,560
the son of a military person you

1614
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:01,600
know who oh sure what you know

1615
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:04,540
because i had like making bed ah

1616
00:56:04,570 --> 00:56:06,610
you know a certain way type of

1617
00:56:06,610 --> 00:56:08,410
thing about you wanna be like yeah

1618
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:10,840
exactly literally guy it was like bouncing

1619
00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:11,890
quarter off of it and do you

1620
00:56:11,890 --> 00:56:12,670
think you would be like that with

1621
00:56:12,670 --> 00:56:14,650
your kid like being like no because

1622
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:16,150
i don't care i'd stop why should

1623
00:56:16,150 --> 00:56:16,570
they

1624
00:56:17,890 --> 00:56:19,810
it's like i don't know i mean

1625
00:56:19,810 --> 00:56:21,070
if stuff i mean look i had

1626
00:56:21,070 --> 00:56:22,570
a very messy room when i was

1627
00:56:22,570 --> 00:56:25,030
a kid and a messy desk all

1628
00:56:25,030 --> 00:56:27,190
my teachers like basically anytime i was

1629
00:56:27,190 --> 00:56:28,330
done with something i would throw it

1630
00:56:28,330 --> 00:56:30,520
into a pile and then it would

1631
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:31,750
just sit there for months and months

1632
00:56:31,780 --> 00:56:33,760
right so that would drive me insane

1633
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:36,010
yes if i were to go back

1634
00:56:36,430 --> 00:56:37,930
and do stuff again i would probably

1635
00:56:37,930 --> 00:56:39,250
you do that differently you know one

1636
00:56:39,250 --> 00:56:40,360
thing i was thinking about is is

1637
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:44,410
i would probably learn to ask more

1638
00:56:44,410 --> 00:56:47,860
questions about people from other backgrounds like

1639
00:56:47,860 --> 00:56:50,530
i had a a japanese friend who

1640
00:56:50,530 --> 00:56:51,610
i was thinking about the other day

1641
00:56:51,610 --> 00:56:54,700
when i was eight through you know

1642
00:56:54,730 --> 00:56:56,440
high school or whatever and i was

1643
00:56:56,440 --> 00:56:58,030
like you know i never really

1644
00:56:58,090 --> 00:57:01,630
dug in deep about you know him

1645
00:57:01,630 --> 00:57:03,190
coming from japan and what it was

1646
00:57:03,190 --> 00:57:04,540
like was life was like i was

1647
00:57:04,540 --> 00:57:06,190
just more concerned about my own stuff

1648
00:57:06,190 --> 00:57:07,390
you know i mean i feel like

1649
00:57:07,390 --> 00:57:08,410
a lot of kids are like that

1650
00:57:08,410 --> 00:57:12,190
though yeah yeah i guess but i'm

1651
00:57:12,190 --> 00:57:14,350
not i was i should essentially be

1652
00:57:14,380 --> 00:57:16,360
arrested yeah you're a bad guy

1653
00:57:17,890 --> 00:57:19,300
ah

1654
00:57:20,410 --> 00:57:23,530
my kids don't always know too that

1655
00:57:23,530 --> 00:57:25,150
it's okay to ask them things too

1656
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:29,080
yeah yeah sometimes kids feel self-conscious about

1657
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:30,970
asking so i think if i think

1658
00:57:30,970 --> 00:57:31,960
if i were ever to be a

1659
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:33,580
parent i would say like hey learn

1660
00:57:33,580 --> 00:57:35,950
to be interested in other people's lives

1661
00:57:35,950 --> 00:57:37,990
and ask ask questions instead of talking

1662
00:57:37,990 --> 00:57:39,940
about yourself that's a good that's a

1663
00:57:39,940 --> 00:57:40,540
lot that's kind of

1664
00:57:40,570 --> 00:57:42,280
used for a lot of people but

1665
00:57:42,290 --> 00:57:44,500
a lot of adults yes yeah but

1666
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:45,820
i think also it said it's tough

1667
00:57:45,820 --> 00:57:48,643
for kids to ask questions because that's

1668
00:57:48,643 --> 00:57:50,740
ah that's a thing that's like there's

1669
00:57:50,740 --> 00:57:52,450
a certain curiosity you develop as you

1670
00:57:52,450 --> 00:57:53,860
get older and you have more lived

1671
00:57:53,860 --> 00:57:56,770
experience that makes you more curious about

1672
00:57:56,800 --> 00:57:58,540
other things does that make sense yeah

1673
00:57:59,050 --> 00:58:00,730
right you you because

1674
00:58:00,730 --> 00:58:03,910
cause you you know you're so familiar

1675
00:58:03,910 --> 00:58:05,500
with your own experience by that point

1676
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:06,850
by the time you're you've lived on

1677
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:08,380
earth for a certain amount of time

1678
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:10,450
that you become just naturally more interested

1679
00:58:10,450 --> 00:58:12,040

1680
00:58:12,040 --> 00:58:15,310

00:59:59,170 --> 01:00:01,480
okay here's the game one person chooses

1728
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:02,620
a song and plays it from their

1729
01:00:02,620 --> 01:00:05,530
phone without saying what it is another

1730
01:00:05,530 --> 01:00:07,690
person has to improvise over the beginning

1731
01:00:07,690 --> 01:00:09,730
of the song like a radio host

1732
01:00:09,940 --> 01:00:12,250
right up until the lyrics start the

1733
01:00:12,250 --> 01:00:14,920
closer the improviser times the natural end

1734
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:16,420
of their monologue to the beginning the

1735
01:00:16,420 --> 01:00:18,550
lyrics the better if the improviser steps

1736
01:00:18,550 --> 01:00:19,210
on the lyrics

1737
01:00:19,210 --> 01:00:21,722
if they lose okay so this is

1738
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:23,290
a thing that d j zoo where

1739
01:00:23,290 --> 01:00:25,360
they are always are trying to figure

1740
01:00:25,360 --> 01:00:27,280
out like what's the latest i can

1741
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:29,650
talk until the lyrics start yes no

1742
01:00:29,650 --> 01:00:31,240
one wants them to do this no

1743
01:00:31,240 --> 01:00:33,460
but it's fun for them presumably i

1744
01:00:33,460 --> 01:00:35,260
used to by the way because i

1745
01:00:35,260 --> 01:00:36,640

1746
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:39,040

1749
01:00:42,190 --> 01:00:45,010

1754
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:55,060
it when a d j would talk

1755
01:00:55,060 --> 01:00:56,798

01:01:03,250 --> 01:01:05,050
fm and then the song would start

1761
01:01:05,050 --> 01:01:06,910
clean and then go all the way

1762
01:01:06,910 --> 01:01:08,140
to the end that was like gold

1763
01:01:08,140 --> 01:01:09,190

1764
01:01:09,220 --> 01:01:10,870
