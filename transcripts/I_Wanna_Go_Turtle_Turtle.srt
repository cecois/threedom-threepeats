137
00:04:46,362 --> 00:04:47,700
lot of men you know don't do

138
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:49,890
that in their relationship because our big

139
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:51,210

143
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:58,740
economy that he had a great idea

144
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:00,150
which is that he bought a couple

145
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:01,890

155
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:22,890
the personal like who's were these people

156

dropping by his place

157
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:27,060
yeah sort of the that's santa part

158
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:27,900
about that makes it feel a little

159
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:30,990
special is that no one ever gives

00:18:53,025 --> 00:18:55,035
that they don't exist in the bags

542
00:18:55,035 --> 00:18:57,495
they are a representation of a flair

543
00:18:57,525 --> 00:19:00,405
there there make they're having sex with

544
00:19:00,405 --> 00:19:02,535
other memes and creating these babies that

545
00:19:02,535 --> 00:19:03,345

them get bitten this toe there is

550
00:19:11,325 --> 00:19:12,615
one that has been this to me

551
00:19:12,615 --> 00:19:14,925
is like the movie cars in that

552
00:19:14,925 --> 00:19:16,995
there's such a fundamental problem with the

553
00:19:17,025 --> 00:19:20,025
with the concept that i can't get

554
00:19:20,025 --> 00:19:21,525
on board now what's wrong with the

555
00:19:21,525 --> 00:19:23,505

maybe they talk when i'm not looking

563
00:19:38,085 --> 00:19:39,735
toy story the main issue for me

564
00:19:39,735 --> 00:19:41,085
was at the beginning when that lamp

565
00:19:41,085 --> 00:19:42,555
bounced up and down and i was

566
00:19:42,555 --> 00:19:43,155
like yeah i'm out

567
00:19:43,665 --> 00:19:45,045
because that was way early in the

568
00:19:45,045 --> 00:19:46,425
movie that was like the first second

569
00:19:46,455 --> 00:19:47,835
yeah yeah it was just like fuck

570
00:19:47,835 --> 00:19:50,535
this wow their production card doesn't make

571
00:19:50,535 --> 00:19:52,065
anything what i think was gonna happen

572
00:19:52,065 --> 00:19:53,715
when you sat down well i thought

573
00:19:53,715 --> 00:19:55,275
a lamp would be stationary and just

574
00:19:55,275 --> 00:19:57,435
sitting there and maybe someone would turn

575
00:19:57,435 --> 00:19:58,485

645
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:34,640

that they were like nice you say

820
00:28:03,170 --> 00:28:05,120
so boring yeah i think also a

821
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,320
lot of things like that come about

822
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:09,410
from accidents k where they're trying to

823
00:28:09,410 --> 00:28:11,750
do something you're trying to cure polio

824
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:12,950
and they're like yeah they're trying to

825
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:13,820
always try

826
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:15,350
we have so many things from trying

827
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:18,650
to cure polio it's kinda brutal illegally

828
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:21,170
um but i but it's really like

829
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,880

00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:33,020
table but but it it led me

834
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:33,980
to wonder

835
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:35,990
being hungry for pinball have we figured

836
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:37,790
out everything at this point yep

837
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,950
well i wouldn't either though like getting

838
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:41,150
crazy with it now when you go

839
00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:42,500
to restaurant they're like we put

840
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,530
you know freeze dried sales on top

841
00:28:45,530 --> 00:28:46,940
of a pile of fake dirt that

842
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:48,800
yeah just because we've figured out everything

843
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,180
to do with everything now just like

844
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:53,480
trying to create there was a this

845
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:55,100

closed wanted to close in eighteen eleven

848
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:02,420

849
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,740
they invented everything right

850
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:06,680
that's what yeah yeah now that's just

851
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,660

com marimo tales

891
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:37,495
yeah well i'm sitting here i'm really

892
00:30:37,495 --> 00:30:38,875
gonna need things to just be named

893
00:30:39,085 --> 00:30:41,155
just fun i know i know just

894
00:30:41,155 --> 00:30:43,705
staples you know is a company but

895
00:30:43,705 --> 00:30:45,355
we never minded it because that was

896
00:30:45,355 --> 00:30:46,915
the original well you know yeah i

897
00:30:46,915 --> 00:30:47,815
think a lot of times i let

898
00:30:47,815 --> 00:30:49,195
companies slide if it was what i

899
00:30:49,195 --> 00:30:50,875
always was used to yeah it's a

900
00:30:50,875 --> 00:30:51,955
new company i'm not so happy i'm

901
00:30:51,955 --> 00:30:53,605
like if it's just one word but

902
00:30:53,605 --> 00:30:55,285
like saying a web address is so

903
00:30:55,315 --> 00:30:55,975
irritating

904
00:30:56,035 --> 00:30:56,875
no and i think it should be

905
00:30:56,875 --> 00:30:58,285
like the sparkle dome like i don't

906
00:30:58,285 --> 00:30:59,545
think it should have ended thing that

907
00:30:59,875 --> 00:31:01,705
works any also it should be the

908
00:31:01,705 --> 00:31:03,745
whatever forum like i don't mind that

909
00:31:03,775 --> 00:31:05,275
yeah i mean like if it's it

910
00:31:05,275 --> 00:31:07,555
shouldn't just be crypto and then arena

911
00:31:07,765 --> 00:31:10,015
i think it should be you know

912
00:31:10,015 --> 00:31:12,295
whatever the name of the building is

913
00:31:12,445 --> 00:31:15,385
sponsored by whatever yeah it's still powered

914
00:31:15,385 --> 00:31:16,045
by anybody

915
00:31:16,315 --> 00:31:18,325
the kid and it's like oh yeah

916
00:31:18,355 --> 00:31:19,585
crypto dot com is not going to

917
00:31:19,585 --> 00:31:20,755
be the name for the next fifty

918
00:31:20,755 --> 00:31:22,525
years they wouldn't get their money's worth

919

screen with a football game on that

1102
00:37:29,935 --> 00:37:31,435
sometimes people are taking a break and

1103
00:37:31,435 --> 00:37:33,337
watching a football game right but i

1104
00:37:33,362 --> 00:37:36,655
really love sports i really i really

1105
00:37:36,655 --> 00:37:38,245
enjoyed it and i was like oh

1106
00:37:38,349 --> 00:37:38,905
i will

1107
00:37:38,995 --> 00:37:40,705
probably watch basketball on tv now oh

1108
00:37:40,705 --> 00:37:43,885
wow okay and the sixers won that's

1109
00:37:43,915 --> 00:37:46,585
great the last that last minute of

1110
00:37:46,585 --> 00:37:48,025
play is like that's all you got

1111
00:37:48,025 --> 00:37:49,585
to see it's so wild well that's

1112
00:37:49,585 --> 00:37:51,138
why i've always said that basketball games

1113
00:37:51,138 --> 00:37:52,825
should just be one minute one shot

1114
00:37:53,275 --> 00:37:54,835
whoever gets it first oh you only

1115
00:37:54,835 --> 00:37:57,115
get one shot at halftime they have

1116
00:37:57,115 --> 00:37:59,155
people that they have like sort

1117
00:37:59,185 --> 00:38:00,655
a little obstacle course so people from

1118
00:38:00,655 --> 00:38:02,755
the crowd can like they have to

1119
00:38:02,755 --> 00:38:04,375
run through these things grab a basketball

1120
00:38:04,375 --> 00:38:06,835
shooter to get money yeah and so

1121
00:38:06,835 --> 00:38:08,575
the new guy does dot com no

1122
00:38:08,605 --> 00:38:10,825
no doubt the one guy was dunking

1123
00:38:10,855 --> 00:38:12,355
left and right he missed just like

1124
00:38:12,355 --> 00:38:14,155
the last two but he made these

1125
00:38:14,485 --> 00:38:16,315
like like trick dunks where he would

1126
00:38:16,885 --> 00:38:18,865
um you know bouncing on the floor

1127
00:38:18,865 --> 00:38:19,315
and then

1128
00:38:19,345 --> 00:38:21,295
catch it right yeah that's great oh

1129
00:38:21,295 --> 00:38:24,565
wow then the second guy did bad

1130
00:38:24,745 --> 00:38:26,185
since the first day also just an

1131
00:38:26,215 --> 00:38:27,895
audience member he wasn't like so he

1132
00:38:27,895 --> 00:38:29,785
was doing trick dunks yeah as an

1133
00:38:29,815 --> 00:38:31,255
audience member yeah and the other guy

1134
00:38:31,255 --> 00:38:32,905

1138
00:38:37,975 --> 00:38:39,475
imagine this is part of the

1139
00:38:39,475 --> 00:38:41,515
the thing like they've probably been doing

1140
00:38:41,515 --> 00:38:44,065

ah relatively close it was very fun

1195
00:40:30,325 --> 00:40:32,155
that's really fun yeah like it's very

1196
00:40:32,155 --> 00:40:33,175
exciting when you go with someone who

1197
00:40:33,175 --> 00:40:35,785
has close seats yeah i've had that

1198
00:40:35,785 --> 00:40:37,375
experience a few times and that makes

1199
00:40:37,375 --> 00:40:39,595
it feel really special because you're seeing

1200
00:40:40,685 --> 00:40:42,275
sweat on their faces and like all

1201
00:40:42,275 --> 00:40:44,045
that yeah assertions and everything that's really

1202
00:40:44,105 --> 00:40:46,445
i feel that sport in particular to

1203
00:40:46,445 --> 00:40:48,095
be down on the um on the

1204
00:40:48,095 --> 00:40:49,295
floor for it i can see how

1205
00:40:49,295 --> 00:40:50,478
exciting it would be like the best

1206
00:40:50,478 --> 00:40:51,815
eats i've read at a baseball game

1207
00:40:52,265 --> 00:40:57,245
was ah just to the ah left

1208
00:40:57,245 --> 00:40:59,735
of home plate oh yeah i would

1209
00:40:59,735 --> 00:41:00,785
like to see a little base

1210
00:41:00,785 --> 00:41:02,165
people gamer if i was really close

1211
00:41:02,165 --> 00:41:04,595
very exciting but not all of the

1212
00:41:04,595 --> 00:41:06,245
play happens there but if you're like

1213
00:41:06,275 --> 00:41:08,045
courtside and you're right there and they're

1214
00:41:08,045 --> 00:41:09,365
just going back and forth in this

1215
00:41:09,725 --> 00:41:13,055
one area yeah you're seeing fucking everything

1216
00:41:13,085 --> 00:41:14,435
yeah do you want to be by

1217
00:41:14,435 --> 00:41:15,455
a basket or do you want to

1218
00:41:15,455 --> 00:41:16,055
be halfcourt

1219
00:41:17,225 --> 00:41:18,270
yeah of course i guess would be

1220
00:41:18,425 --> 00:41:20,555
yes i feel like sat behind the

1221
00:41:20,555 --> 00:41:22,175
basket and that was kind of breaks

1222
00:41:22,175 --> 00:41:23,495
and you see them running towards you

1223
00:41:23,495 --> 00:41:24,725
and jumping up and stuff and you

1224
00:41:24,755 --> 00:41:26,135
get scared you're like oh and i'm

1225
00:41:26,135 --> 00:41:26,615
always growing

1226
00:41:27,635 --> 00:41:29,195
here's the thing i didn't know about

1227
00:41:29,255 --> 00:41:33,175
ah best professional basketball is that when

1228
00:41:33,335 --> 00:41:34,745
when the teams are down at one

1229
00:41:34,745 --> 00:41:36,335
end there's a guy at the other

1230
00:41:36,335 --> 00:41:39,965
end frantically mopping up the floor oh

1231
00:41:39,965 --> 00:41:42,455
wow i never remember notably yeah yeah

1232
00:41:42,487 --> 00:41:43,895
never occurred to me but a guy

1233
00:41:43,895 --> 00:41:44,585
runs out like

1234
00:41:45,665 --> 00:41:47,315
oh no yeah yeah gotta keep it

1235
00:41:47,315 --> 00:41:48,785
really shine because if one of the

1236
00:41:48,785 --> 00:41:51,965
players gets injured they'll sue yeah this

1237
00:41:51,992 --> 00:41:53,465
exactly you know i don't i like

1238
00:41:53,465 --> 00:41:55,475
it more in-person than watching on tv

1239
00:41:55,475 --> 00:41:56,855
because i feel like there's stay adds

1240
00:41:56,855 --> 00:41:59,135
so many distractions and like the talking

1241
00:41:59,135 --> 00:42:00,755
really worried about the there's a lot

1242
00:42:00,755 --> 00:42:02,885
of shit happening in other dads and

1243
00:42:02,885 --> 00:42:05,165
they were worried well started televised ads

1244
00:42:05,435 --> 00:42:05,825
yeah

1245
00:42:05,825 --> 00:42:08,345
yeah because the ads there's arriving on

1246
00:42:08,345 --> 00:42:09,785
the thing on the thing and then

1247
00:42:09,785 --> 00:42:12,395
every there's sleep or nothing rally you're

1248
00:42:12,395 --> 00:42:13,889
not hearing them like burger king is

1249
00:42:13,889 --> 00:42:15,455
number one place you're just like watching

1250
00:42:15,455 --> 00:42:17,645
exactly yeah but it is like this

1251
00:42:17,675 --> 00:42:19,805
because things are changing every two seconds

1252
00:42:19,865 --> 00:42:20,942
but that's to keep you in getting

1253
00:42:20,942 --> 00:42:23,495
really interesting with yeah i think it'd

1254
00:42:23,495 --> 00:42:25,295
be interesting to write down every ad

1255
00:42:25,295 --> 00:42:25,955
you see any

1256
00:42:25,985 --> 00:42:28,565
de fun you should do that yeah

1257
00:42:28,625 --> 00:42:29,855
okay report your findings

1258
00:42:31,055 --> 00:42:32,045
you have to leave this room now

1259
00:42:33,785 --> 00:42:35,015
weren't they afraid though when they started

1260
00:42:35,015 --> 00:42:36,695
televising games no one would ever want

1261
00:42:36,695 --> 00:42:38,285
to go in person anymore they said

1262
00:42:38,285 --> 00:42:40,625

00:52:17,695 --> 00:52:19,885
orangutan method to put on all of

1510
00:52:19,885 --> 00:52:22,195

a tasmanian tiger wow there's lot to

1515
00:52:32,995 --> 00:52:33,835
be they were thought to be

1516
00:52:33,865 --> 00:52:37,195
extinct for many years but somebody cited

1517
00:52:37,195 --> 00:52:39,355
one recently really that's a myth that

1518
00:52:39,355 --> 00:52:41,215
they were long-gone isn't it wild how

1519
00:52:41,215 --> 00:52:42,475
we you know they say we only

1520
00:52:42,475 --> 00:52:44,185
know like ten percent of what's happening

1521
00:52:44,185 --> 00:52:46,735
in the ocean or something yeah no

1522
00:52:46,735 --> 00:52:48,775
we keep track on ten percent know

1523
00:52:48,775 --> 00:52:50,485
there's something like there's it goes so

1524
00:52:50,602 --> 00:52:53,065
far down yeah we we we pass

1525
00:52:53,069 --> 00:52:54,025
any idea i've never

1526
00:52:54,055 --> 00:52:55,216
heard the ten percent lie made up

1527
00:52:55,235 --> 00:52:56,875
the number i've heard that for brains

1528
00:52:56,875 --> 00:52:58,045
which is also bullshit well that's what

1529
00:52:58,045 --> 00:52:59,335
i'm using to tell you this fact

1530
00:52:59,755 --> 00:53:00,985
what do i think about p twenty

1531
00:53:00,985 --> 00:53:03,685
four p twenty four xy the time

1532
00:53:03,715 --> 00:53:05,905
p twenty twenty two show some respect

1533
00:53:05,905 --> 00:53:07,735
and he's dead why do we think

1534
00:53:07,735 --> 00:53:09,325
about him why i find it odd

1535
00:53:09,325 --> 00:53:11,155
that everyone is so you know everyone

1536
00:53:11,155 --> 00:53:13,045
was like everyone and there was like

1537
00:53:13,045 --> 00:53:14,185
a yeah they were like p twenty

1538
00:53:14,425 --> 00:53:16,345
my funeral for animals like that it

1539
00:53:16,345 --> 00:53:18,145
was honestly confusing and i don't mean

1540
00:53:18,145 --> 00:53:20,605
that in an unfeeling way i just

1541
00:53:20,605 --> 00:53:22,495
agree with you i'm just like i

1542
00:53:22,525 --> 00:53:24,445
didn't really follow it that closely i

1543
00:53:24,445 --> 00:53:25,255
was kind of like oh there's a

1544
00:53:25,255 --> 00:53:26,875
mount land and then everyone's like p

1545
00:53:26,875 --> 00:53:28,405
twenty two was like my hero and

1546
00:53:28,405 --> 00:53:29,695
like everything he did was for me

1547
00:53:30,055 --> 00:53:32,185
it truly feels like something i want

1548
00:53:32,185 --> 00:53:34,345
to farther but i will say that

1549
00:53:34,795 --> 00:53:37,225
i did not follow the the antics

1550
00:53:37,225 --> 00:53:38,545
of p twenty two too closely but

1551
00:53:38,545 --> 00:53:39,565
every once in a while you'd hear

1552
00:53:39,565 --> 00:53:41,605
there was a sighting or whatever yeah

1553
00:53:41,605 --> 00:53:44,545

when i heard that he died i

1555
00:53:45,985 --> 00:53:47,395

00:56:54,265 --> 00:56:55,105
she was like

1643
00:56:56,455 --> 00:56:57,837
took her into the bathroom to show

1644
00:56:57,837 --> 00:56:59,605
her around there's a big ah cuckoo

1645
00:56:59,605 --> 00:57:02,425
clock above the toilet and that's how

1646
00:57:02,545 --> 00:57:03,715
good you really don't need that up

1647
00:57:03,715 --> 00:57:06,415
there yeah you don't need something well

1648
00:57:06,415 --> 00:57:07,615
you don't have to twist around to

1649
00:57:07,615 --> 00:57:09,085
look at the time was very help

1650
00:57:09,085 --> 00:57:10,405
you want to come over your head

1651
00:57:10,615 --> 00:57:11,994
and down in front of your eye

1652
00:57:11,994 --> 00:57:13,135
or if you're standing up after you

1653
00:57:13,135 --> 00:57:14,755
shit and then it's the clock strike

1654
00:57:14,869 --> 00:57:16,285
suddenly baja

1655
00:57:16,345 --> 00:57:18,625
back to your neighbor but then then

1656
00:57:18,625 --> 00:57:19,825
she was like she had the shower

1657
00:57:19,825 --> 00:57:21,475
curtain drawn and she pulled it and

1658
00:57:21,475 --> 00:57:22,555
there was just cat litter in the

1659
00:57:22,555 --> 00:57:25,105
bathtub well that's convenient and then cut

1660
00:57:25,105 --> 00:57:26,305
out the middleman oh maybe it was

1661
00:57:26,305 --> 00:57:28,465
cat food okay cool thanks you don't

1662
00:57:28,465 --> 00:57:30,205

00:57:30,205 --> 00:57:33,265
or just loose just loops and then

1664
00:57:33,265 --> 00:57:35,455
that's okay that's actually so disgusting but

1665
00:57:35,455 --> 00:57:36,355
then but then i

1666
00:57:36,565 --> 00:57:38,515

1673
00:57:53,245 --> 00:57:55,645

1675
00:57:56,665 --> 00:57:59,725
cuckoo clocks but everything else was clean

00:57:59,755 --> 00:58:02,005
beautiful pristine she had a whole brain

1677
00:58:03,655 --> 00:58:05,845

that's the one that's a cat though

1683
00:58:15,085 --> 00:58:16,315

felix ah okay i've had a few

1687
00:58:22,345 --> 00:58:24,355

i liked them but i've only had

1689
00:58:26,455 --> 00:58:27,865
blue book but i like what i've

1690
00:58:27,865 --> 00:58:29,725
only had one at a time and

1691
00:58:29,725 --> 00:58:31,315
mike got me one recently which i

1692
00:58:31,315 --> 00:58:32,545
was so happy to do already have

1693
00:58:32,545 --> 00:58:32,905
one now

1694
00:58:32,905 --> 00:58:33,775
no but haven't had one in a

1695
00:58:33,775 --> 00:58:35,275
long time it's like i don't know

1696
00:58:35,275 --> 00:58:37,345
what happened but i have one why

1697
00:58:37,345 --> 00:58:38,995

1698
00:58:38,995 --> 00:58:40,885
work anymore weren't weren't you getting another

1699
00:58:40,885 --> 00:58:43,105
one if you're gifted to me oh

1700
00:58:43,105 --> 00:58:44,845
and and because whoever rule you can

1701
00:58:45,355 --> 00:58:47,335
buy weight honestly feels like just if

1702
00:58:47,335 --> 00:58:49,195
you saw one and you were looking

1703
00:58:49,195 --> 00:58:50,275
for a present for me you'd be

1704
00:58:50,275 --> 00:58:52,225
like she'll like that it's like this

1705
00:58:52,255 --> 00:58:53,035
it makes sense and it

1706
00:58:53,065 --> 00:58:54,685
happens i mean somebody you do like

1707
00:58:54,715 --> 00:58:56,455
and die but when i hung it

1708
00:58:56,455 --> 00:58:57,805
up in the kitchen i thought i

1709
00:58:57,805 --> 00:59:00,085
want ten of these okay i need

1710
00:59:00,085 --> 00:59:02,635
ten and ended them all swinging now

1711
00:59:03,055 --> 00:59:04,585
and then i sat there for a

1712
00:59:04,585 --> 00:59:07,555
bit and realised you were so loud

1713
00:59:07,555 --> 00:59:08,845
that i was like if there's more

1714
00:59:08,905 --> 00:59:10,455
than one wow it was it's not

1715
00:59:10,465 --> 00:59:11,905
allowed but i could hear it as

1716
00:59:11,905 --> 00:59:12,895
i was sitting there eating and i

1717
00:59:12,895 --> 00:59:13,225
was like

1718
00:59:13,255 --> 00:59:14,755
just like his head and that would

1719
00:59:14,755 --> 00:59:16,495
be insane yeah yeah yeah but it

1720
00:59:16,495 --> 00:59:17,605
would look because you could never get

1721
00:59:17,605 --> 00:59:19,495
them all sync'd up you never could

1722
00:59:19,525 --> 00:59:20,605
and even if you could that be

1723
00:59:20,635 --> 00:59:23,665
maybe worse because be one loud tick

1724
00:59:23,665 --> 00:59:25,615
tock we have a cuckoo clock yeah

1725
00:59:25,615 --> 00:59:27,415

1774
01:01:15,990 --> 01:01:16,980
look up controversies

1775
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:21,600
first personal life the oxford english dictionary

1776
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:23,970
states that the popular eighteen seventy six

1777
01:01:23,970 --> 01:01:27,750
song my grandfather's clock is responsible for

1778
01:01:27,750 --> 01:01:30,180
the common name grandfather clock being applied

1779
01:01:30,180 --> 01:01:32,490
to the long case clock the song

1780
01:01:32,490 --> 01:01:34,980
was composed by an american songwriter by

1781
01:01:34,980 --> 01:01:37,140
the name of henry clay work who

1782
01:01:37,140 --> 01:01:38,340
discovered a long case clock

1783
01:01:38,370 --> 01:01:41,010
in the george hotel and pierce bridge

1784
01:01:41,340 --> 01:01:43,110
in county durham in england when he

1785
01:01:43,110 --> 01:01:44,940
asked about the clock he was informed

1786
01:01:44,940 --> 01:01:48,390
that it had two owners okay two

1787
01:01:48,390 --> 01:01:51,420
owners where they married after the first

1788
01:01:51,420 --> 01:01:53,190
owner die oh it'd had two owners

1789
01:01:53,190 --> 01:01:54,608
since i thought kahneman had sold

1790
01:01:58,170 --> 01:02:00,540
cut it in half yeah after the

1791
01:02:00,540 --> 01:02:03,360
first owner died the clock became inaccurate

1792
01:02:03,360 --> 01:02:04,680
and when the second owner died the

1793
01:02:04,680 --> 01:02:08,850
clock stopped working altogether the story inspired

1794
01:02:08,850 --> 01:02:10,830
henry to create the song grandfather clocks

1795
01:02:10,860 --> 01:02:13,020
are of a certain height usually at

1796
01:02:13,020 --> 01:02:15,300
least one point nine meters six feet

1797
01:02:15,300 --> 01:02:15,780
three inch

1798
01:02:15,780 --> 01:02:16,110
his

1799
01:02:17,670 --> 01:02:19,440
don't get it wrong there are also

1800
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:22,194
grandmother and granddaughter clubs so we talked

01:02:22,194 --> 01:02:25,470

thief why no grandson clock

i love my curvy clock um i

1809
01:02:39,630 --> 01:02:40,980

a song that's why we call birthday

1811
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:44,310
cakes birthday cakes because it comes from

1812
01:02:44,310 --> 01:02:46,650
the birthday song it's really disgusting to

1813
01:02:46,650 --> 01:02:48,630
be blowing candles out and yeah we

1814
01:02:48,630 --> 01:02:50,970
never knew it until the pandemic and

1815
01:02:50,970 --> 01:02:52,680
