191
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:36,540

192
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:38,012
them to disneyland whenever they visit and

193
00:06:38,012 --> 00:06:39,780
now it's been two years since yesterday

194
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:40,740
then so i'm like i gotta make

195
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:42,270

you know if you know um they're

198
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:48,030
nine and six about oh i forgot

199
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:49,350
you had to have to

200
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,110
yeah they're getting older there we go

201
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:54,630
but still prime disneyland oh even better

202
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:56,790
because now they can really enjoy it

203
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:58,800
yeah yeah yeah like two years ago

204
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:00,090
or they loved it but it's like

205
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:01,950
they always hit that wall where then

206
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:03,990
they get exhausted and like started crying

207
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:05,700
and stuff and it's like i think

208
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:07,290
nine and six you're kind of like

209
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:09,600
ready to yeah partei partei yeah we

210
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,700
the old style you went with alyssa

211
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:15,180
over here um no sister-in-law and ah

212
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,620
she was young enough that she really

213
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:19,020
wanted goofy's autograph oh i chase him

214
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:20,400
down for the autograph and goo for

215
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,810
my nephews who he was on like

216
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:23,580
crack or something because he kept like

217
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,830
he kept doing this dance like you

218
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:27,450

219
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:28,590
in he would like right away so

220
00:07:28,596 --> 00:07:29,700
that's pretty fun typical

221
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:30,840
behavior of people who are on crack

222
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:35,130
you can't catch me yeah i was

223
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:36,780
just a shit man about it down

224
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:39,660
multiple characters when i was there with

225
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,070
them like these because i wanted to

226
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,390
fill the autograph book because when i

227
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:44,130
was little that was a highlight of

228
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,090
the one time i went to disney

229
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:46,110
world as a kid right i didn't

230
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:47,160
even know this was a thing oh

231
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,000
i would look at it over and

232
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,590
over a guy like all their stamp

233
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:51,388
a special signatures each one so it

234
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:52,050
was like i like gotta

235
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,460
get em all but i'm gonna do

236
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:54,390
it again we gotta just do it

237
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:55,800
again and i wonder it must be

238
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:57,750
you have if you are that character

239
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,310
you have to learn that signature yes

240
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,740
maybe have some looking right at you

241
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:02,340

242
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:05,820
well i also know this you're you're

243
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:06,990

00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:09,780
just asking me ah well obviously i'm

245
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:11,310
i'm directing it at you so you

246
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:13,560

259
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:38,580

301
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:09,900
to look long before i ever had

302
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:12,480
a baby i was disneyland all the

303
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,800
time when i moved here i was

304
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,920
so confused because everyone in at usb

305
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,898
had a fucking season passages land and

306
00:10:18,898 --> 00:10:20,040
they'd be going all the time on

307
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,060
their days you know when they have

308
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:22,710
work anything just a whole erp confused

309
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:24,090
but it was all the time

310
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:25,440
all the time then i was like

311
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:26,520
oh i guess someone goes a distant

312
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,750
well it's right there so i guess

313
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:29,760
everyone just go no it's it's like

314
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,530
an hour yeah but it's closer than

315
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:32,760
you've ever been if you're from chicago

316
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,630
you know it's like wow this is

317
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:35,970
amazing so i got my season pass

318
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:37,980
and i would go quite often i

319
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,540
went a few times a year off

320
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:42,330
quite often oh but it's so fun

321
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:43,710
to have it near right so close

322
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:44,820
by i bet a half

323
00:10:44,854 --> 00:10:46,290
full of times over the years ah

324
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,990
the the thing about disneyland that i

325
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:50,850
always have this moment anytime i've been

326
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:53,790
where it's like you see the the

327
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,650
magic and innovation of it especially if

328
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:56,880
you go to like an older thing

329
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:57,180
yeah

330
00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:01,320
but you also see like the the

331
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:04,410
like the money behind it like the

332
00:11:04,417 --> 00:11:06,629
the the the thirst for money all

333
00:11:06,629 --> 00:11:08,190
the money like the cynicism of it

334
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:10,680
as an adult yeah yeah it's wild

335
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,090
it's because they both exist at the

336
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:14,340
same time yeah they they like that

337
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,870
thing with the birds from around the

338
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:17,610
world whatever that the tea room the

339
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:20,550
tiki room it's like you see the

340
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:22,452
nineteen fifties magic

341
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,240
of it of like or sixty s

342
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,390
whenever we made like that that they

343
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,620
had an idea of like we're gonna

344
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:31,110
make these things um that nobody's ever

345
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:32,820
seen before it's going to be charming

346
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:34,800
and blah blah blah blah blah it's

347
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,750
gonna make a shit ton of money

348
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:39,450
exactly yeah yeah yeah but like there's

349
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:41,550
a there's a the method to it

350
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:42,660
of it has to be

351
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:45,360
be that you it has to be

352
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,770
that you don't see the cynicism of

353
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:48,240
it yeah it has to be like

354
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:50,160
people have to be charmed by it

355
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:52,560
kids have to have like wonder in

356
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,180
their eyes when they gaze upon these

357
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:56,580
things but also we're gonna be fucking

358
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:58,920
rich yeah it's really it's a lot

359
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,810
of art and yeah exactly it's weird

360
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:02,550
like movies it's weird how they exist

361
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:02,820
side

362
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:04,650
by side yeah you know it all

363
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:06,030
wrapped up in the same thing but

364
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:07,710
i mean it doesn't it doesn't mean

365
00:12:07,710 --> 00:12:09,300
that it's not special i do like

366
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,160
the fact that disney keeps things like

367
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,230
the tiki room and the old stuff

368
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:16,110
that they could easily yeah pave over

369
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:18,570
and shoot something yo in i mean

370

371
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:22,770
adventures of and in inner space where

372
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:22,980
i teach

373
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:25,020
touched my first boob that's a good

374
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:25,890
example

375
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:28,470
right after you say excuse me ma'am

376
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,350

ah but after that it's gone now

378
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,660
it's ah i think it's a sartorial

379
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:41,430
like permanently gone yeah it start tours

380
00:12:41,696 --> 00:12:43,110
but they could swap things in and

381
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:46,320
out like they put them like because

382
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,090
i think when i saw the tiki

383
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:50,940
room it was like reopened or some

384
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:52,230
well they definitely update

385
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:53,730
things sometimes are like give it a

386
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:55,380
facelift or whatever but they but the

387
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:56,670
tiki room is a good example of

388
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:59,790
something that's like charming from nineteen fifty

389
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:03,330
five but to modern audiences like if

390
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:04,620
if you don't just buy into the

391
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:06,660
charm oh it's a transgenic it's very

392
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,040

world is a great example it's huge

398
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,240

399
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,550
estate and it's so boring yeah and

400
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:23,520

749
00:25:19,215 --> 00:25:22,335
did alone well a few days i

750
00:25:22,335 --> 00:25:24,045
was really sick during it um that

751
00:25:24,045 --> 00:25:25,485
was the time where my boyfriend at

752
00:25:25,485 --> 00:25:27,555
the time was growing the second city

753
00:25:27,555 --> 00:25:29,955
and on the cruise and so i

754
00:25:29,955 --> 00:25:33,045
went to visit and anyone like improv

755
00:25:33,195 --> 00:25:33,735
on a cruise

756
00:25:33,765 --> 00:25:36,135
i think they really did but um

757
00:25:36,255 --> 00:25:39,465
the the is really cool bug has

758
00:25:39,497 --> 00:25:40,935
had to stay in rooms that had

759
00:25:40,935 --> 00:25:43,215
no window if i recall correctly songs

760
00:25:43,215 --> 00:25:45,135
yeah so it was like kind of

761
00:25:45,135 --> 00:25:46,245
throws you off to a little bit

762
00:25:46,245 --> 00:25:47,925
i think yeah because you are staring

763
00:25:48,075 --> 00:25:50,025
down in the bilge yeah because you

764
00:25:50,256 --> 00:25:53,895
you you get seasick or or carso

765
00:25:53,895 --> 00:25:56,325
like when your eyes are not able

766
00:25:56,325 --> 00:25:59,745
to see to wear movies yes so

767
00:25:59,745 --> 00:26:01,335
i felt really horrible for a lot

768
00:26:01,335 --> 00:26:02,715
of that and then i remember watching

769
00:26:02,715 --> 00:26:04,065
the show and then getting up afterwards

770
00:26:04,065 --> 00:26:05,835
and like everyone was like falling over

771
00:26:05,895 --> 00:26:07,845
walking up the stairs because there started

772
00:26:07,845 --> 00:26:08,895
to be like a very rocky thing

773
00:26:08,895 --> 00:26:10,335
during the show and the cast was

774
00:26:10,335 --> 00:26:12,465
like sliding around and then we all

775
00:26:12,465 --> 00:26:13,515
stood up at the end and everyone

776
00:26:13,515 --> 00:26:14,055
was like look

777
00:26:14,205 --> 00:26:15,555
like falling over because it had no

778
00:26:15,585 --> 00:26:17,205

00:26:18,675 --> 00:26:20,311
the alaska ones are nice i mean

781
00:26:20,311 --> 00:26:21,885
i think it's cool to see multiple

782
00:26:21,885 --> 00:26:23,505
things but i just think i don't

783
00:26:23,505 --> 00:26:25,065
really want to be on oh you

784
00:26:25,065 --> 00:26:26,535

786
00:26:28,875 --> 00:26:31,515

00:26:32,895 --> 00:26:34,035
get out at different islands for like

789
00:26:34,065 --> 00:26:35,175
a day and get to walk around

790
00:26:35,175 --> 00:26:37,125
lake i'd rather just stay on one

791
00:26:37,125 --> 00:26:39,645
island and enjoy myself than like go

792
00:26:39,645 --> 00:26:41,235
around they're all similar when you're only

793
00:26:41,235 --> 00:26:42,435
seeing them for a moment and you

794
00:26:42,735 --> 00:26:44,175
you basically get off and yeah you

795
00:26:44,175 --> 00:26:46,095
could like get a sense of yeah

796
00:26:46,305 --> 00:26:46,695
yeah i do

797
00:26:46,695 --> 00:26:48,045
don't think i would like like the

798
00:26:48,285 --> 00:26:50,172
puerto rico cruises or whatever like yeah

799
00:26:50,172 --> 00:26:52,040
i stayed on the boat yeah where

800
00:26:52,065 --> 00:26:53,895
was in the boat it was to

801
00:26:53,895 --> 00:26:55,485
the caribbean both times and you didn't

802
00:26:55,485 --> 00:26:56,505
get to do three times and i

803
00:26:56,505 --> 00:26:57,915
didn't get off well because i figured

804
00:26:58,395 --> 00:27:00,285
because for that reason i was like

805
00:27:00,315 --> 00:27:02,115
i would rather just go there once

806
00:27:02,115 --> 00:27:03,485
to go see like in some times

807
00:27:03,485 --> 00:27:05,445
someone selling you t-shirts and stuff on

808
00:27:05,445 --> 00:27:06,855
a dock essentially that's it

809
00:27:06,855 --> 00:27:07,815
it yeah i mean that's what i

810
00:27:07,815 --> 00:27:08,925
wanna see should i have gotten off

811
00:27:09,165 --> 00:27:09,495
oh shit

812
00:27:10,725 --> 00:27:11,865
at that point i did want to

813
00:27:11,865 --> 00:27:13,483
see that because i didn't like being

814
00:27:13,483 --> 00:27:15,945
on the boat but yeah um because

815
00:27:15,945 --> 00:27:17,385
it doesn't ruin your sea legs when

816
00:27:17,385 --> 00:27:19,185
you get back on probably it probably

817
00:27:19,185 --> 00:27:20,475
made it worse i don't know i

818
00:27:20,475 --> 00:27:22,755
don't remember but yeah i i don't

819
00:27:22,815 --> 00:27:23,895

00:30:42,475 --> 00:30:44,335
like i've i've tried to say it

923
00:30:44,335 --> 00:30:46,075
on this podcast before i'm sure i

924
00:30:46,087 --> 00:30:47,755
brought up eating couch but i don't

925
00:30:47,755 --> 00:30:49,135
think i mentioned i feel we've talked

926
00:30:49,135 --> 00:30:51,295
about that stranger my strange addiction i'm

927
00:30:51,295 --> 00:30:51,445
sure

928
00:30:51,535 --> 00:30:52,586
well we've talked about it for sure

929
00:30:52,586 --> 00:30:53,365
but i don't know if we talked

930
00:30:53,365 --> 00:30:54,955
about the more recent episodes okay so

931
00:30:54,955 --> 00:30:56,215
what's going on know that there's some

932
00:30:56,215 --> 00:30:57,385
saying that coffee enemas and the cat

933
00:30:57,385 --> 00:30:59,305
hair so what is what does a

934
00:30:59,305 --> 00:31:02,485
coffee enema ah they put coffee up

935
00:31:02,485 --> 00:31:05,695
their anus and then um it makes

936
00:31:05,695 --> 00:31:07,885
them awake all day or assumption doesn't

937
00:31:07,885 --> 00:31:09,355
coffee come out the anus or come

938
00:31:09,355 --> 00:31:10,975
out yeah i think it comes out

939
00:31:10,975 --> 00:31:11,605
like soon

940
00:31:11,605 --> 00:31:13,735
now coffee fountain say they have to

941
00:31:13,735 --> 00:31:14,905
be close to the bathroom all day

942
00:31:14,905 --> 00:31:16,105
which is another reason why they want

943
00:31:16,118 --> 00:31:16,825
to work from home so they could

944
00:31:16,827 --> 00:31:19,375
have these animals and then do this

945
00:31:19,375 --> 00:31:20,995
in the name that's the couple had

946
00:31:20,995 --> 00:31:22,195
created this ritual together

947
00:31:23,395 --> 00:31:24,715
that's fun that there they do it

948
00:31:24,715 --> 00:31:26,455
together yeah i think that makes it

949
00:31:26,455 --> 00:31:27,895
really romantic and cute and it's like

950
00:31:27,895 --> 00:31:29,305
not a problem it also makes it

951
00:31:29,305 --> 00:31:30,895
more of a sustainable addiction if somebody

952
00:31:30,895 --> 00:31:32,005
else is doing right there with you

953
00:31:32,335 --> 00:31:33,805
that's true about addiction in general i

954
00:31:33,895 --> 00:31:36,535
is to show intervention stolen i don't

955
00:31:36,535 --> 00:31:37,825
know if that is that show is

956
00:31:37,825 --> 00:31:39,505
so dark it was i got into

957
00:31:39,505 --> 00:31:41,425
watching it for i would say like

958
00:31:41,425 --> 00:31:43,195
a month or two and then i

959
00:31:43,195 --> 00:31:43,525
just couldn't

960
00:31:43,525 --> 00:31:44,635
i'll take it anymore that's how i've

961
00:31:44,635 --> 00:31:46,075
been with hoarders like sometimes i just

962
00:31:46,075 --> 00:31:48,445
kill the one i remember the most

963
00:31:48,445 --> 00:31:49,795
though was there was a guy young

964
00:31:49,795 --> 00:31:52,405
man who was addicted to video segments

965
00:31:53,425 --> 00:31:57,078
you do you're addicted video games yeah

966
00:31:57,085 --> 00:31:57,325
right

967
00:31:58,915 --> 00:32:01,405
it's become a real shame um are

968
00:32:01,405 --> 00:32:03,505
we playing less he was later he

969
00:32:03,505 --> 00:32:05,125
was he so he's playing video games

970
00:32:05,125 --> 00:32:06,685
all the time and it was impacting

971
00:32:06,685 --> 00:32:07,975
his life and impacting he had a

972
00:32:07,975 --> 00:32:10,375
relationship he had a girlfriend and so

973
00:32:10,375 --> 00:32:11,815
when they get to the intervention part

974
00:32:12,145 --> 00:32:15,265
well of course but when it got

975
00:32:15,265 --> 00:32:17,455
to the intervention part the intervention was

976
00:32:17,455 --> 00:32:18,355
so short

977
00:32:18,745 --> 00:32:22,135
because the girlfriend was like if you

978
00:32:22,135 --> 00:32:24,085
don't stop doing this i'm gonna have

979
00:32:24,085 --> 00:32:26,725
to leave you is like stop any

980
00:32:27,925 --> 00:32:29,485
well like that stuff the same as

981
00:32:29,485 --> 00:32:31,945
other types of dough but it was

982
00:32:31,945 --> 00:32:33,565
like well so of course most of

983
00:32:33,565 --> 00:32:35,425
the show is the addiction and you

984
00:32:35,425 --> 00:32:36,895
see the person doing it and you

985
00:32:36,895 --> 00:32:38,995
talk to the people that it's affecting

986
00:32:39,175 --> 00:32:40,975
you know and all that shit mean

987
00:32:40,975 --> 00:32:42,355
i always remember as the one woman

988
00:32:42,355 --> 00:32:44,425
who sucked canned air

989
00:32:45,475 --> 00:32:48,175
oh you know what yeah let's spray

990
00:32:48,205 --> 00:32:51,196
air yes so spray dust is is

991
00:32:51,205 --> 00:32:52,975
an intervention part of my strange addiction

992
00:32:53,095 --> 00:32:54,835
or no no this was an intervention

993
00:32:54,925 --> 00:32:57,115
okay and she would suck that it's

994
00:32:57,115 --> 00:32:58,765
basically get really high and talk really

995
00:32:58,765 --> 00:33:00,976
slow and then oh wait wait she's

996
00:33:00,976 --> 00:33:03,145
sucking the nitrous whatever it comes in

997
00:33:03,145 --> 00:33:05,245
those dust spray cans she's just so

998
00:33:05,245 --> 00:33:05,485
easy

999
00:33:05,635 --> 00:33:07,735
president nitrates well there must be something

1000
00:33:07,735 --> 00:33:09,265
in it because you know like whip

1001
00:33:09,265 --> 00:33:12,715
its winces or major slows the brain

1002
00:33:12,775 --> 00:33:14,457
or something i don't know write whatever

1003
00:33:14,457 --> 00:33:15,865
it was she'd be like if there

1004
00:33:15,865 --> 00:33:17,365
was a whole compilation on youtube of

1005
00:33:17,365 --> 00:33:20,335
her going like um walk god said

1006
00:33:20,335 --> 00:33:22,585
shy and yes she's do it yeah

1007
00:33:22,615 --> 00:33:24,775
she's not just not doing literally air

1008
00:33:24,775 --> 00:33:25,765
she's doing yeah so

1009
00:33:25,765 --> 00:33:27,355
nothing in the stuff that's in there

1010
00:33:27,385 --> 00:33:29,454
that makes it come out yeah yeah

1011
00:33:29,515 --> 00:33:30,955

the thing that really bummed me out

1016
00:33:38,785 --> 00:33:40,345
was that at the end they would

1017
00:33:40,495 --> 00:33:41,485

1090
00:36:12,085 --> 00:36:14,995
new jersey will say that um one

1091
00:36:14,995 --> 00:36:15,925
of my oldest friends

1092
00:36:17,305 --> 00:36:20,335
he when he was growing up there

1093
00:36:20,335 --> 00:36:23,545
was this funeral home in his where

1094
00:36:23,545 --> 00:36:24,265
he lived

1095
00:36:26,125 --> 00:36:27,715
called the house of gayer

1096

g a y e yes and so

1097

1098
00:36:32,875 --> 00:36:34,765
people mistake it for something else or

1099
00:36:35,725 --> 00:36:36,682
like they go in and go oh

1100
00:36:36,682 --> 00:36:39,895

00:36:39,895 --> 00:36:41,665
the last name of the people yeah

1102
00:36:41,665 --> 00:36:44,005

1103
00:36:44,005 --> 00:36:46,525
was a kid his a friend of

1104
00:36:46,525 --> 00:36:48,475
his i think started this i think

1105
00:36:48,475 --> 00:36:49,015
it was in the friends

1106
00:36:49,075 --> 00:36:50,935
neighborhood houses gayer because buddy and i

1107
00:36:50,935 --> 00:36:51,925
grew up not that far from each

1108
00:36:51,925 --> 00:36:54,741
other um and so they there was

1109
00:36:54,745 --> 00:36:56,725
a thing where they would like say

1110
00:36:57,505 --> 00:36:58,465
like when they were kids this is

1111
00:36:58,465 --> 00:36:59,815
when they were children of course

1112
00:37:01,165 --> 00:37:03,985
gay gay house of gayer going gay

1113
00:37:04,045 --> 00:37:04,945
come out gay here

1114
00:37:07,975 --> 00:37:09,565
i don't know how this evolved

1115
00:37:10,825 --> 00:37:12,025
but it got to be that

1116
00:37:13,165 --> 00:37:16,405
if you started saying it the other

1117
00:37:16,405 --> 00:37:20,065
person's challenge was to say say gayer

1118
00:37:20,335 --> 00:37:22,045
before you got to the end of

1119
00:37:22,045 --> 00:37:23,845
the front ah it's a pretty fun

1120
00:37:23,845 --> 00:37:25,105
one so like gay gay hell so

1121
00:37:25,105 --> 00:37:27,955

1122
00:37:27,955 --> 00:37:30,985
then we started doing it as adults

1123
00:37:31,045 --> 00:37:32,845
like he told us this right and

1124
00:37:32,845 --> 00:37:33,205

00:49:16,020 --> 00:49:17,910
means a game and speaking of games

1502
00:49:18,540 --> 00:49:20,680
i have to say this yeah and

1503
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:22,170
it it breaks my heart to say

1504
00:49:22,170 --> 00:49:23,760
this oh no

1505
00:49:26,310 --> 00:49:30,180
as we all know wordle was purchased

1506
00:49:30,180 --> 00:49:31,980
by the new york times the paper

1507
00:49:31,980 --> 00:49:33,930
of record yes the old gray lady

1508
00:49:34,710 --> 00:49:36,600
the the creator of wardle josh wardle

1509
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:38,520
got millions of dollars good for him

1510
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:39,750
and we know we know it's at

1511
00:49:39,750 --> 00:49:40,890
least one million

1512
00:49:42,030 --> 00:49:43,560
so a million and one dollars we

1513
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:46,050
know it's seven figures so so good

1514
00:49:46,050 --> 00:49:47,580
for him it could be nine million

1515
00:49:47,580 --> 00:49:48,930
we don't even know i think it's

1516
00:49:48,930 --> 00:49:50,760
nine point nine million dollars and good

1517
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:52,530
for him and they just didn't want

1518
00:49:52,530 --> 00:49:55,020
to say they're giving figures good for

1519
00:49:55,020 --> 00:49:57,030
him and his labour and created for

1520
00:49:57,210 --> 00:49:57,780
but

1521
00:49:59,250 --> 00:50:00,180
we have learned

1522
00:50:01,620 --> 00:50:04,140
that we are no longer all having

1523
00:50:04,140 --> 00:50:07,740
the same shared experience just shoot the

1524
00:50:07,740 --> 00:50:10,260
word is i feel like a mike's

1525
00:50:10,260 --> 00:50:13,080
word is different today okay we're gonna

1526
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:14,970
need to investigate ah yes yeah but

1527
00:50:14,970 --> 00:50:16,050
there was a story about it because

1528
00:50:16,260 --> 00:50:18,390
shane my sandro the word yeah he's

1529
00:50:18,394 --> 00:50:20,130
in the world because the original world

1530
00:50:20,130 --> 00:50:21,360
is a day ahead or something

1531
00:50:22,030 --> 00:50:23,590
something like that something like that by

1532
00:50:23,590 --> 00:50:24,760
the way there we haven't even talked

1533
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:26,410
about wordle on this show but no

1534
00:50:26,410 --> 00:50:28,570
we have at some point i know

1535
00:50:28,570 --> 00:50:30,130
world people are sick of hearing about

1536
00:50:30,130 --> 00:50:33,220
wordle but at some point lauren learned

1537
00:50:33,220 --> 00:50:34,900
about wordle i've been playing for two

1538
00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:36,280
days i think at that point we

1539
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:37,270
had tried to keep it from her

1540
00:50:38,380 --> 00:50:39,760
lauren learned about words that she was

1541
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:41,650
too young and she she got very

1542
00:50:41,650 --> 00:50:43,780
excited and she texted a sol and

1543
00:50:43,780 --> 00:50:46,390
said we all have to start playing

1544
00:50:46,390 --> 00:50:48,280
word author every day i'd send each

1545
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:49,510
other each other yeah let's compete with

1546
00:50:49,510 --> 00:50:50,950
each other and i was like i

1547
00:50:50,950 --> 00:50:52,180
thought it was so wholesome and i

1548
00:50:52,180 --> 00:50:54,760
was like lauren good for you too

1549
00:50:54,790 --> 00:50:56,260
for finding some way to keep us

1550
00:50:56,260 --> 00:50:58,480
connected during the pandemics and

1551
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:00,070
and and i was like you know

1552
00:51:00,070 --> 00:51:00,940

00:51:02,860 --> 00:51:04,990
like a month ago but i was

1554
00:51:04,990 --> 00:51:05,410

1559
00:51:12,460 --> 00:51:14,320

1578
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:48,430
new york times took it over but

1579
00:51:48,430 --> 00:51:51,730

that sucks but the the fact that

1585
00:52:03,070 --> 00:52:06,460
we're not not everybody isn't doing is

1586
00:52:06,460 --> 00:52:07,120
having the same

1587
00:52:07,150 --> 00:52:09,610

1588
00:52:09,610 --> 00:52:11,020
fun out of whoa what on earth

00:52:14,950 --> 00:52:16,510
of the fucking game is i don't

1592
00:52:16,510 --> 00:52:18,250

1593
00:52:18,250 --> 00:52:20,110
on twitter yeah because people know what

yeah that yeah i don't know how

1595
00:52:21,700 --> 00:52:22,930
there are two versions of it that

1596
00:52:22,930 --> 00:52:24,460
doesn't make any sense to me let's

1597
00:52:24,460 --> 00:52:26,740

1601
00:52:30,550 --> 00:52:33,160
time no it's a brain fart somebody

1602
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:35,320
pushing somebody plays quarrel that i know

1603
00:52:35,350 --> 00:52:36,820

1604
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:38,830
this come on i know let's talk

1605
00:52:38,830 --> 00:52:40,210
about today's word because i've worried that

1606
00:52:40,210 --> 00:52:42,100
mike is playing the different one okay

1607
00:52:42,130 --> 00:52:43,990
let's see what that word here is

1608
00:52:43,990 --> 00:52:46,280
cock okay that's what i had oh

1609
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:47,440
hey now now

1610
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:52,450
now he played he got the c

1611
00:52:52,450 --> 00:52:54,640
right he got the k right and

1612
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:56,440
then he got then he gets something

1613
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:58,570
on the middle one i may ask

1614
00:52:58,570 --> 00:53:00,010
him to send me his what's his

1615
00:53:00,100 --> 00:53:01,810
first yes send the screenshot because i

1616
00:53:01,810 --> 00:53:02,890
was trying to figure out what because

1617
00:53:02,890 --> 00:53:04,090
sometimes i'll look at you guys as

1618
00:53:04,092 --> 00:53:05,770
words and i'll try to figure out

1619
00:53:05,770 --> 00:53:07,570
what yeah words you guess i

1620
00:53:07,645 --> 00:53:08,830
i think that will be a fun

1621
00:53:08,830 --> 00:53:10,960
way to keep us connected to is

1622
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:13,150
like what if we guessed everyone's previous

1623
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:16,240
previously unworkable but i was trying to

1624
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:18,100
guess his first word and i find

1625
00:53:18,100 --> 00:53:19,840
out i didn't think it was possible

1626
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:20,920
because it had it can't be the

1627
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:22,750
u so it had to be an

1628
00:53:22,780 --> 00:53:24,280
l or something so i was like

1629
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:25,960
what did he guess first first word

1630
00:53:26,230 --> 00:53:27,760
and then i started worrying that he

1631
00:53:28,030 --> 00:53:29,500
and his second word i started worrying

1632
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:31,810
that he had a different rudeness yeah

1633
00:53:31,810 --> 00:53:33,070
that's gonna freak me out because we'll

1634
00:53:33,070 --> 00:53:34,870
see if he writes me sick with

1635
00:53:34,870 --> 00:53:36,820
worry it's gonna free i was so

1636
00:53:36,850 --> 00:53:38,470
i've just been sitting here the entire

1637
00:53:38,470 --> 00:53:40,120
time we've been recording saying i hope

1638
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:41,410

1639
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:43,930
