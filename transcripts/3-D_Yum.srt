68
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,240
saying it's a bad

69
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,590
good show i had our time was

70
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:58,590
like the ritual humiliation of the character

71
00:02:58,620 --> 00:02:59,790
yeah because you feel that in your

72
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:00,360
own life

73
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,570
i watch tv to escape well i

74
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:05,400
mean in a way yeah it's like

75
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:08,250
it's not it's not there's another showing

76
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,570
i go to escape rooms to just

77
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:11,130
sit there and so they kicked me

78
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:13,770
out the scenes the scenes in love

79
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:16,140
where where paul rust is at work

80
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,300
get away sin it this is the

81
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,740
scenes in love with paul ross does

82
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:21,600
it work and everyone is just so

83
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,510
so horrible to him yeah i found

84
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:26,160
that those scenes really bummed me out

85
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,840
because it's like i don't like it

86
00:03:27,843 --> 00:03:30,030
because it replicates our relationship and when

87
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:32,250
he was working on the show because

88
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,230
he based all those on on my

89
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:37,650
relationship we have i just did an

90
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:39,720
interview where i had to talk about

91
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,730
something more lauren talk about everything

92
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:42,576
but

93
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:45,450
i just think that west conference under

94
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:48,030
rated and lord was under-rated and you

95
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:49,620
said something about waiting to see the

96
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:50,550
come back but i felt that it's

97
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:51,900
not under-rated i feel like a lot

98
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,790
people it's appropriate your show did okay

99
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:56,010
yes i'm saying so then i decided

100
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:57,540
to talk about episodes have you seen

101
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:59,820
episodes and yes yeah jamie loves it

102
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,650
oh yeah jamie's is a huge episodes

103
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:03,090
fan yeah i love that lol i

104
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:03,810
just wanted to say i will

105
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,670
say the comeback new episodes are two

106
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:08,010
of the only shows that like it

107
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:10,500
can be taken very literal their titles

108
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,660
you know like episodes there literally are

109
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:14,340
episodes of them and to come back

110
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,900
was off for many years and then

111
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:18,450
came back there's no title more literal

112
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:20,370
than sixty minutes that's very true one

113
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:21,510
hundred and twenty minutes maybe

114
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:26,160
with matt pinwheel oh wow don't you

115
00:04:26,163 --> 00:04:27,840
think it's very derivative of sixty minutes

116
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,480
yeah maybe what about the news

117
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,770
news news welcome to the new

118
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,340
what if someone copyrighted that title the

119
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:40,710
news in a good mood everyone just

120
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:43,650

123
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,770
inside knowing they know pant to be

124
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:52,410

was not concerned with subjectivities at the

188
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:56,310
time and you're speaking like a police

189
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:58,380
officer has to deescalate the situation

190
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,570
i do not wish to style my

191
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:01,080
hair in that manner

192
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:05,910
ah so the perpetrator and so i

193
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:07,500
simply walked away and didn't do anything

194
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,420
to it what's the what's the worst

195
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:11,788
haircut you've had that's probably got oh

196
00:07:11,788 --> 00:07:12,930
but you know what a few years

197
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:14,280
ago i had one that i hated

198
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:18,330
it was like two thousand ah twelve

199
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,100
or something i cut my hair above

200
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:22,320
my shoulder but it didn't

201
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,640
i mean your over the shoulder boulder

202
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,800
holder sadly but to me it was

203
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,530
just a horrible length because i just

204
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:29,880
think i either need to have longer

205
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,423
hair or short about i don't know

206
00:07:31,423 --> 00:07:32,670
i i'm too afraid to go short

207
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:34,110
anymore but i think it was i

208
00:07:34,110 --> 00:07:36,870
think above my shoulders is dangerous because

209
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:38,520
it's like it kind of like falls

210
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,570
in this weird way i hated it

211
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:40,770
so much that i would straighten it

212
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:42,210
every day because i thought it looked

213
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:42,480
so

214
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,910
so stupid and then that i hated

215
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:46,290
to i just hated i'd said wait

216
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:47,100
for it to grow out but it

217
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:47,970
was like i wanted to take a

218
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:48,960
risk but i didn't make a big

219
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,220
enough one for to do anything he

220
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:53,700
just became like an annoying thing yeah

221
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,590
i remember when i was eighteen my

222
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:57,660
friend cut hair my best friend at

223
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:59,340
the time and he and i i

224
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:02,070
think i'd had a very similar well

225
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:02,640
i did

226
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,870
i cut my hair like anthony michael

227
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:06,210
hall in weird science when i was

228
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:08,220
sixteen or seventeen so i kind of

229
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:10,380
like like joe kind of why you

230
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:12,480
instructed the person to do so well

231
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,070
sort of i had like short on

232
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:15,510
the side and back a little bit

233
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:17,040
but it was like droopy eyed as

234
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,530
a friend i mean ah but then

235
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:22,260
but then i remember ah my friend

236
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:22,800
was like oh

237
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:24,090
let me cut your hair for you

238
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,830
because they use concern for me or

239
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:28,860
so and and he was like well

240
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:30,300
what do you want your hair to

241
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:31,590

244
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:37,860
he liked like he's like let me

00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:38,700
take a look at a picture you

246
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:39,690

250
00:08:43,003 --> 00:08:44,700

251
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:46,140
oh yeah because you weren't putting down

252
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:47,186
finance i wasn't putting stuff in it

253
00:08:47,186 --> 00:08:48,720
so he's like let me just give

00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,340
you a short on the sides and

255
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:53,610
back and and you know slightly longer

256
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:54,990
on top cut and then we'll put

257
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:56,550
it up and you'll see what this

258
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,020
and i did it and it would

259
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:59,580
look great and was like oh you

260
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:02,100

261
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,060
like well

262
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:04,590
that's interesting because i felt like it

263
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:06,540
was like a california temperature to no

264
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:08,310
stop de-escalating the city with

265
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:11,250
that's the sign i think like nobody

266
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:12,480
else i grew up with put shit

267
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,130
in their hair like no dude really

268
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,450
did that it was like maybe it's

269
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:17,250
very midwest to not do that but

270
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:19,860
like there was with those like tuna

271
00:09:19,864 --> 00:09:22,110
transsexual or something or just no one

272
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:24,240
cares like yeah there was like we're

273
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,250
from chicago we all got a winter

274
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:27,900
hat don't give a fuck but like

275
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,520
there was a point from chicago

276
00:09:29,565 --> 00:09:32,070
we all look dumb i just impressed

277
00:09:32,082 --> 00:09:33,660
but the only time people did it

278
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:35,250
was when it was really popular to

279
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:36,750
do like that little flip in the

280
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:39,390
front it was like just a triangle

281
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:40,860
yeah and um then people would be

282
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:42,299
putting their gel in and it's like

283
00:09:42,299 --> 00:09:44,880
straight out jimmy jimmy whom i think

284
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,740
a cartoon character neutron oh i thought

285
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:48,090
even you have martin short when he

286
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:49,140

00:09:49,802 --> 00:09:51,810
yeah yeah yeah who dressed up as

288
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:53,820

always been very fond of march shorn

293
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,960
so sctv was like a huge thing

294
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:05,481
i would pick out in every interview

295
00:10:05,558 --> 00:10:07,230
they'd say who's your dream guest like

296
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:09,330
that's that's the one question interview it

297
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:09,570
ah

298
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:12,570

300
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:16,860
simon we know many did it to

301
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:18,030

302
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:18,750
movie theater

303
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:21,330

00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:29,790
that lasted for a complete year because

306
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:30,900
i kept a did it for a

307
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,520
year i kept trying to correct it

308
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:35,970
and i went to different places three

309
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:37,950
different places that all ignored what i

310
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:39,750
told them to do and they did

311
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:40,020
the same

312
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:41,820
same thing that the original person did

313
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,170
so they're working off the blueprint they're

314
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:44,190
like this guy doesn't know you so

315
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:45,150
yeah i'll just give me the same

316
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:47,250
thing yes it happened but it happened

317
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:50,160
on the sarah silverman program where i

318
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,770
was i played a cop sometimes and

319
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,160
this one hair person for whatever reason

320
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,930
was like yeah cops don't have hair

321
00:10:57,930 --> 00:10:59,580
like that and then like cut my

322
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:00,120

323
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:02,220

messing with your looks yeah but also

325
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:06,331
for this thing like i'm here for

326
00:11:06,331 --> 00:11:08,160
a fucking day said that one at

327
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,350
that this show isn't like you know

328
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,030
it's not a drama right what are

329
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:13,860
you doing anything my hair was a

330
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:15,810
problem on both episodes i did to

331
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:17,160
the point where like people were mad

332
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,440
at me or you you looked insane

333
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,100

time they dyed my hair jet black

336
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:27,690
because sara felt like the character would

337
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:30,480
have black hair that's very stupid and

338
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,160
so they dyed my hair jumps back

339
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,540
and was like alright because i was

340
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:35,040
a cop or i was a i

341
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,480
was like an fbi detect and they

342
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,190
died died they died they died at

343
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:40,260
once brown and she's like why what

344
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:40,440
did you

345
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,210
came in and slapped dark enough and

346
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:45,210
they died it again jet black and

347
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:46,650
then the second time they were human

348
00:11:46,685 --> 00:11:48,000
like they didn't put an wash out

349
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,590
color they don't die they died it

350
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:51,660
that is so weird and then the

351
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:54,000
second time i came in they they

352
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,160
just cast me and they said um

353
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:58,830
you you're playing someone who's mistaken for

354
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:00,660
jay and i said ok but i've

355
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:03,270
really short hair right now and i

356
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:04,620
think rob said oh yeah it's totally

357
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:05,820
fine he came and took a look

358
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:06,870
it was like yeah we can fix

359
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:08,580
it and then sarah like flipped out

360
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:10,170
and was like why are we casting

361
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:11,340
and he doesn't have hair like j

362
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:12,540
anymore and so they put on like

363
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:13,380
a wig or something

364
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:16,410
but then weren't you on again with

super short blonde hair as a cop

366
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:21,570
now that was clear enthusiasm oh that

367
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:22,830

00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:25,410

a lot of girls that i just

didn't become friends with but i think

788
00:26:50,145 --> 00:26:52,155
it was partly because i was in

789
00:26:52,155 --> 00:26:53,955
my own world with my improv stuff

790
00:26:53,955 --> 00:26:55,095

00:26:55,155 --> 00:26:56,445
friends at school i only had a

792
00:26:56,445 --> 00:26:58,755
couple of friends at school around here

793
00:26:58,755 --> 00:27:00,045
it was because i lived in sort

that's not fair to say you say

857
00:29:28,155 --> 00:29:29,355
you wanted to be spared

858
00:29:30,795 --> 00:29:32,415

862
00:29:39,495 --> 00:29:41,055
trying to get in there to explain

863
00:29:41,085 --> 00:29:42,525
no i'm saying that you're like the

864
00:29:42,555 --> 00:29:44,145
person who wants to explain and wants

865
00:29:44,145 --> 00:29:46,515
justice oh damn it all comes back

866
00:29:46,545 --> 00:29:47,955
up it all comes back to that

867
00:29:47,955 --> 00:29:50,415
one element from your childhood so fascinating

868
00:29:50,775 --> 00:29:53,025
well yeah that was like proust's madeleine

869
00:29:54,675 --> 00:29:58,335
um ah the what about the proposal

870
00:29:58,335 --> 00:29:59,685
though my dear since you've already been

871
00:29:59,685 --> 00:30:01,275
saying and already been sparing you should

872
00:30:01,275 --> 00:30:02,625
bring up anything you um ah

873
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:05,265
i just wanted to say that i

874
00:30:05,265 --> 00:30:07,245
think that people you know when you're

875
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:09,075
on a dating show like that you're

876
00:30:09,075 --> 00:30:10,845
kind of hoping that there's a general

877
00:30:10,845 --> 00:30:12,705
look about the person right and i

878
00:30:12,705 --> 00:30:15,375
think there is a safety sort of

879
00:30:15,465 --> 00:30:18,495
ah default setting of human well i

880
00:30:18,495 --> 00:30:21,045
guess i guess people tend to say

881
00:30:21,045 --> 00:30:23,205
they like but they don't even know

882
00:30:23,235 --> 00:30:23,685
really

883
00:30:24,471 --> 00:30:25,935
i would think that anything that pops

884
00:30:25,935 --> 00:30:28,215
up you'd be like oh wow that's

885
00:30:28,275 --> 00:30:29,325
my feeling is if you're on a

886
00:30:29,325 --> 00:30:30,885
show where you want to marry someone

887
00:30:30,885 --> 00:30:34,095
within either three minutes or seven weeks

888
00:30:34,095 --> 00:30:36,285
seven weeks you can't be that picky

889
00:30:36,285 --> 00:30:37,935
about who the fuck is right because

890
00:30:37,935 --> 00:30:40,245
you are desperate oh yeah that's insane

891
00:30:40,275 --> 00:30:41,655
yeah like if you're agreeing to do

892
00:30:41,655 --> 00:30:42,945
that in the first place that's just

893
00:30:43,035 --> 00:30:44,535
nuts nuts and then the

894
00:30:44,625 --> 00:30:48,375
people on these shows i just feel

895
00:30:48,735 --> 00:30:52,245
so bad thinking that they're these moments

896
00:30:52,245 --> 00:30:53,775
especially in the proposal because it's even

897
00:30:53,955 --> 00:30:55,965
less time in the bachelor where they're

898
00:30:55,965 --> 00:30:57,645
just standing there going like you're the

899
00:30:57,645 --> 00:30:58,905
kind of person i'm looking for it

900
00:30:58,905 --> 00:31:01,155
they've asked them like three questions maybe

901
00:31:01,365 --> 00:31:02,535
and they don't know anything about them

902
00:31:02,535 --> 00:31:04,065
they've never heard them like talk for

903
00:31:04,695 --> 00:31:06,405
inherited period of time they've never had

904
00:31:06,405 --> 00:31:08,322
a great conversation like like this yeah

905
00:31:08,325 --> 00:31:09,825
and like where it's just fire in

906
00:31:09,825 --> 00:31:11,235
the room and everyone can feel it

907
00:31:11,265 --> 00:31:13,485
yeah it's just the electricity but like

908
00:31:13,755 --> 00:31:15,255
they're just going like i always wanted

909
00:31:15,255 --> 00:31:17,145
someone like you wanna live like i'm

910
00:31:17,145 --> 00:31:18,423
so excited to be with you and

911
00:31:18,465 --> 00:31:20,715
like you don't know yeah what is

912
00:31:20,715 --> 00:31:23,085
happening in your life that that you

00:31:23,295 --> 00:31:24,645

00:31:24,945 --> 00:31:26,115
right now and you don't care to

916
00:31:26,115 --> 00:31:28,185
know the person how what is a

917
00:31:28,185 --> 00:31:30,465
realistic i'm not even saying like oh

they should have a timer on eat

931
00:31:58,455 --> 00:32:00,405
on the bachelor on each guy and

932
00:32:00,405 --> 00:32:01,725
then whenever he starts talking to the

they have these really twenty years probably

940
00:32:15,075 --> 00:32:17,385

00:35:31,215 --> 00:35:33,135
like no i'm there to two and

1043
00:35:33,135 --> 00:35:35,265
a half hours in the morning and

1044
00:35:35,325 --> 00:35:37,845
and before before acting school and i

1045
00:35:37,845 --> 00:35:39,795
was like dude we're an acting school

1046
00:35:40,215 --> 00:35:42,435
twelve to thirteen to fourteen hours a

1047
00:35:42,435 --> 00:35:43,935
day why

1048
00:35:44,085 --> 00:35:45,855
yeah and he's just like look at

1049
00:35:45,855 --> 00:35:47,715
me and look at you yeah exactly

1050
00:35:47,925 --> 00:35:49,605
but that's what it takes on me

1051
00:35:49,753 --> 00:35:51,525
yeah you know and it sometimes takes

1052
00:35:51,555 --> 00:35:54,585
two to the admire people who care

1053
00:35:54,645 --> 00:35:56,475
about them their bodies and wanna do

1054
00:35:56,475 --> 00:35:57,855
all these things but just so many

1055
00:35:57,855 --> 00:35:59,325
of those guys among they are not

1056
00:35:59,325 --> 00:36:00,615
more interesting than that they don't have

1057
00:36:00,615 --> 00:36:01,845
more to say than that like you

1058
00:36:01,845 --> 00:36:03,645
can tell they're the they just fight

1059
00:36:03,645 --> 00:36:04,185
with each other and

1060
00:36:04,245 --> 00:36:05,505
because here's the thing if you want

1061
00:36:05,505 --> 00:36:07,485
to see a bachelor with just you

1062
00:36:07,485 --> 00:36:09,885
know normal looking people average looking people

1063
00:36:09,915 --> 00:36:13,395
yeah but are they just the same

1064
00:36:13,455 --> 00:36:15,525
level of doneness as the people on

1065
00:36:15,525 --> 00:36:16,605
the show because i think they would

1066
00:36:16,635 --> 00:36:19,065
be more interesting nah i don't know

1067
00:36:19,065 --> 00:36:20,205
that's not to say the good looking

1068
00:36:20,205 --> 00:36:21,975
people are not as interesting no no

1069
00:36:21,975 --> 00:36:23,775
but before that i was like people

1070
00:36:23,775 --> 00:36:24,375
are inf

1071
00:36:24,375 --> 00:36:26,205
apparently more yeah well let's just say

1072
00:36:26,235 --> 00:36:27,345
a lot of people on that show

1073
00:36:27,345 --> 00:36:29,595
are average looking but they work out

1074
00:36:29,595 --> 00:36:31,395
really hard yeah that's that's what i

1075
00:36:31,395 --> 00:36:32,835
mean i would rather see i would

1076
00:36:32,835 --> 00:36:36,315
rather see just as pretty or whatever

1077
00:36:36,315 --> 00:36:38,085
people but who just don't work out

1078
00:36:38,115 --> 00:36:40,065
all the way over here obsession but

1079
00:36:40,065 --> 00:36:41,565
i think that it's like if if

1080
00:36:41,565 --> 00:36:43,155
you want good looking people who are

1081
00:36:43,185 --> 00:36:44,535
interesting those

1082
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:46,845
those people have made other chart of

1083
00:36:46,845 --> 00:36:48,885
the half-day relationship if they yeah they've

1084
00:36:48,892 --> 00:36:49,845
been able to make other choices in

1085
00:36:49,845 --> 00:36:51,255
their life that does not lead them

1086
00:36:51,255 --> 00:36:53,205
to being on these shows yeah you

1087
00:36:53,205 --> 00:36:54,945
know i guess although i i don't

1088
00:36:54,945 --> 00:36:57,465
know i think that ah is that

1089
00:36:57,465 --> 00:36:59,055
discounting people who are just like i

1090
00:36:59,055 --> 00:37:00,825
don't know i want an interesting experience

1091
00:37:00,825 --> 00:37:01,605
i don't know when i look at

1092
00:37:01,785 --> 00:37:03,945
sure there are some people like this

1093
00:37:04,035 --> 00:37:04,665
but i think

1094
00:37:04,755 --> 00:37:06,822
i want interesting experience i think i

1095
00:37:07,305 --> 00:37:08,145
want to see oh goes on the

1096
00:37:08,145 --> 00:37:09,585
bachelor that is not as good as

00:37:09,585 --> 00:37:12,075
your girls on films i just or

1098
00:37:12,165 --> 00:37:14,595

i'm sure there is good to know

1100
00:37:16,725 --> 00:37:19,185
all who are on they're just they're

1101
00:37:19,185 --> 00:37:20,625
interesting people and they are trying to

1102
00:37:20,625 --> 00:37:22,845
have an interesting time but it doesn't

1103
00:37:22,845 --> 00:37:24,855
feel like those are the people

1104
00:37:24,855 --> 00:37:27,075
will that create the content that they

1105
00:37:27,075 --> 00:37:28,695
want on the show and so we

1106
00:37:28,695 --> 00:37:29,805
don't see a lot of that we

1107
00:37:29,805 --> 00:37:31,155
see it edited down to people being

1108
00:37:31,155 --> 00:37:33,795
like dude oh well no like the

1109
00:37:33,795 --> 00:37:37,815
first season of ah of ah what's

1110
00:37:37,815 --> 00:37:40,155
the show started talking about the jefferson

1111
00:37:40,215 --> 00:37:42,795
proposed the jeffersons no thing brother big

1112
00:37:42,795 --> 00:37:45,015
brother yeah was was just nice people

1113
00:37:45,015 --> 00:37:46,155
all who are boring and they were

1114
00:37:46,155 --> 00:37:48,270
like and and america voted out the

1115
00:37:48,270 --> 00:37:50,415
the the ones who were yelling because

1116
00:37:50,415 --> 00:37:51,043
they were like i don't want to

1117
00:37:51,043 --> 00:37:52,485
see people yelling that was back when

1118
00:37:52,785 --> 00:37:54,915
america voted on a chain and so

1119
00:37:54,915 --> 00:37:56,685
they voted out the people who were

1120
00:37:56,715 --> 00:37:58,335
and and the it was from another

1121
00:37:58,335 --> 00:38:00,105
country and they were baffled by this

1122
00:38:00,105 --> 00:38:01,785
they were like well in other countries

1123
00:38:01,785 --> 00:38:03,585
we keep the interesting people who are

1124
00:38:03,585 --> 00:38:05,175
creating conflict but in amoy

1125
00:38:05,175 --> 00:38:06,765
erica we wanted things to be just

1126
00:38:06,765 --> 00:38:08,445
like that's the thing about americans they

1127
00:38:08,445 --> 00:38:10,275
want everything to be just and and

1128
00:38:10,275 --> 00:38:12,555
for justice to have happened so they're

1129
00:38:12,555 --> 00:38:15,285
like this person is yelling they do

1130
00:38:15,285 --> 00:38:16,545
not deserve this and they vote them

1131
00:38:16,571 --> 00:38:18,405
out which makes for poor teddy actually

1132
00:38:18,405 --> 00:38:21,105
seems that surprises me because on the

1133
00:38:21,105 --> 00:38:22,515
show think in this country they would

1134
00:38:22,515 --> 00:38:24,225
want to keep the fuckin weirdo know

1135
00:38:24,495 --> 00:38:25,305
before we were

1136
00:38:25,335 --> 00:38:27,885
all reality tv obsessed and like and

1137
00:38:27,885 --> 00:38:29,595
started getting so yeah d that we

1138
00:38:29,625 --> 00:38:31,215
couldn't back or something yeah back at

1139
00:38:31,215 --> 00:38:32,355
the time it was like no i

1140
00:38:32,355 --> 00:38:34,335
want i want things to be fair

1141
00:38:34,365 --> 00:38:35,685
that's the one thing about americans is

1142
00:38:35,685 --> 00:38:37,215
they always want things to be fair

1143
00:38:37,245 --> 00:38:39,915
i think american who oh who am

1144
00:38:39,915 --> 00:38:41,715
i to talk about take a bray

1145
00:38:41,715 --> 00:38:44,475
off course that's the thing about americans

1146
00:38:44,475 --> 00:38:45,315
just wearing a bray

1147
00:38:45,765 --> 00:38:49,695
does this thing about americans um but

1148
00:38:49,695 --> 00:38:51,765
no i just you see it in

1149
00:38:51,765 --> 00:38:53,385
so much of life of just like

1150
00:38:53,415 --> 00:38:55,605
you know i always feel like that's

1151
00:38:55,605 --> 00:38:58,665
how we feel about i don't know

1152
00:38:58,665 --> 00:39:00,345
politics in the world and stuff like

1153
00:39:00,345 --> 00:39:01,755
that is like we're like it's not

1154
00:39:01,755 --> 00:39:03,735
fair that's our biggest problem with it

1155
00:39:03,735 --> 00:39:05,265
is is not is that the liberal

1156
00:39:05,265 --> 00:39:05,655
snow

1157
00:39:05,685 --> 00:39:09,435
flake cuhk perspective it's not involve air

1158
00:39:09,465 --> 00:39:11,236
baby no that's what i mean is

1159
00:39:11,265 --> 00:39:13,425
like when you realize that life is

1160
00:39:13,425 --> 00:39:15,375
generally there is no justice and there

1161
00:39:15,375 --> 00:39:18,135
is no karmic scales of balance activists

1162
00:39:18,495 --> 00:39:19,988
and well but but i think the

1163
00:39:20,055 --> 00:39:21,405
reason we get upset about that is

1164
00:39:21,405 --> 00:39:23,655
because that is up to us like

1165
00:39:24,015 --> 00:39:25,815
there i'm not talking about karma

1166
00:39:25,875 --> 00:39:28,215
but in terms of things being just

1167
00:39:28,215 --> 00:39:30,525
or unjust in this country there's so

1168
00:39:30,525 --> 00:39:32,895
much we could do sure ensure that

1169
00:39:32,895 --> 00:39:34,155
it is and we know what those

1170
00:39:34,155 --> 00:39:35,235
things are but people don't want to

1171
00:39:35,235 --> 00:39:36,825
do the shore you know for um

1172
00:39:36,855 --> 00:39:39,285
but here about kuk i think it's

1173
00:39:39,315 --> 00:39:41,145
you never hear that anymore yeah i

1174
00:39:41,145 --> 00:39:43,305
know you do i haven't heard it

1175
00:39:43,365 --> 00:39:44,985
i haven't seen it in such a

1176
00:39:44,985 --> 00:39:45,825
long time

1177
00:39:46,155 --> 00:39:48,075
diaphragm is it really where did you

1178
00:39:48,075 --> 00:39:49,425

1179
00:39:49,785 --> 00:39:52,665
ah okay your twitter yeah i'm a

1180

1182
00:39:57,975 --> 00:40:00,585
like soy boy has sort of eclipsed

1183
00:40:00,585 --> 00:40:01,425
it a little bit but it's the

1184
00:40:01,425 --> 00:40:02,895
same because like some people you are

1185
00:40:02,955 --> 00:40:05,235
getting offended by cook i think we

1186
00:40:05,565 --> 00:40:06,135
wind out of it

1187
00:40:06,165 --> 00:40:07,875
sale yeah well i think we we

all have to start laughing about soy

1189
00:40:09,945 --> 00:40:12,015
it's fucking ridiculous never heard of soy

1190
00:40:12,015 --> 00:40:13,845
boys that's the new thing that's a

1191
00:40:13,856 --> 00:40:15,735
new thing is they say that or

1192
00:40:15,795 --> 00:40:17,085
or they say they're not what is

1193
00:40:17,115 --> 00:40:20,055
it's tea like to testosterone is there

1194
00:40:20,055 --> 00:40:21,945
the low low to you because i

1195
00:40:21,945 --> 00:40:23,985
guess soy increases your estrogen or yeah

1196
00:40:23,985 --> 00:40:25,815
yeah so they so so they say

1197
00:40:25,815 --> 00:40:26,295
that anyone

1198
00:40:27,150 --> 00:40:29,640
is not manly enough as a soy

1199
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:31,530
boy and that's the yeah it's so

1200
00:40:31,530 --> 00:40:33,788

did oh i'm reading the twenty one

1203
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:39,150
things they don't want you to know

1204
00:40:39,150 --> 00:40:41,790
about the bachelor okay well twenty one

superfan spend thousand

1208
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:48,210
hands on a new wardrobe for the

1209
00:40:48,210 --> 00:40:51,120
show simply some condition spoon thousand on

1210
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:52,920

that's your best one thank you willing

1212
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:57,210
yup i did not feel quite good

1213
00:40:57,210 --> 00:40:58,800
because i've always wondered about this yeah

1214
00:40:58,830 --> 00:41:00,750
the food on dates goes to waste

1215
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:03,240
because the contestants already ate i'm always

1216
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:04,860
like why are we eating yeah that

1217
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:06,480
since no one wants to talk to

1218
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,260
me about food

1219
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:09,300
going to waste huh

1220
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:11,520
i want to go to ass

1221
00:41:13,758 --> 00:41:15,840
it's your food goes to your waist

1222
00:41:15,870 --> 00:41:17,490
oh i got it one on one

1223
00:41:17,490 --> 00:41:18,870
dates will often end in some sort

1224
00:41:18,870 --> 00:41:20,370
of dinner or dessert component which is

1225
00:41:20,370 --> 00:41:23,130
laid out romantically with gorgeous candles yet

1226
00:41:23,130 --> 00:41:24,780
the gorgeous never seem to try anything

1227
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:26,340
that turns out the producers filled them

1228
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:28,110
up before the date even starts so

1229
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:29,820
they'll do less chewing and more talking

1230
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:31,200
about how much they love each other

1231
00:41:31,410 --> 00:41:32,760
that makes sense okay

1232
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:34,380
they also don't think to watch tv

1233
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:35,460
on one day a week like they

1234
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:36,570
have one day off and they get

1235
00:41:36,570 --> 00:41:38,850
to watch tv that one day um

1236
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,470
oh i've never heard that i think

1237
00:41:40,470 --> 00:41:42,510
the agents know but they can't have

1238
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:44,070
any tds or music on in the

1239
00:41:44,070 --> 00:41:46,800
house because it's copyright and they wouldn't

1240
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,630
be able to broadcast it but so

1241
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:50,520
i think that they they they film

1242
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:51,510
six days a week and then they

1243
00:41:51,510 --> 00:41:52,920
give them one day to like

1244
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:54,510
watch tv or do whatever you can

1245
00:41:54,510 --> 00:41:56,130
be hard for contestants to stay in

1246
00:41:56,130 --> 00:41:57,630
shape since there's no gym in the

1247
00:41:57,630 --> 00:42:00,030
mansion and there's no says one day

1248
00:42:00,030 --> 00:42:01,350
i ran laps around the outside of

1249
00:42:01,350 --> 00:42:04,290
the house cool my workout time was

1250
00:42:04,290 --> 00:42:07,110
cut in half courtney robertson says from

1251
00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:08,640
the floor from zero to zero i

1252
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:10,020
would push myself more in the thirty

1253
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:11,370
minutes of time i had sometimes i

1254
00:42:11,370 --> 00:42:13,080
would get more if someone didn't eh

1255
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:14,730
austin schedule there you see these people

1256
00:42:14,730 --> 00:42:17,160
are now complaining about not being able

1257
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:19,260
to the cameras are filming twenty four

1258
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:20,670
seven i didn't know that because sometimes

1259
00:42:20,670 --> 00:42:22,980
they don't have footage of certain things

1260
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:24,540
i feel like like people sleeping

1261
00:42:25,590 --> 00:42:26,428
that's what i want to see

1262
00:42:27,630 --> 00:42:29,790
um okay what if this show where

1263
00:42:29,790 --> 00:42:31,500
it was just us asleep one week

1264
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:34,950
wait this took one look at pedro

1265
00:42:35,070 --> 00:42:37,230
overnight fantasy suite dates don't happen back

1266
00:42:37,230 --> 00:42:38,520
to back that's good because i always

1267
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:41,580
thought oh fucking kidding wait they're not

1268
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:44,580

00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:45,930
they were what is it like how

1270
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:47,310
so in other words the star of

1271
00:42:47,310 --> 00:42:48,660
the show isn't saying goodbye to one

1272
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:50,490
man or woman before welcoming another contestant

1273
00:42:50,490 --> 00:42:51,750
into a suite later that night the

1274
00:42:51,750 --> 00:42:52,680
stars need

1275
00:42:52,755 --> 00:42:53,970

1276
00:42:53,970 --> 00:42:55,860

1295
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:30,900

1300
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:45,210
to take a break here not so

1301
00:43:46,530 --> 00:43:47,760
we need to take a break

1302
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:49,500
but

1303
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:56,730
and we're back and um it's time

1304
00:43:56,730 --> 00:43:58,470
for a feature and i've got one

1305
00:43:58,470 --> 00:44:01,230
here it is um from twitter from

1306
00:44:01,230 --> 00:44:05,130
max susanna spear at the morava winning

1307
00:44:05,130 --> 00:44:08,130
gm are you partition right now what

1308
00:44:08,130 --> 00:44:10,680
does artesian are you partition them

1309
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:12,570
merovingian i don't know how to say

1310
00:44:12,570 --> 00:44:15,060
this everything in okay the game is

1311
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:18,600
called we to not you the game

1312
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:21,030
where each pair lorna and paul lauren

1313
00:44:21,030 --> 00:44:22,950
and scott and paul and scott have

1314
00:44:22,950 --> 00:44:24,870
sixty seconds to find as many things

1315
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:26,310
they have in common as they can

1316
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:29,010
but if the third person also has

1317
00:44:29,010 --> 00:44:30,840
that characteristic it doesn't count low

1318
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:33,030
iran for instance is trying to keep

1319
00:44:33,030 --> 00:44:34,830
scott and paul from finding anything they

1320
00:44:34,830 --> 00:44:36,720
have in common that she doesn't also

1321
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:38,610
have in common with them her score

1322
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:40,350
would be the total number of things

1323
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:41,880
scott and paul managed to find that

1324
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:44,310
she doesn't share and low score wins

1325
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:47,700
ooh that doesn't doesn't share low score

1326
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:50,010
wins i'm confused i would think high

1327
00:44:50,010 --> 00:44:51,000
score wins isn't it

1328
00:44:51,990 --> 00:44:54,180
because if you find most games high

1329
00:44:54,180 --> 00:44:55,410
school no but if it well other

1330
00:44:55,410 --> 00:44:57,390
than golf i would also think golf

1331
00:44:57,780 --> 00:44:58,650
you know what i mean if if

1332
00:44:58,650 --> 00:45:00,960
lauren finds a bunch of things and

1333
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:03,390
doesn't have them in common with paul

1334
00:45:03,390 --> 00:45:05,051
than the more things she has so

1335
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:06,300
high score wins i would think

1336
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:09,420
yeah let's play these ruins let's try

1337
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:10,740
to understand it okay i think i'm

1338
00:45:10,830 --> 00:45:12,870
doing it yeah yeah so you do

1339
00:45:12,870 --> 00:45:13,710
you want to do it with me

1340
00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:15,240
first and you're trying to find out

1341
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:16,680
things that we have in common that

1342
00:45:16,770 --> 00:45:18,750
all does not having okay okay yeah

1343
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:20,760
and will and don't say you have

1344
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:23,250
it in common or irish should you

1345
00:45:23,250 --> 00:45:24,570
say i have it in common while

1346
00:45:24,570 --> 00:45:25,602
we're doing it what do what you

1347
00:45:25,605 --> 00:45:27,480
think is best way um or afterwards

1348
00:45:27,630 --> 00:45:29,760
oh no say so that yeah so

1349
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:30,900
that's all because it'd be too hard

1350
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:32,430
to yeah okay hold on a second

1351
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:33,930
