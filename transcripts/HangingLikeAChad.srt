54
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,970
so the only seats that were left

55
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:04,140
in this theater if we wanted to

56
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:04,980

57
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:07,620
front row law but you're reclining that

58
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:10,020
we're highlighting and so we did it

59
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:11,700
and then during the trailers i was

60
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,740
thinking this was a mistake yeah but

61
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:15,360
then we just you just adjust

62
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:17,220

63
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,120
and i don't know if i would

64
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,370

114
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:04,350
lighter note but it was somewhat lighter

115
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:04,560

i'm at a place nearby that we

124
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:27,660
really like and it was a game-time

125
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:29,160
decision you didn't know whether you're going

126
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,410
to have dinner no we had kind

127
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:32,640
of said and then afterwards we'll go

128
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:35,130
have dinner can i ask without asking

129
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:37,320
too many personal details was the theater

130
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,880
in your neighborhood or was this in

131
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,650
a different neighborhood the theater and the

132
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:42,990
restaurant somewhere you don't typically go it's

133
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:44,795
both the rest of the restaurant the

134
00:04:44,795 --> 00:04:44,880
thi

135
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,140
we are very near each other in

136
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:47,850
a neighbourhood that is adjacent to ernie

137
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,550
okay okay and so we will come

138
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:53,820
to figure out yeah yeah jackie morrison

139
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,990
breakfast all day checkbox you get your

140
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:00,360
tacos gives you tacos thirty five times

141
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:00,797
per day

142
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:04,140
and as you remember i was in

143
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:05,820
a jack in the box for screaming

144
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:08,460
because my fast food place no longer

145
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:10,200
serve breakfast oh that's right that's right

146
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,689
but there's did my favorite thing in

147
00:05:12,689 --> 00:05:14,250
that i think you should leave sketches

148
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:18,360
thirty or fifty five coffees yeah it's

149
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:21,960

151
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,090
so ah we said we were a

152
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:26,790
little little hungry even though you could

153
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:27,990

eating a full meal in the dark

157
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,900
