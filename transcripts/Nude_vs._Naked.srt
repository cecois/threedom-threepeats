because i don't care do leave tips

74
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:50,430
yes always works you must mean to

75
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:51,540
i mean i didn't know that that

76
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:53,550
was even a thing until cool up

77
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,350
who used to have the job of

78
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,140
of servicing rooms that was late that

79
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:00,390
was a late relation for me too

80
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:01,920
yeah i didn't know that then i

81
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,090
felt kind of bad and sometimes i

82
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:05,430
forget i also think and it's been

83
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:06,480
a long education of like

84
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:08,370
who gets tipped and who doesn't you

85
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:09,540
know and it's always a question of

86
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:10,710
like do we tip them i think

87
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:13,320
all tips should be abolished yeah because

88
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,000
it's refusal or you should tip every

89
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,650
single person in your life for everything

90
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:18,864
you but you you'd think all teams

91
00:03:18,864 --> 00:03:20,940
should be abolished in favour of people

92
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:22,350
getting paid more or just you want

93
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:23,220
to get rid of the tips no

94
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,690
no everyone i want everyone to have

95
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:26,430
nothing everyone should get paid what they're

96
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:26,640
worth

97
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,620
earth or there should never be a

98
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:30,930
question about it where just like we

99
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:32,970
tip ryan after he records us we

100
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:35,880
tip kevin for you know like every

101
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,800
single like we we hung out last

102
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,910
year she tip us for being on

103
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:40,050
your show that's why i mean we

104
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:41,970
tell me we left over for him

105
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:43,110
last night we hung out and we

106
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:44,550
all had dinner we should all tip

107
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:46,200
each other did you get all steamed

108
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:46,290
up

109
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,550
i did not hear you shout i

110
00:03:50,551 --> 00:03:51,030
didn't

111
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:55,950
anyway well to a native i like

112
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:58,170
to hybridize with stuff like that and

113
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:00,240
i've like at points i've wanted to

114
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,300
do something regarding that like write something

115
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:05,580
or a tip guide yeah something like

116
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:07,860
that because a manifesto i go maybe

117
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:10,980
funny sort of but also factual thing

118
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:12,240
i i've been

119
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,170
cause i think it's something i would

120
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:14,790
really like to have but it would

121
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:15,900
require me to do a lot of

122
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:18,660
research because i still get confused all

123
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:20,070
the time about whether i should or

124
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:23,100
not in certain situations like if you

125
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:25,324
have a company car like if you're

126
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:27,600
given a ah a business who sets

127
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,920
up a car for you yes and

128
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,450
they take you to the airport do

129
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:32,400
you tip them i often do because

130
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:34,440
i feel rude not tipping them but

131
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,030
then i've been told you don't have

132
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:37,350
to because the company tips them know

133
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:38,730
the company yeah but it depends who

134
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:39,840
tells you that you don't have to

135
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,640
tip them because one time i remember

136
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,290
one time being told like you don't

137
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:44,580
tip the owner at a bar if

138
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:46,560
the owners behind the bar and he's

139
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,900
serving drinks if he's the owner he's

140
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,190
getting on the profits you don't tip

141
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:51,990
him how would you know well that's

142
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:52,410
the thing

143
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:54,600
i asked well yeah but you would

144
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,400
know if you if you go there

145
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,810
a lot go there a lot right

146
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,480
and so i asked ah a friend

147
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,100
of mine who was a part owner

148
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,720
in a bar and i said i

149
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,670
heard that you don't tip the owner

150
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:08,490
and this guy said i think you

151
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:10,440
tip based on the service no matter

152
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,510
who it is but people have different

153
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:12,720
belief

154
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,040
leafs about that them and and they

155
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,920
do but here's the thing people's beliefs

156
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,350
are always anything contrary is always a

157
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:21,570
justification to not tips not tip yeah

158
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,490
oh so he was saying you don't

159
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,710
have to tip because this guy thought

160
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:28,018
he shouldn't have to tip because if

161
00:05:28,018 --> 00:05:29,610
the owners making all the money but

162
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:30,900
he presented it as if it was

163
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,880
a known piece of etiquette right

164
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,680
right and i was a gullible idiot

165
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:36,690
and i fucking swallow that shit up

166
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:39,180
like babies food yeah and then i've

167
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:41,285
felt like a real fool well and

168
00:05:41,285 --> 00:05:43,980
then was like nail salons oh definitely

169
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:45,660
tip but when i read a whole

170
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:48,060
article about how they really need the

171
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:49,800
tips because they get paid especially in

172
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,630
new york there was a whole expo

173
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:52,740
say about it but they get paid

174
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:56,340
so little that it's like offensive and

175
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:58,330
that's my that's my whole point is

176
00:05:58,330 --> 00:05:59,820
is like we should be paying people

177
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,980
more like the the people who service

178
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:03,930
the rooms we don't know how they

179
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:05,670
do how you know like we didn't

180
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:06,840
know how they do we don't we

181
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,130
don't know if they're doing well because

182
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:09,450
we're gone we're not paying the hotel

183
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:11,070
anymore so it's not based on soon

184
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:12,750
but it's if you it is if

185
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:13,170
you've used

186
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,250
em for like a week and yeah

187
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:16,170
but come in like cody come in

188
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:17,231
the bank of the upset oh yeah

189
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,500
i mean like charles j these people

190
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:22,590
more do you tip every time they

191
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:24,270
come in the room or do you

192
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:25,620
tip at the end because that only

193
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:27,090
one person gets it and it might

194
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:28,980
be a different person hopefully they pull

195
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:30,330
it but i mean this is what

196
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:31,680
i'm saying about tips are an imperfect

197
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,360
system where like and then there's

198
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:34,920
the thing where i've had terrible service

199
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,420
at both of the restaurants we've been

200
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:38,812
to on this trip but we go

201
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:40,920
and i can't i can't i feel

202
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,120
like i still have to tip twenty

203
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,760
five percent yeah everywhere i go buy

204
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:47,430
me up for me says nice service

205
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:49,740
for to give a bad tip something

206
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:52,440
would have to be extraordinarily bad like

207
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,340
where this person

208
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:55,500
this person actively is trying to ruin

209
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,840
my day well i didn't do this

210
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,550
in complaint corner last episode but can

211
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:01,050
i tell you about the last let's

212
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:02,490
reopen the complaint quarter play the jingle

213
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:05,880
and i'm playing to do so she

214
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,140
was so nice i have to say

215
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:08,100
she was so nice i'm not going

216
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,690
to say what hotel it was but

217
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:12,540
ah i ordered breakfast and she was

218
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:13,680
very bright and cheery

219
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:18,000
sorry but i had a complicated order

220
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,860
and she didn't write it down

221
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,400
and the whole time i'm saying it

222
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,960
i'm like you should be writing this

223
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,480
down she came back for clarification because

224
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,970
she forgot half of it i clarified

225
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:32,250
it and then the the food was

226
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:32,580
wrong

227
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,700
yeah you like to order your standard

228
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:36,660
order is you want a bowl of

229
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:38,610
oatmeal with a little moat cut in

230
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:40,350
the centres sure and then you want

231
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:42,626
coffee inside that and they're avoiding the

232
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:45,180
coffee yes floating on the coffee you

233
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:47,100

scrambled egg and a shape of a

235
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:50,940
boat yeah and then the flag should

236
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:52,620
be a toothpick with an orange wedge

237
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:53,760
on the sun then she wants i

238
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,950

240
00:07:57,874 --> 00:07:59,820

242
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,330

00:10:23,945 --> 00:10:25,445
you're not writing it down even if

311
00:10:25,445 --> 00:10:26,705

314
00:10:29,165 --> 00:10:31,115
know it's a weird pressure thing that

315
00:10:31,115 --> 00:10:33,095
restaurants put on people it's stupid it

316
00:10:33,095 --> 00:10:35,285
doesn't make any sense for restaurant restaurants

317
00:10:35,285 --> 00:10:36,755
want people to remember it i don't

318
00:10:36,755 --> 00:10:38,465
think restaurants do ever so i think

319
00:10:38,495 --> 00:10:39,785
paul did tell us there are some

320
00:10:39,785 --> 00:10:41,465
restaurants where like the look is like

321
00:10:41,645 --> 00:10:43,595
oh write that shit down yeah like

322
00:10:43,595 --> 00:10:44,885
you know i don't think it's ever

323
00:10:44,885 --> 00:10:46,895
the servers idea like why would it

324
00:10:46,895 --> 00:10:47,855
be you know

325
00:10:47,975 --> 00:10:49,565
i think this place was just she

326
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:51,365
didn't she wasn't carrying it was this

327
00:10:51,365 --> 00:10:53,405
here someplace else this was in kansas

328
00:10:53,405 --> 00:10:55,565
city in kansas city so i think

329
00:10:55,565 --> 00:10:57,095
it was just shoot i think so

330
00:10:57,455 --> 00:10:59,075
every experience i've ever had with it

331
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:00,815
is a server's lazy doesn't have their

332
00:11:00,815 --> 00:11:02,195

where people just order whatever you know

338
00:11:10,775 --> 00:11:12,725
like i'll have this thing they don't

339
00:11:12,725 --> 00:11:14,525

way i didn't tell you a story

448
00:15:16,325 --> 00:15:17,795
this is really anything so story time

449
00:15:18,245 --> 00:15:20,735
so a couple a few years ago

450
00:15:20,765 --> 00:15:25,745
i went on a bachelor party

451
00:15:26,885 --> 00:15:28,685
i want to like a bachelor party

452
00:15:28,715 --> 00:15:30,905
trip to vegas with with a coed

453
00:15:30,905 --> 00:15:34,085
group and the way it shook out

454
00:15:34,085 --> 00:15:35,735
with the rooms for some reason me

455
00:15:35,735 --> 00:15:36,875
and this other guy were sharing a

456
00:15:36,875 --> 00:15:39,725
room we had two beds and he's

457
00:15:39,755 --> 00:15:41,705
married and it was true as truly

458
00:15:42,305 --> 00:15:44,345
where the orange zones leptonic you put

459
00:15:44,345 --> 00:15:45,904
yourself in the friends i put into

460
00:15:45,904 --> 00:15:46,655
on the friends of

461
00:15:47,045 --> 00:15:49,445
and so we didn't care like we're

462
00:15:49,445 --> 00:15:50,765
like whatever we'll just share a room

463
00:15:50,765 --> 00:15:51,545
like we've known each other a long

464
00:15:51,545 --> 00:15:54,215
time yeah and when we were falling

465
00:15:54,215 --> 00:15:56,167
asleep it was the funniest thing because

466
00:15:56,167 --> 00:15:58,655
we talking and then we were like

467
00:15:59,045 --> 00:16:01,175
we both have like partner like we

468
00:16:01,175 --> 00:16:02,735
started laughing so hard because he's like

469
00:16:02,735 --> 00:16:04,205
my wife like i why am i

470
00:16:04,235 --> 00:16:06,695
talking to you in this room and

471
00:16:06,695 --> 00:16:07,145
not my

472
00:16:07,205 --> 00:16:08,915
why like what is happening this is

473
00:16:08,915 --> 00:16:12,215
so weird we are adults like why

474
00:16:12,215 --> 00:16:14,045
didn't we just get separate really think

475
00:16:14,045 --> 00:16:15,335
it's true like we're being cheap or

476
00:16:15,335 --> 00:16:17,135
something like everyone was sharing a room

477
00:16:17,135 --> 00:16:18,815
and so it just worked out but

478
00:16:18,815 --> 00:16:20,945
like we were cracking up because it

479
00:16:20,945 --> 00:16:22,805
was so random and weird and it

480
00:16:22,805 --> 00:16:24,711
just doesn't happen in life online but

481
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:26,315
is very straight on the next like

482
00:16:26,375 --> 00:16:27,275
next leg of the tour

483
00:16:27,305 --> 00:16:29,105
we should all be in one room

484
00:16:29,615 --> 00:16:31,775
oh no that was wild horses' board

485
00:16:31,775 --> 00:16:32,735
a point now where we all want

486
00:16:32,735 --> 00:16:33,905
our own room like we did it

487
00:16:33,905 --> 00:16:35,285
for a while because it's like fun

488
00:16:35,285 --> 00:16:36,935
and then we're like alright alright funds

489
00:16:36,935 --> 00:16:39,245
over right but chevron over here in

490
00:16:39,245 --> 00:16:41,735
ryan over somewhere yeah i guess he's

491
00:16:41,735 --> 00:16:43,565
taking a shit while recording the episode

492
00:16:43,565 --> 00:16:46,235
that's probably your fault that they're in

493
00:16:46,235 --> 00:16:47,465
a room together

494
00:16:48,093 --> 00:16:49,775
oh look in the mirror on that

495
00:16:49,775 --> 00:16:51,695
one you got me begged for it

496
00:16:52,055 --> 00:16:53,885
is their responsibility to book their own

497
00:16:53,885 --> 00:16:55,415
trap oh well then yeah that saves

498
00:16:55,415 --> 00:16:56,525
you money i mean it's so it's

499
00:16:56,525 --> 00:16:59,345
totally reasonable it's so maybe they love

500
00:16:59,345 --> 00:17:01,295
it here it's not even about the

501
00:17:01,295 --> 00:17:03,035

no old rio oh is in my

556
00:18:50,195 --> 00:18:52,985
thirties yeah yeah it was weird it

557
00:18:52,985 --> 00:18:55,865
was so funny it's like i've i

558
00:18:55,865 --> 00:18:56,885
feel like i've been in a handful

559
00:18:56,885 --> 00:18:58,685
of those situations all to save a

560
00:18:58,685 --> 00:19:00,485
few hundred bucks that i feel like

561
00:19:00,545 --> 00:19:02,165
in the moment it's so awkward that

562
00:19:02,165 --> 00:19:03,785
it would just be better i don't

563
00:19:03,785 --> 00:19:06,155
know i think it was that the

564
00:19:06,245 --> 00:19:07,985
the the haute the

565
00:19:08,165 --> 00:19:10,295
the club was putting them up but

566
00:19:10,295 --> 00:19:11,675
they weren't paying to put me up

567
00:19:11,735 --> 00:19:13,745
right right and so bob offered that

568
00:19:14,105 --> 00:19:16,565
so i would still make money you

569
00:19:16,565 --> 00:19:18,455
know instead of just wouldn't like lose

570
00:19:18,455 --> 00:19:20,225
money on a hotel room you know

571
00:19:20,255 --> 00:19:22,475
right so what weird things happen what

572
00:19:22,475 --> 00:19:22,835
they do

573
00:19:25,085 --> 00:19:26,765
well just being involved it was not

574
00:19:26,765 --> 00:19:29,525
there ah but i remember bob asked

575
00:19:29,525 --> 00:19:31,895
me who my favorite comedian was and

576
00:19:31,895 --> 00:19:34,565
i can remember who i said but

577
00:19:34,565 --> 00:19:37,345
i i remember c k i'd fifteen

578
00:19:37,345 --> 00:19:39,575
you know it looks like even night

579
00:19:39,575 --> 00:19:43,475
yet once everyone likes them um bill

580
00:19:43,475 --> 00:19:43,955
cosby

581
00:19:44,105 --> 00:19:46,115
but i said whoever looked up but

582
00:19:46,115 --> 00:19:48,305
that's that's also like a question that

583
00:19:48,305 --> 00:19:50,405
always paralyzed me because it always makes

584
00:19:50,405 --> 00:19:52,205
me think i'm supposed to mention somebody

always feel like you know i give

588
00:19:58,647 --> 00:20:00,515
a dumb answer that right so i

589
00:20:00,515 --> 00:20:01,865

on the other i guess i'm ignoring

740
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:43,230
you i've had this memory in my

741
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:45,450
mind she's talking of a of a

742
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:47,610
basement he's in therapy right now

743
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,160
we're the therapists

744
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:55,230
okay one i've i've always wondered what

745
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:57,210
the circumstances of this were but i

746
00:25:57,210 --> 00:26:02,190
remember being younger agents ah there it

747
00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:03,600
was yesterday and i was with my

748
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,040
brother and i was in a basement

749
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,720
somewhere of a house i don't know

750
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:10,710
and my and we were

751
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:13,740
i think there were other kids and

752
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:15,000
the other kids were like well our

753
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:16,860
our dad has playboys in this basement

754
00:26:16,890 --> 00:26:18,690
oh shit and so we looked at

755
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:20,160
these playboys for awhile so that's one

756
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,270
memory and then trying to figure out

757
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:23,130
like what was once so then the

758
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:25,170
other the other memories in there the

759
00:26:25,170 --> 00:26:26,670
other memory was that i was in

760
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:29,220
there in in in this house in

761
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:30,720
the like foil where they kept a

762
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,440
tv

763
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,930

00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:39,450
to go and it was like fifteen

767
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:40,701
minutes before the end i was like

768
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:43,530
it's almost ending and they were like

769
00:26:43,530 --> 00:26:45,300
we don't care let's go and i

770
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,010
would like search the tv guide for

771
00:26:47,010 --> 00:26:48,660
years after that trying to find this

772
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:50,820
movie oot like a replay of this

773
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:51,750
movie so i can see the

774
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:54,722
end right zone let me just say

775
00:26:54,722 --> 00:26:56,310
i didn't do that let me just

776
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:57,300
say that i got a blu ray

777
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:59,130
of scavenger on recently and i watched

778
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:02,460
the end oh closure what how was

779
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:04,200
it how many times was this it's

780
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,870
fine but i hear snyder this ah

781
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:08,340
so it turns out that it turns

782
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:10,350
out and this this is when i

783
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:11,790
was twelve because i just found out

784
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:11,910
where

785
00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:13,500
or i was because i was talking

786
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:14,910
to my mom when i was around

787
00:27:14,910 --> 00:27:17,010
spacecraft would you think it was ironic

788
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:18,120
that you were on a hunt to

789
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:22,530
find the ending to scavenger ah so

790
00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:25,440
i was twelve years old so that

791
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,370
would be thirty

792
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:27,840
sorry

793
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,500
but i found out where it was

794
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:32,430
because i was talking to my mom

795
00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:34,590
about being on tour and we were

796
00:27:34,590 --> 00:27:36,930

800
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:43,290
trip when i was twelve and she

801
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:45,150

802
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:47,130
said and but did we ever go

803
00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:48,810

lovers because our relatives live there and

808
00:27:56,730 --> 00:27:58,560

809
00:27:58,560 --> 00:27:59,700

00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:03,450
to dinner there and they they got

811
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:05,580
really drunk and kept fucking up the

812
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:08,850

813
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:09,210
turn the

814
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:10,890
oven on and everything any went three

815
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:12,838
hours and you guys kept like coming

816
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:15,270
upstairs going like we're really hungry whereas

817
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:18,510
whoa and your relatives are just trashed

818
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:21,660
and i suddenly put together that that's

819
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:23,640
the house and i was like oh

820
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,410
my i remember how and so i've

821
00:28:25,410 --> 00:28:27,180
always wondered like where the fuck was

822
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:28,650
that that i was in this basement

823
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:32,400
yes i figured it out i wonder

824
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:33,600
where i was when i was in

825
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,030
the basement there was this girl that

826
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:37,710
i was friends with in high school

827
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:39,150
it was like a newish friend to

828
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:42,330
me and ah it was always fun

829
00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:45,330
because her house her parents had recently

830
00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:47,310
gotten divorced or her monitors and endorse

831
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:49,590
from her stepdad umm al

832
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:50,010
and

833
00:28:51,210 --> 00:28:53,100
the house was like really big but

834
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:56,310
there wasn't really any furniture in it

835
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,830
and the dab takes cool i look

836
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:00,210
back at it and i think because

837
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:00,870
i always thought it was fun to

838
00:29:00,870 --> 00:29:02,100
go next we would like have all

839
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:03,510
this room to make up dances and

840
00:29:03,510 --> 00:29:03,960
stuff

841
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:07,860
like like and we're always over there

842
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:09,012
like and that's where i learned about

843
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:11,970
raman and i loved ramen noodles and

844
00:29:11,970 --> 00:29:13,050
because they always had a ton of

845
00:29:13,050 --> 00:29:15,900
it and there was um like a

846
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:17,520
big yoga like whose places are what

847
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,770
each other mature and just their cupboards

848
00:29:19,770 --> 00:29:21,690
faces what i'm saying like i look

849
00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:23,910
back and i realized oh she was

850
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:25,320
like going through a very hard

851
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:27,360
time with dad like a lot of

852
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,999
the furniture she didn't have much support

853
00:29:30,047 --> 00:29:31,260
got to shout rom and because the

854
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:32,880
kids all the time pay for the

855
00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:35,910
morgue yes and like i truly like

856
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:36,870
was like we could do whatever you

857
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:38,586
want here this is so awesome and

858
00:29:38,586 --> 00:29:41,190
things looking back i feel like whoa

00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:43,860
that was crazy that like i my

860
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:45,480
vision my understanding of it was

861
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:47,820
so skewed yeah obviously but i mean

862
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:49,920
that's so cool that like obviously probably

863
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,780
the mom was worried about what impact

864
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:52,680
does is going gonna have on the

865
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,990
kids you know and and instead it's

866
00:29:54,990 --> 00:29:57,180
like kids have just naturally optimistic way

867
00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:58,320
of looking yeah the thing we were

it's probably equally it might be less

935
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,060
weird for guys because i feel like

936
00:32:25,090 --> 00:32:26,740

00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:43,150
that you have to deal with in

996
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:45,250
your adult life i think we've established

00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:47,200
they don't do that but no you're

998
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:49,060

naked with every person you know fuck

1000
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:53,320
no man so then why bother

1001
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,690
private showers it is easier to be

1002
00:34:55,690 --> 00:34:57,040
naked with people that you are not

1003
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,300
going to see every single day of

1004
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:00,250
your life yeah it is just there

1005
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:01,690
to make kids have to be naked

1006
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:03,070
by each other like i think it's

1007
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:04,660
weird i think it's like almost child's

1008
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:07,090
asking for bullying yeah i think it's

1009
00:35:07,090 --> 00:35:08,061
challenging for

1010
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,680
i remember being uncomfortable with having to

1011
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,840
change by the lockers and in my

1012
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:16,150
locker room as a kid it was

1013
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:19,000
weird it's weird for girls to yeah

1014
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:20,980
okay i'm just saying it's too much

1015
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:23,320
pressure it's too much pressure to be

1016
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:25,810
fabulous i think every i think in

1017
00:35:25,930 --> 00:35:28,810
in junior eyes and high schools ever

1018
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:29,320
there should be

1019
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:32,020
ie one private locker changing room and

1020
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:35,110
shower for every child yeah yeah i

1021
00:35:35,110 --> 00:35:36,490
agree it's really not that much to

1022
00:35:36,490 --> 00:35:38,170
ask if you consider it like stalls

1023
00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:40,090
with a module gonna say bathroom look

1024
00:35:40,090 --> 00:35:42,160

00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:47,770

1027
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:49,480

my cross country train trip when i

1038
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:15,610
was twenty three yeah i assumed it

1039
00:36:15,610 --> 00:36:17,830
was like the forties and fifties yeah

1040
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:19,420
like scene where you have your own

1041
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:20,920
room yeah right so what was it

1042
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:23,470
yours it's like an airplane you're sitting

1043
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:26,410

1046
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:29,470
compartment

1047
00:36:29,830 --> 00:36:32,140
but you had one it's essentially the

1048
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:33,730
private compartment is like a little it's

1049
00:36:33,730 --> 00:36:35,500
like a little room with two chairs

1050
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:36,758
in it in the sliding door that

1051
00:36:36,758 --> 00:36:39,520
you can close and then you push

1052
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,200
the chairs together to make the bed

1053
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:44,320
that's wack attack it's like a job

1054
00:36:44,328 --> 00:36:47,170
that's not enough room or comfort it's

1055
00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:49,270
very dangerous really suck but it's better

1056
00:36:49,270 --> 00:36:49,960
than what i

1057
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,730
had to do which is basically sleep

1058
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:54,850
upright in a in an airplane seat

1059
00:36:54,850 --> 00:36:56,860
next to an old woman who constantly

1060
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:57,940
wants to talk to me and you

1061
00:36:57,970 --> 00:36:59,980
normally prefer to sleep upright in your

1062
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:00,520
coffin

1063
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:03,730
it was a break in the dirt

1064
00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:04,270
of your homeland

1065
00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:08,559
um i ah the last day of

1066
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:10,540
the trip i did not realize i

1067
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:13,810
had not booked the same fare class

1068
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:15,413
and so i had to go to

1069
00:37:15,510 --> 00:37:17,740
share and it was actually better than

1070
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:19,270
the bed oh really yeah it really

1071
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:20,680
was well because you're not given the

1072
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:23,350
idea that you might get comfortable like

1073
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,820
there's some part of the chair was

1074
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:25,480
comfortable enough

1075
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:26,980
roof like a bed suck we went

1076
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:29,020

1080
00:37:33,910 --> 00:37:35,560
wanted everyone to know i was in

1081
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:37,510
the back row of the plane by

1082
00:37:37,510 --> 00:37:40,240
the bathroom and next to a man

1083
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,770
who was in the seat next to

1084
00:37:41,770 --> 00:37:44,620
me and i was just two seats

1085
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:45,490
on the side of the plane i

1086
00:37:45,490 --> 00:37:45,640
was

1087
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:47,320
on and i curled into a i

1088
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:48,790
took a pill to knock myself out

1089
00:37:49,090 --> 00:37:50,440
i curled into a ball it was

1090
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:51,790
like a melatonin by the way i

1091
00:37:51,790 --> 00:37:53,200
don't think i don't know what pill

1092
00:37:53,203 --> 00:37:54,700
you might be thinking i do and

1093
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:56,920
then i see curled up as tight

1094
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,420
as i possibly could and i got

1095
00:37:58,420 --> 00:38:00,400
up maybe two times in twenty hours

1096
00:38:00,430 --> 00:38:02,770
yeah and it was fine you're able

1097
00:38:02,770 --> 00:38:04,360
to do that though that's true i

1098
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:05,440
i really to do that

1099
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:07,360
i cannot sleep on a plane unless

1100
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:07,900
i'm flat

1101
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:12,100
flat on my ass

1102
00:38:14,170 --> 00:38:15,820
i sleep i could sleep and any

1103
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:17,920
plane situation but it's uncomfortable i'm not

1104
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,660
happy about it i'd rather be flat

1105
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:21,220

thanks to chevron for sending me this

1220
00:42:26,445 --> 00:42:29,265
technically speaking naked implies that a person

1221
00:42:29,265 --> 00:42:33,765
is having wrote this yeah he just

1222
00:42:33,765 --> 00:42:37,095
jotted this down for me technically speaking

1223
00:42:37,335 --> 00:42:39,405
naked implies where did this come from

1224
00:42:39,525 --> 00:42:41,505
ken kevin read it come from it

1225
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:43,365
comes from mental floss no he case

1226
00:42:43,455 --> 00:42:44,385
isn't no no

1227
00:42:44,385 --> 00:42:46,365
no shook his head no ticket if

1228
00:42:46,425 --> 00:42:48,135
if kevin starts reading stuff that i'm

00:42:48,165 --> 00:42:51,225
leaving yeah holy shit i gotta go

1230
00:42:51,255 --> 00:42:53,055
taking the happen you could take going

1231
00:42:53,055 --> 00:42:56,745
but yeah technically speaking naked implies that

1232
00:42:56,805 --> 00:42:59,595
versus unprotected or vulnerable it also describes

1233
00:42:59,595 --> 00:43:01,545
something that is unadorned or without embellishment

1234
00:43:01,605 --> 00:43:03,345
as in the oft mentioned naked truth

1235
00:43:03,495 --> 00:43:04,545
nude on the other hand

1236
00:43:04,545 --> 00:43:07,815
and means one thing and clothed think

1237
00:43:07,815 --> 00:43:10,065
of it this way if you doff

1238
00:43:10,065 --> 00:43:12,465
your duds that means close to pose

1239
00:43:12,525 --> 00:43:14,475
while descending a staircase for a two-day

1240
00:43:14,505 --> 00:43:15,285
think of it that way

1241
00:43:17,145 --> 00:43:18,765
i think there's more to the sentence

1242
00:43:18,765 --> 00:43:19,845
i know but i mean think of

1243
00:43:19,845 --> 00:43:21,015
it this way if you doff your

1244
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:22,905
duds like i'm ah dammit i'm already

1245
00:43:22,905 --> 00:43:25,275
enough not enough way back i think

1246
00:43:25,275 --> 00:43:26,745
though i see where this is going

1247
00:43:26,745 --> 00:43:28,875
and i think that you mean you

1248
00:43:28,875 --> 00:43:30,705
can be naked while having taken off

1249
00:43:30,705 --> 00:43:33,045
your own clothes meaning yes you think

1250
00:43:33,105 --> 00:43:36,195
you let me fucking finish it wow

1251
00:43:36,225 --> 00:43:36,465
heavy

1252
00:43:36,615 --> 00:43:38,115
it's two went to the trouble to

1253
00:43:38,115 --> 00:43:39,885
look up a mental floss dot com

1254
00:43:40,005 --> 00:43:42,015
if kenny looks a bit like family

1255
00:43:42,075 --> 00:43:43,545
to me then i went to the

1256
00:43:43,545 --> 00:43:45,255
trouble to tap on the text and

1257
00:43:45,255 --> 00:43:46,995
then i started reading and now the

1258
00:43:46,995 --> 00:43:48,945
train has left the station and i

1259
00:43:48,945 --> 00:43:52,155
wu near the old lady trying to

1260
00:43:52,155 --> 00:43:55,305
bug wow think of it this way

1261
00:43:55,335 --> 00:43:56,625
if you off your duds

1262
00:43:57,105 --> 00:43:58,785
to pose while just sending a staircase

1263
00:43:58,785 --> 00:44:00,555
for a tasteful painting done by a

1264
00:44:00,555 --> 00:44:03,405
respected artist than your nude if a

1265
00:44:03,405 --> 00:44:06,075
bunch of pappa razzi suddenly burst in

1266
00:44:06,075 --> 00:44:07,545
through the studio door and take your

1267
00:44:07,545 --> 00:44:10,845
picture without permission you are suddenly naked

1268
00:44:11,085 --> 00:44:13,335
wow so there was a little truth

1269
00:44:13,335 --> 00:44:14,595
to what i said there is a

1270
00:44:14,595 --> 00:44:16,485
little bit of his anxious yes

1271
00:44:17,175 --> 00:44:19,455
the ten a lot the distinction little

1272
00:44:19,455 --> 00:44:20,685
bit of like it and take starring

1273
00:44:20,685 --> 00:44:22,725
brett gelman was like and you can

1274
00:44:22,725 --> 00:44:23,745
take off your own clothes and still

1275
00:44:23,745 --> 00:44:25,545
be naked that's the one difference to

1276
00:44:25,545 --> 00:44:28,125
me yes yes but it does imply

1277
00:44:28,194 --> 00:44:30,825
vulnerability and capability not maybe not your

1278
00:44:30,825 --> 00:44:32,925
choice to be seen that way right

1279
00:44:33,615 --> 00:44:35,685
