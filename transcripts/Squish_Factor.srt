137
00:05:06,296 --> 00:05:07,770

139
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,000
by the way

140
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:15,540
for for all these weirdos who keep

141
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:18,180
writing to apologize saying stop interrupting laura

142
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:21,150
and i case in point you just

143
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:22,950
as much i literally interrupt all the

144
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:24,210
time but here's one of the things

145
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:25,650
that i think is really heightening it

146
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:27,060
and then when we can blame josh

147
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:27,780
for this for fun

148
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:31,560
sure if said josh is posting choosing

149
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:34,020
to post yeah i suppose are ones

150
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:35,820
where i am being talked over heavily

151
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:38,940
and that's just what he's into he

152
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:41,940
loves it it's fine but yeah it's

153
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:45,120
gonna highlight that okay well anyway um

154
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:47,095
look the show is built on interruption

155
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:48,960
and it will die on the sky

156
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:51,030
cannot make a proclamation due to the

157
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:51,780
fact that

158
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:54,000

00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,330
bringing the world together i just felt

191
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:10,770
like we were in a secret club

192
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:11,850

193
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:13,650

196
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:17,070

197
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:18,090
like i'm the only people that i've

198
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:20,340
literally worn them every single day since

199
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:22,675

418
00:14:56,485 --> 00:14:58,075
where we were all is that what

419
00:14:58,075 --> 00:14:59,635
we meant as far away from each

420
00:14:59,635 --> 00:15:01,735
other as we are right now literally

421
00:15:01,735 --> 00:15:03,655
so far apart we were screaming and

422
00:15:03,655 --> 00:15:05,185
we just oh but which by the

423
00:15:05,185 --> 00:15:06,505
way we were so far apart we

424
00:15:06,505 --> 00:15:06,655
can

425
00:15:06,685 --> 00:15:08,755
not have a single conversation so we

426
00:15:08,755 --> 00:15:11,545
all just chat conversations our lives we

427
00:15:11,545 --> 00:15:14,095
hadn't yeah which by the way i

428
00:15:14,095 --> 00:15:15,535
want to talk about this and we'll

429
00:15:15,535 --> 00:15:17,905
get back to beads and things and

430
00:15:17,905 --> 00:15:19,885
then get back to comics and more

431
00:15:20,275 --> 00:15:22,435
um but ah we we had been

432
00:15:22,435 --> 00:15:25,405
talking about smash burgers on a previous

433
00:15:25,405 --> 00:15:26,845
episode true and that was

434
00:15:27,104 --> 00:15:30,085
big big topic covers me up topically

435
00:15:30,235 --> 00:15:32,275
and paul didn't understand so what did

436
00:15:32,275 --> 00:15:35,395
i do paul you made smash burgers

437
00:15:35,395 --> 00:15:37,045
for me and jane you did i

438
00:15:37,045 --> 00:15:39,445
did since when are you like the

439
00:15:39,475 --> 00:15:41,935
fucking burger fare these are our our

440
00:15:41,965 --> 00:15:44,485
coven confessions that's so nice i made

441
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:47,005
smashburger delivered them i

442
00:15:47,005 --> 00:15:47,935

443
00:15:47,935 --> 00:15:50,005
house they came over here yeah oh

444
00:15:50,035 --> 00:15:51,955
um and we ate super far away

445
00:15:51,955 --> 00:15:53,965
from each other so it was good

446
00:15:54,025 --> 00:15:55,915
it was delicious it sounds really good

447
00:15:55,915 --> 00:15:59,155
so the smashburger pitched a plus i

448
00:15:59,155 --> 00:16:02,455

a hamburger but she forbids me in

452
00:16:09,715 --> 00:16:10,975

your store you gotta call your store

478
00:17:04,555 --> 00:17:06,745

me to get his superior fired right

588
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:04,580

589
00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:09,020

paul that is blowing around and shaking

592
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,130
but i think it's steady i hope

593
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:17,867
so it's very scary today i didn't

594
00:21:17,867 --> 00:21:19,220
have a daydream on the way here

595
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:21,530
of an umbrella um flying at me

596
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:24,350
and then me ducking and rolling wow

597
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:25,760
you're really athletic

598
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,290
this daydream i know and then and

599
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:28,520
then my daydream he made fun of

600
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,770
me but i did protect myself so

601
00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:31,880
i felt that it was worth it

602
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,110
this is a lot this is why

603
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:33,740
you're driving

604
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:36,290
a lot happened

605
00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:39,530
speaking of ducking and rolls you think

606
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:43,820
about somebody meaningless no of course yes

607
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,520
but that seemed like an elaborate daydream

608
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:48,680
for driving it was like ten seconds

609
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,540
but it was it was ten seconds

610
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:51,740
where you were not paying attention to

611
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:53,600
the rise slightly but sometimes i think

612
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:55,460
i think i do this a lot

613
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:56,690
where i'll have a gestalt like that

614
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:57,615

633
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:36,890

00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:09,530
for somebody it would be very weird

741
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:12,080
every single day there's ah exact set

742
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,880
of the same company order they get

743
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:14,450
a video

744
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:17,660
was just where we're at we're we're

745
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:21,080
all of their interests the same like

746
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,900
like they all just were popular movies

747
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:25,010
or was there one guy who was

748
00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:27,350
always porn or i don't think we

749
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:29,390
had any adult film no beta or

750
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:31,040
no beta porn did you guys calling

751
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:32,750
our more mature go in the porn

752
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:34,010
room with the video sir

753
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,230
i did when i was eighteen and

754
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:37,460
i was like oh i can do

755
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:40,940
this now and i remember just being

756
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:42,980
ashamed and then i went in and

757
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:45,260
the woman saying are you eighteen and

758
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:48,620
yes and me saying yes ma'am and

759
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:49,880
she didn't even check i was like

760
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:50,900
oh i could've been doing this for

761
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:51,530
a couple of years

762
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:57,440
but it seems so hard to rent

763
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,760
a porn as a kid and then

764
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:00,770
figure out how to watch it and

765
00:27:00,890 --> 00:27:02,090
it just seems like too much work

766
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:05,060
well okay you're still discovering your body

767
00:27:06,650 --> 00:27:08,480
l you're growing hair in places you

768
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,950
haven't had it before especially if you

769
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:11,780
don't have a vcr in your bedroom

770
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:13,100
like to watch it in the common

771
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:14,120
room to wait for her to go

772
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,740
to bettors everyone to go to bed

773
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:17,810
and then you have to turn super

774
00:27:17,810 --> 00:27:19,550
low and then it's way too risky

775
00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:23,270
it's way too risky yeah it's bad

776
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,940
or it's so important so much easier

777
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:27,830
i wonder if kids are like yeah

778
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:29,951
inundated no they are now it is

779
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:31,280
is that good or is it bad

780
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:32,630
i think it's great oh

781
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:36,980
i'd like picking up anything they want

782
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:38,960
now it's bad but isn't that better

783
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:41,480
than having hear about incredible shame about

784
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,650
it and having to hide it doesn't

785
00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:44,630
mean you won't feel that but you're

786
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:46,940
going to be like once fingering and

787
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:48,470
then like one second later like wow

788
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,710
nah it's better for you to have

789
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:53,750
to just kind of figure that out

790
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:55,700
she shouldn't porn be illegal until you've

791
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:56,840
had sex for the first time

792
00:27:58,730 --> 00:28:00,950
yeah so it's not an age thing

793
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:05,360
one thing that i that i hear

794
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:06,950
about a lot that they never occurred

795
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:09,200
to me is that um pp it

796
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,940
goes in the yes and i was

797
00:28:10,970 --> 00:28:11,480
like what

798
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:13,820
going around the back

799
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:17,180
they both do the same thing occurred

800
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:20,300
to me um that ah people who

801
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:22,370
were who were brought up with a

802
00:28:22,370 --> 00:28:25,310
you know unlimited porn essentially access to

803
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:28,250
porn that it it fucks them up

804
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:31,280
in their relationships in their sexual relationships

805
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:34,190
because that's how they sort of learn

806
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:35,120
what sex

807
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:37,130
right and so they think it's it's

808
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:39,260
supposed to be like porn covered in

809
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:41,630
body oil and when joking but

810
00:28:44,846 --> 00:28:47,600
with a stepsister i just actually saw

811
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,149
this um like instagram real today of

812
00:28:50,149 --> 00:28:52,760
this very religious person that i saw

813
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:54,530
my friends checking on every once in

814
00:28:54,530 --> 00:28:54,950
a while

815
00:28:56,150 --> 00:28:57,380
like you know we'll send a little

816
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:58,640
like oh here's what she's up to

817
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,050
right now if someone you know or

818
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:02,000
no no no it's like sort of

819
00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:07,070
instagram famous religious person and she married

820
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:09,110
this guy like la but i think

821
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:10,580
what it was they never kissed until

822
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:12,260
their wedding so then they posted the

823
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,690
video of that they'd be youtubers and

824
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:15,890
another on instagram okay but

825
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:18,860
anyway it's kind of fascinating and they

826
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:20,150
have a baby now and it's just

827
00:29:20,150 --> 00:29:23,960
like how they kissed really hard and

828
00:29:24,650 --> 00:29:27,890
she posted today or recently about porn

829
00:29:27,890 --> 00:29:29,000
being like if you have a porn

830
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,920
problem and so it's like it's basically

831
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,930
like a video that's going like some

832
00:29:32,930 --> 00:29:35,240
music playing and then she's like silently

833
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,320
acting out stuff while

834
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,460
like words pop up you know like

835
00:29:37,670 --> 00:29:40,070
basically tick tock format and it's like

836
00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:42,410
porn isn't porn is a bad addiction

837
00:29:42,410 --> 00:29:44,390
that ruins the relationship between man and

838
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:45,890
wife like and if you have a

839
00:29:45,890 --> 00:29:47,120
problem poor and like you could fix

840
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,320
it move it it's like it just

841
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:49,490
and then she's kind of like bopping

842
00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:51,080
around like smiling like pointing at the

843
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,120
words right pointing at her bible

844
00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:58,070
super weird read this thing but just

845
00:29:58,070 --> 00:29:59,330
like porn is it was all the

846
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:01,460
reasons why porn is like really horrible

847
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:05,870
well here's my counterpoint is counter poison

848
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:09,140
gas sexism mysterious i remember when i

849
00:30:09,148 --> 00:30:11,270
was fun sex best when it's one

850
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:14,480
on exactly but you um so

851
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,580
so this almost stopped threesomes i never

852
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:19,430
saw i never saw like ah an

853
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:21,560
actual porn where it was like insertion

854
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:25,370
until i was eighteen um muzzles off

855
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:28,190
and everything before then was just like

856
00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:30,680
weird cinemax movies the that i killed

857
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:32,180
her with your penis next to the

858
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:34,640
vagina were simulated in every

859
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,954
motion and saxophones are playing with yeah

860
00:30:36,993 --> 00:30:38,610
like a lot of butts soft core

861
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:41,280
yeah yeah soft core porn so i

862
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,660
remember the first time i saw porn

863
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:44,280
i was like shocked that i was

864
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:45,720
like oh i didn't even know porn

865
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,970
was poor i thought it was there's

866
00:30:47,970 --> 00:30:49,980
the front yeah but i thought it

867
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:51,690
was like playboy where you don't see

868
00:30:51,690 --> 00:30:53,640
anything and was simulated or whatever yeah

869
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,410
so i was like oh

870
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,450
but then it actually was like oh

871
00:30:57,450 --> 00:30:59,100
so that's what you're supposed to do

872
00:31:00,390 --> 00:31:01,860
i mean i think that's like it's

873
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:04,860
it's like fine in an educational sense

874
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:06,660
but like it's so it can be

875
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:08,550
anything and that's i think there's so

876
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:11,310
much now that like you could click

877
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:13,200
on something that's like really scarring yeah

878
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:14,940
i mean like totally totally the one

879
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:16,530
of the things i've seen on accident

880
00:31:16,530 --> 00:31:18,540
that are just like terrifying it's like

881
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:20,130
ah like yeah and being a little

882
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:20,338
kid

883
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,890
having no way to process yeah so

884
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:24,240
yeah maybe there should be like a

885
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,040
porn site that's good for

886
00:31:27,330 --> 00:31:28,500
people teenagers

887
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:32,250
like i'm not teaching this is really

888
00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:32,850
bad

889
00:31:34,050 --> 00:31:35,640
no but i will say i took

890
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,560
a human sexuality class in college when

891
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,300
i was nineteen or seventy just a

892
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:44,070
negative na and and i took it

893
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:45,390

895
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:47,370
it was like

896
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:51,870
essentially just this teacher showing movies and

897
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:53,880

my friend did i used to sneak

1173
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:41,860
into so many movies that we

1174
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:43,750
we we were gonna write a book

1175
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:44,890
a wanted poster

1176
00:41:46,330 --> 00:41:47,560
wanting to losers

1177
00:41:49,844 --> 00:41:51,310

00:41:51,310 --> 00:41:52,900
it to furs about how to sneak

1179
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:55,210
into a movie and all the thought

1180
00:41:55,210 --> 00:41:58,330
processing one page long know we have

1181
00:41:58,330 --> 00:41:59,920
so many theories on how to do

1182
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:03,400
it theories and and i remember we

1183
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:04,960
would look up and this was mainly

1184
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,520
at the arroyo grande a six but

1185
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:08,170
we would look up we would look

1186
00:42:08,170 --> 00:42:08,260
up

1187
00:42:08,410 --> 00:42:10,990
which theater it was playing at okay

1188
00:42:10,990 --> 00:42:12,010
and we go oh my god we

1189
00:42:12,010 --> 00:42:13,450
got a straight shot because there was

1190
00:42:13,450 --> 00:42:16,000
one particular theater their big one that

1191
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,010
had an exit door lead you a

1192
00:42:18,010 --> 00:42:20,320
big one that led you not outside

1193
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:23,500
but to right there where more theatres

1194
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:25,090
were lacking you could just walk right

1195
00:42:25,090 --> 00:42:27,880
in it was good yeah i sure

00:45:33,730 --> 00:45:38,020
and it's like a podcast about children

1288
00:45:38,020 --> 00:45:39,280
i think because this podcast was all

1289
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:42,550
about her having a child by herself

1290
00:45:42,970 --> 00:45:45,340
in like her i don't know bedroom

1291
00:45:45,370 --> 00:45:49,570
thirty or forty oh um but at

1292
00:45:49,570 --> 00:45:51,640
the time nobody was really doing this

1293
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:53,860
some raw but she's successful she draws

1294
00:45:53,890 --> 00:45:56,140
and writes kathy yes but she was

1295
00:45:56,470 --> 00:45:58,420
hitch she was talking about and by

1296
00:45:58,420 --> 00:45:59,680
the way she's like really cute like

1297
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:01,210
it's very funny to see her because

1298
00:46:01,270 --> 00:46:03,100
she's not like an act yeah yeah

1299
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:05,710

thank you kathy periodically as to oh

1304
00:46:15,370 --> 00:46:16,600
and it doesn't go well but that's

1305
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:19,990
actually not a bad catchphrase like watching

1306
00:46:19,990 --> 00:46:21,880
the guy is horny well that's what

1307
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:23,410
they do on the bachelor it's like

1308
00:46:23,710 --> 00:46:25,630
tj's on a walk out oh wait

1309
00:46:25,660 --> 00:46:28,420
watch they're all the woman's shopping like

1310
00:46:28,540 --> 00:46:29,980
yeah it's always like hey here's a

1311
00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:31,390
great date where i'm gonna take you

1312
00:46:31,390 --> 00:46:32,671
shopping and you're gonna try

1313
00:46:32,740 --> 00:46:34,713
on several physically right do you think

1314
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:37,136
it's because of pretty woman so ugly

1315
00:46:37,239 --> 00:46:38,890
they love is the reason why it's

1316
00:46:38,890 --> 00:46:40,210
good for the woman is that she

1317
00:46:40,210 --> 00:46:42,040
comes home with twenty bags of clothes

1318
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:43,960
that you get free plus jewelry big

1319
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:45,672
mistake yeah yeah and they get tons

1320
00:46:45,672 --> 00:46:47,650
of other girls are always really challenged

1321
00:46:47,650 --> 00:46:49,990
of like she got twenty thousand dollars

1322
00:46:49,990 --> 00:46:51,760
where the stuff and and all we

1323
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:52,900
did was we wrote horse

1324
00:46:53,110 --> 00:46:54,220
i mean it's true it doesn't really

1325
00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:56,590
ever make sense like why did they

1326
00:46:56,590 --> 00:46:58,364
get that one person to go do

1327
00:46:58,450 --> 00:47:00,219
it in order to cause drum well

1328
00:47:00,219 --> 00:47:01,570
i know but it's just you know

1329
00:47:01,660 --> 00:47:03,250
it because with the alcohol was four

1330
00:47:03,250 --> 00:47:05,710
i guess i'm out but my point

1331
00:47:05,710 --> 00:47:06,940
is more that she told this story

1332
00:47:06,940 --> 00:47:09,790
about um visiting her daughter at college

1333
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:11,770
like her graduation or something and she

1334
00:47:11,770 --> 00:47:13,630
was like so proud of her and

1335
00:47:13,630 --> 00:47:15,280
just thinking like how amazing it was

1336
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:15,460
and she

1337
00:47:15,460 --> 00:47:17,020
she saw her across the campus and

1338
00:47:17,020 --> 00:47:18,580
she was like she's so beautiful and

1339
00:47:18,580 --> 00:47:19,420
she's like then i walked right up

1340
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:21,010
to her and said like in-universe your

1341
00:47:21,010 --> 00:47:22,870
hair and it just like funny how

1342
00:47:22,990 --> 00:47:24,760
she's like i couldn't control myself like

1343
00:47:24,790 --> 00:47:26,260
even though i like that's how she's

1344
00:47:26,262 --> 00:47:29,110
like wow bombs do like ross just

1345
00:47:29,110 --> 00:47:31,450
so strong describing like the way she

1346
00:47:31,450 --> 00:47:33,700
felt an a hole all she felt

1347
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:35,440
was proud and then like she walked

1348
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:35,620
up to

1349
00:47:35,650 --> 00:47:37,300
her and was like that's incorrect said

1350
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:38,950
something like you need to johnson crunch

1351
00:47:38,950 --> 00:47:42,010
yeah i that's weirdly comforting to yeah

1352
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:43,750
yeah yeah i think it's because i

1353
00:47:43,750 --> 00:47:45,248
think it's so true it's like i

1354
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:46,150
couldn't have been the only thing your

1355
00:47:46,150 --> 00:47:47,170
mom was thinking about that but then

1356
00:47:47,170 --> 00:47:48,820
it's like the one thing that comes

1357
00:47:48,850 --> 00:47:50,770
out is like i think she has

1358
00:47:50,770 --> 00:47:52,720
awareness of it later because the one

1359
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:54,910
time i've seen them this year was

1360
00:47:54,910 --> 00:47:55,780
when i had to go down

1361
00:47:55,780 --> 00:47:57,460
down and and take care of my

1362
00:47:57,460 --> 00:47:59,170
dad because my mom have an operation

1363
00:47:59,170 --> 00:48:01,930
so i went down and we just

1364
00:48:01,930 --> 00:48:04,090
got into a like my right before

1365
00:48:04,090 --> 00:48:05,320
i left we got into a big

1366
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:07,360
fight because i went to pick up

1367
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:09,760
her pain medication and i went and

1368
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:11,080
you took all of them before you

1369
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:14,620
go yes oh you oh you're saying

1370
00:48:14,980 --> 00:48:15,940
i shoulda have

1371
00:48:17,950 --> 00:48:19,960
now i went to the pharmacy's she

1372
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:22,720
doesn't normally go to and referential upset

1373
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:23,968
and she was upset at me and

1374
00:48:24,070 --> 00:48:25,600
and it was a big fight and

1375
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:27,430
like i was like mom i know

1376
00:48:27,430 --> 00:48:28,660
you like things the way you like

1377
00:48:28,660 --> 00:48:30,250
things but you got the pills what's

1378
00:48:30,250 --> 00:48:32,470
wrong anyway so like two days later

1379
00:48:32,590 --> 00:48:34,090
i got a call i'm sorry i

1380
00:48:34,090 --> 00:48:36,100
said you were fat it's funny

1381
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:37,986
years ago i'm still waiting for that

1382
00:48:41,050 --> 00:48:42,580
now with that sorry wait so two

1386
00:48:48,310 --> 00:48:50,830
awareness maybe in your mind while it's

1387
00:48:50,830 --> 00:48:52,480

in heaven i'll get all those apologies

1390
00:48:56,814 --> 00:48:57,910
when i think you're going to have

1391
00:48:57,910 --> 00:48:59,080
it interesting i don't

if you want to don't you do

1466
00:51:12,565 --> 00:51:14,605
it i'm like because we do because

1467
00:51:14,605 --> 00:51:16,555
we owe everything to be equal for

1468
00:51:16,675 --> 00:51:18,265
yes it's nice or at least you

00:51:18,265 --> 00:51:20,365

1470
00:51:20,365 --> 00:51:21,276
the stuff i'm just asking you to

1471
00:51:21,276 --> 00:51:23,185
do thirty by yes my responses like

1472
00:51:23,185 --> 00:51:24,355
we do so much that you don't

1473
00:51:24,355 --> 00:51:27,085
even acknowledge that is being done that

1474
00:51:27,085 --> 00:51:29,815
makes everything great yeah and all i

1475
00:51:29,815 --> 00:51:30,984
want is for like me to know

1476
00:51:30,984 --> 00:51:31,915
how to do these things

1477
00:51:31,945 --> 00:51:33,385
and then they're like we do stuff

1478
00:51:33,385 --> 00:51:35,785
too and it's like okay like yeah

1479
00:51:35,845 --> 00:51:38,485
we work out but it takes hours

1480
00:51:38,515 --> 00:51:39,895
like it does feel like i do

1481
00:51:39,925 --> 00:51:42,415
i do believe that there is a

1482
00:51:42,445 --> 00:51:46,195
like imbalance of yeah that stuff and

1483
00:51:46,195 --> 00:51:48,595
with most relationships like brothers it's to

1484
00:51:48,603 --> 00:51:49,765
a point where i'm like upset about

1485
00:51:49,765 --> 00:51:51,115
it it's more just like that's why

1486
00:51:51,115 --> 00:51:51,985
it comes out in that way

1487
00:51:52,285 --> 00:51:53,725
when she's a mom ish sort of

1488
00:51:53,725 --> 00:51:55,075
thing to do and so it's fast

1489
00:51:55,081 --> 00:51:56,755
and so that that's triggering for him

1490
00:51:56,755 --> 00:51:58,195
because of his mom yeah like ah

1491
00:51:58,230 --> 00:52:00,115
does that particular thing and so it's

1492
00:52:00,115 --> 00:52:02,125
yeah so maybe if you didn't do

1493
00:52:02,125 --> 00:52:04,135
that particular thing you could get away

1494
00:52:04,135 --> 00:52:06,265
with like minute thing that he likes

1495
00:52:06,325 --> 00:52:08,605
now that might be like really my

1496
00:52:08,605 --> 00:52:10,495
way of fixing it is i'll say

1497
00:52:10,735 --> 00:52:12,145
when you feel like it can you

1498
00:52:12,145 --> 00:52:12,265
do

1499
00:52:12,265 --> 00:52:13,735
do this and then he's like thank

1500
00:52:13,735 --> 00:52:14,905
you for saying when i feel like

1501
00:52:14,905 --> 00:52:16,345
this and then it's like great so

1502
00:52:16,345 --> 00:52:18,565
then and not even when you get

1503
00:52:18,565 --> 00:52:20,875
a second but when you feel yeah

1504
00:52:21,025 --> 00:52:22,885
yeah yeah if you ever feel like

1505
00:52:23,005 --> 00:52:25,465
just if you ever get okay yeah

1506
00:52:25,465 --> 00:52:27,145
it's like sometime today could you do

1507
00:52:27,145 --> 00:52:28,825
this or whatever and since then i

1508
00:52:28,915 --> 00:52:30,235
then i can take it off my

1509
00:52:30,235 --> 00:52:32,425
plate in my head yeah yeah yeah

1510
00:52:32,425 --> 00:52:35,061
yeah that's good but yeah i were

1511
00:52:35,061 --> 00:52:36,745
on the topic of the dishwasher yeah

1512
00:52:37,285 --> 00:52:39,775
i would much rather load the dishwasher

1513
00:52:39,775 --> 00:52:41,875
then empty the dishwasher no it's a

1514
00:52:41,875 --> 00:52:44,905
yucky empty news is crazy how little

1515
00:52:44,905 --> 00:52:46,855
time it takes the paul i know

1516
00:52:46,855 --> 00:52:48,145
but here's the thing you don't know

1517
00:52:48,145 --> 00:52:49,615
where stuff goes no i do know

1518
00:52:49,615 --> 00:52:51,505
where stuff goes and that's the problem

1519
00:52:51,595 --> 00:52:52,105
is that

1520
00:52:52,825 --> 00:52:54,235
when you're putting the study in the

1521
00:52:54,235 --> 00:52:56,905
dishwasher you are you're putting together a

1522
00:52:56,905 --> 00:52:58,975
little puzzle which ideally take this like

1523
00:52:58,975 --> 00:53:00,175
i liked that part of it sure

1524
00:53:00,415 --> 00:53:02,005
when you're putting things away it's like

1525
00:53:02,365 --> 00:53:03,595
gotta go over here gotta go here

1526
00:53:03,595 --> 00:53:04,645
gotta go over here yeah there's a

1527
00:53:04,645 --> 00:53:06,175
lot of walking whereas if you're if

1528
00:53:06,175 --> 00:53:08,245
you're ap the sees anyone the walking

1529
00:53:08,245 --> 00:53:09,805
but it's like i wish if every

1530
00:53:09,805 --> 00:53:12,535
single child dishwasher went if i could

1531
00:53:12,535 --> 00:53:12,715
do

1532
00:53:12,745 --> 00:53:14,725
the puzzle right in front like on

1533
00:53:14,725 --> 00:53:17,395
the cabinet oh yeah if it were

1534
00:53:17,395 --> 00:53:18,925
the same thing in reverse that would

1535
00:53:18,925 --> 00:53:20,365
be what if you kept all your

1536
00:53:20,365 --> 00:53:23,965
dishes right above the dishwasher scott i'd

1537
00:53:23,965 --> 00:53:24,685
love nothing more

1538
00:53:25,975 --> 00:53:29,065
lungi has another way cabinets work some

1539
00:53:29,065 --> 00:53:30,685
cabinets could be ripped up again it's

1540
00:53:30,685 --> 00:53:32,365
good we could do that but then

1541
00:53:33,235 --> 00:53:34,765
the thing is you have to wait

1542
00:53:34,765 --> 00:53:36,565
is in our kitchen is we have

1543
00:53:36,565 --> 00:53:39,565

two shelves that are accessible and then

1545
00:53:41,245 --> 00:53:42,295
there's one shelf that we have to

1546
00:53:42,295 --> 00:53:44,155

1570
00:54:33,715 --> 00:54:35,005
thought it was i thought it was

1571
00:54:35,005 --> 00:54:37,315
helpful in these times which was a

1572
00:54:37,315 --> 00:54:39,145
person who was getting really depressed during

1573
00:54:39,145 --> 00:54:42,955
coven during quarantine me saying no no

1574
00:54:42,955 --> 00:54:43,165
you

1575
00:54:43,405 --> 00:54:45,115
really oh check the byline i was

1576
00:54:45,115 --> 00:54:46,495
like this has gotta be written by

1577
00:54:46,495 --> 00:54:46,735
ball

1578
00:54:48,565 --> 00:54:49,915
the first line is i'm a depressing

1579
00:54:49,915 --> 00:54:51,865
piece of shit i was like famously

1580
00:54:51,865 --> 00:54:54,325
a depressing piece of shit um buddy

1581
00:54:54,385 --> 00:54:56,095
but they were talking to their therapist

1582
00:54:56,095 --> 00:54:57,445
and they were like there are days

1583
00:54:57,445 --> 00:55:01,465
where the dishes are just stacking up

1584
00:55:01,555 --> 00:55:04,675
and i cannot i just can't get

1585
00:55:04,675 --> 00:55:06,535
off the couch to do yes and

1586
00:55:06,535 --> 00:55:07,675
the therapist was like

1587
00:55:08,605 --> 00:55:10,915
well a big because because he's like

1588
00:55:10,915 --> 00:55:12,535
i can't rinse them and then load

1589
00:55:12,535 --> 00:55:14,335
the dishwasher and the therapist is like

1590
00:55:14,335 --> 00:55:16,375
just run the dishwasher twice oh wait

1591
00:55:16,405 --> 00:55:17,875
yes i did man and i really

1592
00:55:17,875 --> 00:55:19,345
liked that and the person was like

1593
00:55:19,405 --> 00:55:20,845
well you're not supposed to do that

1594
00:55:21,355 --> 00:55:23,275
and the therapist said we're in the

1595
00:55:23,275 --> 00:55:25,465
middle of quarantine like take care of

1596
00:55:25,465 --> 00:55:27,415
yourself just run the dishwasher twice yeah

1597
00:55:27,715 --> 00:55:27,865
and

1598
00:55:27,895 --> 00:55:29,875
that saves so much of this person's

1599
00:55:29,875 --> 00:55:31,585
mental space he was like okay i'll

1600
00:55:31,585 --> 00:55:33,475
just run the dishwasher twice and it'll

1601
00:55:33,475 --> 00:55:35,215
get clean and it just made them

1602
00:55:35,215 --> 00:55:36,475
feel better and that it was a

1603
00:55:36,475 --> 00:55:38,875
metaphor for a larger thing like do

1604
00:55:38,875 --> 00:55:40,195
it you need to you know run

1605
00:55:40,195 --> 00:55:41,875
the dishwasher twice in whatever area of

1606
00:55:41,875 --> 00:55:43,315
your life you need to absolutely yeah

1607
00:55:43,345 --> 00:55:44,665
that was a great article those great

1608
00:55:44,665 --> 00:55:46,915
piece do you feel like you guys

1609
00:55:46,915 --> 00:55:47,665
both go to therapy

1610
00:55:48,685 --> 00:55:50,605
i have to go back i have

1611
00:55:50,605 --> 00:55:51,955
ah like last i

1612
00:55:53,605 --> 00:55:55,945
last was my therapy i don't rewatch

1613
00:55:55,945 --> 00:55:57,895
it my god sometimes i feel like

1614
00:55:57,895 --> 00:56:01,015
the smoke motors after me um i

1615
00:56:01,045 --> 00:56:02,305
yeah i went for a long time

1616
00:56:02,305 --> 00:56:04,285
and it was it was extraordinarily helpful

1617
00:56:04,285 --> 00:56:07,555
for me um but lately you know

1618
00:56:07,555 --> 00:56:10,855
i've been i've been needing it again

1619
00:56:11,035 --> 00:56:12,895
and especially with the last year has

1620
00:56:12,895 --> 00:56:13,135
been

1621
00:56:13,225 --> 00:56:15,205
really fucking tough when you stopped going

1622
00:56:15,205 --> 00:56:16,615
did you tell your therapist or did

1623
00:56:16,615 --> 00:56:18,415
you just kind of show growing less

1624
00:56:18,415 --> 00:56:21,235
and less less i believe it was

1625
00:56:21,235 --> 00:56:22,225
a while ago and believe we had

1626
00:56:22,225 --> 00:56:24,295
a discussion about it yeah you know

1627
00:56:24,355 --> 00:56:26,635
um and then i just felt like

1628
00:56:26,815 --> 00:56:27,805
i because i felt like i was

1629
00:56:27,805 --> 00:56:29,095
kind of hitting a wall with therapy

1630
00:56:29,095 --> 00:56:30,295
whereas like i was i was going

1631
00:56:30,295 --> 00:56:32,245
but i wasn't really getting anything out

1632
00:56:32,245 --> 00:56:33,115
of it i felt like i was

1633
00:56:33,115 --> 00:56:33,385
just going

1634
00:56:33,421 --> 00:56:34,825
saying the same things over and over

1635
00:56:34,825 --> 00:56:37,615
yeah right and um because you're going

1636
00:56:37,615 --> 00:56:39,115
weekly and not much i was going

1637
00:56:39,115 --> 00:56:40,855
weekly how much would change yeah yeah

1638
00:56:41,035 --> 00:56:42,175
hard during that i feel like during

1639
00:56:42,175 --> 00:56:44,275
this time because i i go but

1640
00:56:44,275 --> 00:56:46,435
i go once every two weeks now

1641
00:56:46,465 --> 00:56:50,005
on zoom um but i feel like

1642
00:56:50,305 --> 00:56:52,285
usually i just focus on like one

1643
00:56:52,885 --> 00:56:53,545
problem that's

1644
00:56:53,545 --> 00:56:54,865
like weighing on me or whatever yeah

1645
00:56:54,895 --> 00:56:56,845
like i it's it just is kind

1646
00:56:56,845 --> 00:56:58,075
of weird during this time because like

1647
00:56:58,075 --> 00:57:01,225
nothing's really happening then the whatever the

1648
00:57:01,232 --> 00:57:03,025
problem is is way bigger than it

1649
00:57:03,025 --> 00:57:04,225
probably would be if it was normal

1650
00:57:04,225 --> 00:57:05,665
time like someone having a problem with

1651
00:57:05,665 --> 00:57:06,745
a friend or something that i'm like

1652
00:57:07,195 --> 00:57:09,055
ah and it's like this isn't really

1653
00:57:09,055 --> 00:57:10,195
that big of a deal but yeah

1654
00:57:10,315 --> 00:57:11,485
right now it feels like it at

1655
00:57:11,485 --> 00:57:13,675
the very beginning of quarantine right before

1656
00:57:13,742 --> 00:57:17,035
started i tried seeing a new therapist

1657
00:57:17,068 --> 00:57:20,965
got a recommendation and it was such

1658
00:57:20,965 --> 00:57:23,365
a this this it made me realize

1659
00:57:23,365 --> 00:57:25,495
how i really lucked out the first

1660
00:57:25,495 --> 00:57:27,025
time i went because i got somebody

1661
00:57:27,025 --> 00:57:29,089
that i clicked with right away and

1662
00:57:29,089 --> 00:57:30,925
then this guy used like an he

1663
00:57:30,925 --> 00:57:33,505
was a nice man but there was

1664
00:57:33,505 --> 00:57:33,865
something

1665
00:57:33,895 --> 00:57:37,855
about his his style that was very

1666
00:57:37,885 --> 00:57:40,015
um ah

1667
00:57:41,425 --> 00:57:42,475
how to put this because it was

1668
00:57:42,475 --> 00:57:44,245
not it was not he's listening right

1669
00:57:44,245 --> 00:57:46,673
now it was not ill intended it

1670
00:57:46,673 --> 00:57:48,235
wasn't thinking what to do it about

1671
00:57:48,235 --> 00:57:49,991
he didn't choose to therapy day one

1672
00:57:50,005 --> 00:57:53,203
who's like i love three-day um he

1673
00:57:53,215 --> 00:57:55,915
eyes it came off kind of condescending

1674
00:57:56,275 --> 00:57:57,235
like he was talking to me like

1675
00:57:57,235 --> 00:58:00,475
i was a child and like borderline

1676
00:58:00,475 --> 00:58:01,225
and it was like i knew

1677
00:58:01,225 --> 00:58:02,995
no he doesn't i know he's not

1678
00:58:02,995 --> 00:58:04,225
talking down to me i know this

1679
00:58:04,225 --> 00:58:06,565
is just his style but it's not

1680
00:58:06,595 --> 00:58:08,605
enough for you yeah yeah well also

1681
00:58:08,605 --> 00:58:10,255
probably because you don't like being talked

1682
00:58:10,255 --> 00:58:12,115
down to in any area of your

1683
00:58:12,115 --> 00:58:14,635
life so when someone there's like five

1684
00:58:14,635 --> 00:58:15,865
areas of my life i love being

1685
00:58:15,865 --> 00:58:16,195
talking

1686
00:58:17,515 --> 00:58:20,125

1687
00:58:20,125 --> 00:58:22,045
between two ferns where i'm playing the

where it went oh yeah he works

1694
00:58:35,155 --> 00:58:37,345
as a movie know when

1695
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:40,525
when things would get really tough on

1696
00:58:40,525 --> 00:58:42,565
that movie because there was the post

1697
00:58:42,565 --> 00:58:45,325
process was very difficult i would watch

1698
00:58:45,325 --> 00:58:46,885
that scene where you would say you

1699
00:58:46,885 --> 00:58:47,695

1707
00:59:04,975 --> 00:59:07,225
moment before you people see when i'm

1708
00:59:07,225 --> 00:59:08,695

1709
00:59:08,755 --> 00:59:10,435
pops up because it's like so silly

1710
00:59:10,495 --> 00:59:11,905

thirty degrees colder in that room well

1972
01:08:58,945 --> 01:09:01,705
there's a chill in this room because

1973
01:09:02,365 --> 01:09:04,765
you have this problem

1974
01:09:04,885 --> 01:09:07,945
