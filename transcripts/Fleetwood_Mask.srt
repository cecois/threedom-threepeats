cameo cameo still happening ah the price

152
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,360
got raised but i'm still getting request

153
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:50,040
and you're at three hundred now ah

154
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,920
yes and you are getting a flood

155
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:54,990
of requests it was a lot yeah

156
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:57,450
but i caught up good okay okay

157
00:05:57,450 --> 00:05:58,740
now it's now it's manageable i would

158
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:00,840
hope it is manageable there are amenable

159
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:01,920
its managed exist

160
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:03,540
you're mentioning i'm mentioning it all the

161
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:05,760
time i there are still some people

162
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,680
that don't i think are not quite

163
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,940
sure of the concept and so i

164
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:11,370
message them when they give requests they

165
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,840
are huge this is what i do

166
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:13,860
are you sure you still want this

167
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:15,210
and a couple people i have not

168
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:16,860
heard back from so i think i

169
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,030
have to wait until it's almost about

170
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:19,830
to expire because even if i let

171
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:22,050
it expire that reflects poorly on

172
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,220
me i think i have to die

173
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:26,071
oh i see so i can get

174
00:06:26,071 --> 00:06:28,350
a good reading or whatever cameo who

175
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:30,720
knew there's so much well in any

176
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,420
case a you mentioned earlier last there

177
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:35,520
was somebody that i was at the

178
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,800
gym today and somebody looked really good

179
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:40,710
read like your body is so all

180
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:42,180
your michael chair katanga

185
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,290

186
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:53,970
it's like you you gotta there should

187
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:55,350
be something in between you're going to

they had cancelled their requests ah yeah

200
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:19,830
it was wild to see that thought

00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:22,080
process happening yeah well this was not

202
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,000
a cancelled request you mentioned on our

203
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:24,240

me one of your cameos yeah and

207
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:33,060
i had a guess as to who

208
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:34,410
it was who is your guest but

209
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:36,690
that person it was okay and i

210
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:38,310
was thinking who is willing to do

211
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:39,990
this yes all people yeah this guy

212
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:40,920
yeah and it turned out to be

213
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,890
this guy and this is ah zombie

214
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:44,400
i do have to

215
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:44,790
thumbs though

216
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,820
and it's not me i broke my

217
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:49,440
thumbs in a butt plug x

218
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,730
taxes are pretty went in you want

219
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:55,830
out or using them instead of books

220
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:56,790
i literally explode

221
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:00,390
um but this is this is we've

222
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:01,890
talked about him a few times this

223
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:04,440
is tall john paul john bought this

224
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:07,170
fantasy extremely tall man was trying to

225
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:10,140
disguise that it was him by spelling

226
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:12,149
his name differently upon the request and

227
00:08:12,149 --> 00:08:13,620
not realising that his name is in

228
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:16,170
the credit card information yeah exactly and

229
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:17,730
so paul knew this was

230
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:20,640
and i think his request was for

231
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,350
it to be for a friend named

232
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:24,510
scott who was starting a new podcast

233
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:26,100
yeah entreated a pep talk he was

234
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:28,890
he was feeling insecure about the podcast

235
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:31,020
but you saw you saw easy stuff

236
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,280
and you saw through it right away

237
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,540
and decided to do your own thing

238
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:35,130
and this made us all laugh this

239
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:38,160
is paul's cameo to me

240
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:42,000
me hey scott your friend john really

241
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,130
cares about you and he told me

242
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:45,480
that you're going through a hard time

243
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:49,200
that recently your dick fell off and

244
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,350
um economy the ground and around his

245
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:53,610
dirty and

246
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,630
there's like you know grass and dirt

247
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:00,510
on her dick and um

248
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:03,240
you have to wash it off and

249
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:05,910
you know obviously you have to tell

250
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:09,180
people about it and that's not obvious

251
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:12,000
so um i just want you to

252
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,260
know that your struggles while mortifying

253
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:20,670
and comical ah the real to you

254
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:22,650
and to everyone everyone knows about your

255
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:23,580
dick falling down

256
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:28,140
um i would say rinse it in

257
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:28,980
the sink

258
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,460
giving a medical advice i don't think

259
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:33,780
cleaning extended out

260
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,270
like a dry cleaner i think you

261
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:37,320
have to do it i think this

262
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,340
is something that you have to do

263
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:39,000
yourself

264
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:44,160
run the water ah until it's warm

265
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,340
if you have nothing with two taps

266
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,120
turn on the hot first just let

267
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,500
it get hot and turn on the

268
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,910
cold until you get to like a

269
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:54,840
nice one level

270
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,890
water temperature and then rinse it off

271
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:02,250
there and it's not different than any

272
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:03,990
other cameos yeah i think the little

273
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:07,320
kitchen sink isn't advertised disposal sinker greater

274
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,550
gravel or whatever goes down there you're

275
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:13,260
not technically supposed to put gravel in

276
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:13,560
the

277
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:16,320
in the thing

278
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:18,360
anyway

279
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:20,430
best of luck

280
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:23,820

would laugh it would fog up my

559
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:39,450
glasses and i'm making me have you

560
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:41,370
have taken your glasses off i did

561
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:42,930
i periodically would take them off and

562
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:45,570
read everything man it's gonna raise yeah

563
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,340
how have i figured this out yet

564
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:48,510
i don't know twitter

565
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,822
years in the priority should be fixing

566
00:19:50,861 --> 00:19:52,530
so people with glasses are mad if

567
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:54,240
they feel they fixed iphones to where

568
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,680
you can unlock them with a mask

569
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,090
on yeah i know i still didn't

570
00:19:57,090 --> 00:19:59,100
set that lagom with a mask on

571
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:02,760
but they add so many masks that

572
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:03,870
i fell for that were like the

573
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,940
ultimate for glasses wearers and it's like

574
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:07,206
they were said i fell for it

575
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,190
i thought you meant romance

576
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:11,989
i'm in love with this man cheney

577
00:20:11,989 --> 00:20:13,065
and i went through a rough patch

578
00:20:13,065 --> 00:20:14,295
and i was involved with a mass

579
00:20:15,045 --> 00:20:16,725
jamie she opened up her hearken

580
00:20:18,705 --> 00:20:21,705
vba sorry sorry sorry if you fucked

581
00:20:21,705 --> 00:20:23,925
the mask i think i go sideways

582
00:20:23,925 --> 00:20:25,605
i think it takes dude if you

583
00:20:25,605 --> 00:20:27,375
fuck the mass everybody i would be

584
00:20:27,375 --> 00:20:29,355
high fiver you so fucking hard right

585
00:20:29,625 --> 00:20:31,365
because we likely coolant would be the

586
00:20:31,365 --> 00:20:34,215
funniest fuck of all i wish i'd

587
00:20:34,215 --> 00:20:35,265
never told you guys that i was

588
00:20:35,265 --> 00:20:37,335
romantically attracted to the mast because this

589
00:20:37,335 --> 00:20:37,635
is

590
00:20:38,415 --> 00:20:40,275

591
00:20:40,305 --> 00:20:41,175

00:20:41,805 --> 00:20:42,705
yeah

593
00:20:44,025 --> 00:20:46,607
jim carrey as the mass yeah that

594
00:20:46,607 --> 00:20:48,225
is you think he ever did you

595
00:20:48,435 --> 00:20:50,205
ever did it um well you know

596
00:20:50,205 --> 00:20:51,375
you have the mcmahon tried it was

597
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:52,395
hard to take off sometimes he probably

598
00:20:52,395 --> 00:20:53,987
had his girlfriend visit the thought yeah

599
00:20:54,015 --> 00:20:55,455
people were to the shaft you would

600
00:20:55,485 --> 00:20:57,795
do voices when he would have sex

601
00:20:58,095 --> 00:21:01,875
i hope so yeah yes he probably

602
00:21:02,145 --> 00:21:03,885
has for sure he has you

603
00:21:03,915 --> 00:21:05,355
think it's been requested or he just

604
00:21:05,355 --> 00:21:06,795
provided that oh no that was an

605
00:21:06,797 --> 00:21:08,325

1112
00:39:13,701 --> 00:39:15,300

1114
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:18,600

1119
00:39:26,610 --> 00:39:28,814

yeah yeah see let's well you know

1121
00:39:30,690 --> 00:39:32,700
way i think i thought that because

1122
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:35,070
there's this black delicious song and at

1123
00:39:35,070 --> 00:39:37,260
the end he goes z lots and

1124
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:39,990
i just in my head yeah why

1125
00:39:39,990 --> 00:39:42,420
is he saying that alphabet aerobics oh

1126
00:39:42,450 --> 00:39:43,530
and at the end he goes gets

1127
00:39:43,530 --> 00:39:44,910
to z and he says see it

1128
00:39:44,910 --> 00:39:45,840
but hey maybe i'm

1129
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:48,540
i'm maybe i'm wrong how's sell zealots

1130
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:49,740
you know so yeah that's that is

1131
00:39:49,830 --> 00:39:51,900
correct and but i said it wrong

1343
00:47:58,450 --> 00:48:01,150

00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:29,320
shit

1359
00:48:30,940 --> 00:48:31,930
i'm saying something totally

1360
00:48:33,370 --> 00:48:34,570
i feel like it's are we just

1361
00:48:34,570 --> 00:48:37,420
gonna abandon this k p person being

1362
00:48:37,570 --> 00:48:39,076
i tell you what k p you're

1363
00:48:39,173 --> 00:48:41,470
not impressing your kitchen digital what i'm

1364
00:48:42,370 --> 00:48:46,000
saying is the game you in your

1365
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,987
head think of a celebrity yeah and

1366
00:48:47,987 --> 00:48:49,960
then i say what kind of shoes

1367
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:52,120
are you you're all i remember this

1368
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:53,170
now and then you say

1369
00:48:53,170 --> 00:48:55,030
this is a different thing what and

1370
00:48:55,060 --> 00:48:58,000
you know example but are you saying

1371
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,590
layer that on top of k p

1372
00:48:59,590 --> 00:49:01,509

00:49:01,570 --> 00:49:03,850
k p we're not abandoning babies okay

1374
00:49:03,850 --> 00:49:05,500
big guy let's go here and gone

1375
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:07,450
into a behind know but i think

1376
00:49:07,450 --> 00:49:09,610
it would be a very tempting let's

1377
00:49:09,610 --> 00:49:11,080
do i always literally acting out let

1378
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:13,330
me just say everything straight here yeah

1379
00:49:13,330 --> 00:49:14,560
yeah i was here to scenario that

1380
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:17,110
you just requested where we abandon the

1381
00:49:17,110 --> 00:49:20,080
game again and the humour i said

1382
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:21,460
that and you have you have a

1383
00:49:21,460 --> 00:49:23,590
heartless outlook where you think i'm i'm

1384
00:49:23,620 --> 00:49:25,090
telling the truth and you're willing to

1385
00:49:25,090 --> 00:49:26,800
do it kevin marked it on his

1386
00:49:26,950 --> 00:49:28,180
and do it to cut off the

1387
00:49:28,180 --> 00:49:30,130
power we don't do it right i

1388
00:49:30,130 --> 00:49:31,510
watched the mark and i thought we're

1389
00:49:31,510 --> 00:49:33,430
doing this we're going nowhere cutting

1390
00:49:33,490 --> 00:49:35,290
a p again no it's not happening

1391
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:36,790
and then you said oh i don't

1392
00:49:36,790 --> 00:49:38,410

1393
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:39,700

boat to the customer but each salesperson

1487
00:53:06,150 --> 00:53:07,680
