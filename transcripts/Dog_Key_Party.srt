35
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:36,570

00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:45,180
in the back right jabs and back

40
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:46,380
in the front party in the front

41
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:48,000
ships and back that's right and i

42
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,530
said all over revealed on the next

43
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,000
episode of talk so i guess what

44
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,320
i'll reveal right now is that he

45
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,610
does shops in the front i keep

46
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:54,630
them in the front although i will

47
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:54,930
say when

48
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:57,330
first got him i was like i

49
00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:58,530
should probably have these in the back

50
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:00,480
in order to have more security because

51
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,100
what if i fall on my crocs

52
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:05,130
but you can't slip them on when

53
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:06,630
they're on in the back you have

54
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:08,716
to do a little step yeah yeah

55
00:02:08,716 --> 00:02:10,650
that's then hook them onto your heels

56
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:12,180
yeah and it's it's just you know

57
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:13,650
gets rid of the whole purpose of

58
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:15,060
the comfort of crocs the whole

59
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:16,920
this is the color of crocs is

60
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,056
that you could displace your foot delicately

61
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:21,150

in the between two ferns movie and

133
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:45,330

00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:55,290
that scene that that seems like huh

138
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,800
a crazy okay back story because there's

139
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,514
a whole subplot in the movie that

140
00:05:00,514 --> 00:05:02,488

141
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:04,590
zack's family but i didn't know billie

144
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:08,760
time because i know i'm really late

145
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,020
to fig no one knew no one

146
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:11,550
really knew who she was because she

147
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:13,560
was telling us all i'm building a

148
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:13,770
show

149
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,930
don't billy isn't in the movie her

150
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:18,450
mom is i know her ums and

151
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:19,830
the moms in the movie yes so

152
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:21,630

153
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:23,400
saying like my daughter is doing the

154
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,870
music thing right now and we're seeing

155
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:26,040
how it's working out and we're like

156
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,110
oh that's very cool for her that

157
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:30,480
was twenty eighteen that we shot that

158
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,340
and that's why i chanted airways taking

159
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:34,050
places well okay so i just wondered

160
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:34,560
if they ever

161
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:36,960
yeah she does not mention anything that

162
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:38,490
the mom is up to but the

163
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:40,290
mom is very supportive and like around

164
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:41,970

i just put it on as

171
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:57,300
and her relationship with her brother is

172
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,580

never dyed my hair my whole life

245
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:36,150
until a year ago when i did

246
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:37,320
it for this random job which i've

247
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,780
complained about on here yes and which

248
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:41,160

249
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:44,340
um i but then when i saw

00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,750
throughout that process of trying get my

251
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,310
hair did not be read anymore i

252
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:47,760

253
00:08:47,801 --> 00:08:49,500
color is law and she she'll mind

254
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,120

huh

258
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:57,622

259
00:08:57,637 --> 00:08:59,730
again i kinda just assumed they you

260
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:01,044

261
00:09:01,044 --> 00:09:02,910
them but then i started noticing white

00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:05,700
hairs oh and i pulled them out

263
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,320
because i couldn't believe are they really

264
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,250
white i have to put it up

265
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:11,010

00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:36,090
people joined it right but now what

278
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:37,740
you should also do is pluck out

279
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:39,450

280
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:41,490

00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,960
grey hairs ever since she was twenty

286
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,700
i think that that i think is

287
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,200
cool like there's like i know a

288
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,700
girl who had them in had gray

289
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,110
hair in high school and she started

290
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:00,300
letting go gray and then it's it's

291
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:03,660
awesome it's like the feeling of what's

292
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:05,310
this process going to be like is

293
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:06,360
the it's kind of weird

294
00:10:07,155 --> 00:10:09,105
ah that's always interesting that people who

295
00:10:09,105 --> 00:10:10,965
just decide to do it like steve

296
00:10:10,965 --> 00:10:14,835
martin and um right now rob hebel

297
00:10:14,835 --> 00:10:16,785
with his white hair but yeah looks

298
00:10:16,815 --> 00:10:18,075
great no but i mean i guess

299
00:10:18,711 --> 00:10:20,654
for people who are just like i'm

300
00:10:20,685 --> 00:10:23,565
never even gun ah no attempt to

301
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:24,945
yeah it and it's going to be

302
00:10:24,945 --> 00:10:26,625
great for me for show business yeah

303
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:27,285
steve martin

304
00:10:27,465 --> 00:10:30,283
apparently you never really think about it

305
00:10:30,283 --> 00:10:32,175
his hair being white i mean it

306
00:10:32,175 --> 00:10:33,465
was it was grey though when he

307
00:10:33,465 --> 00:10:35,925
was young and super popular that's right

308
00:10:35,955 --> 00:10:37,875
yeah what's so strange and like what

309
00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:39,135
you but even when he was in

310
00:10:39,135 --> 00:10:40,635
father of the bride he's not that

311
00:10:40,665 --> 00:10:42,847
old yeah and he but he has

312
00:10:42,885 --> 00:10:44,465
pure right yeah even then he like

313
00:10:44,595 --> 00:10:45,825
when he took over dad roles you

314
00:10:45,825 --> 00:10:46,965
can kind of go like oh okay

315
00:10:46,965 --> 00:10:47,445
that makes me

316
00:10:47,445 --> 00:10:49,065
no sense but it's just weirder that

317
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:51,915
in the mid nineteen seventies he's twenty

318
00:10:51,915 --> 00:10:54,045
whatever and he's got totally yeah i

319
00:10:54,045 --> 00:10:55,665
mean the most popular game in the

320
00:10:55,665 --> 00:10:57,255
world and we're like yeah i get

321
00:10:57,255 --> 00:10:59,115
it i guess he wasn't written out

322
00:10:59,115 --> 00:11:00,885
of town on a rail it wasn't

323
00:11:00,885 --> 00:11:02,445
burned at the stake people allowed to

324
00:11:02,445 --> 00:11:04,425
be who he was i loved bag

325
00:11:05,265 --> 00:11:06,885
well i just don't i never wanted

326
00:11:06,885 --> 00:11:07,515
to dye my hair

327
00:11:07,605 --> 00:11:08,597
cause it feels like too much work

328
00:11:08,597 --> 00:11:09,496
and now i'm like so i'm going

329
00:11:09,496 --> 00:11:10,815
to become someone who dyes their hair

330
00:11:10,815 --> 00:11:12,855
later like yeah right but maybe i

331
00:11:12,855 --> 00:11:14,445
will i wonder if i will i

332
00:11:14,445 --> 00:11:16,125
can tell minor why would you dye

333
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:18,435
it well mine are pretty easily disguised

334
00:11:18,435 --> 00:11:20,295
at this point but it's like they're

335
00:11:20,295 --> 00:11:22,515
awesome silver threads amongst ago i will

336
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,315

there's a little patch that they had

340
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:31,365
to like put mascara because maybe it

341
00:11:31,365 --> 00:11:32,745

completely white

441
00:15:21,105 --> 00:15:23,475
it's wild yeah it was really surprising

442
00:15:23,715 --> 00:15:26,475
interesting my grandma has dyed her hair

443
00:15:26,475 --> 00:15:30,465
forever umm various colors but throughout my

444
00:15:30,465 --> 00:15:32,415
whole my whole life it's been like

445
00:15:32,415 --> 00:15:35,265
blonde but then during quarantine she hasn't

446
00:15:35,265 --> 00:15:36,855
gotten it done and now our hair

447
00:15:36,855 --> 00:15:38,655
is pure white and i i was

448
00:15:38,655 --> 00:15:40,125
so happy to find that out because

449
00:15:40,605 --> 00:15:41,175
i

450
00:15:41,325 --> 00:15:42,465
when i get older i want to

451
00:15:42,465 --> 00:15:44,385
have pure white hair that pure white

452
00:15:44,385 --> 00:15:45,885

hair go fully grey or wow really

456
00:15:52,005 --> 00:15:53,175
it looks really nice on her it's

457
00:15:53,175 --> 00:15:55,245
interesting because there is because when you're

459
00:15:58,155 --> 00:16:00,465
bright red yeah you know it always

460
00:16:00,465 --> 00:16:02,085
looks so that's like that's because you

461
00:16:02,085 --> 00:16:04,005
could see the scalp you know it

462
00:16:04,005 --> 00:16:05,895

463
00:16:05,925 --> 00:16:07,545

situation favorable to fix machines smidgen yeah

488
00:16:52,072 --> 00:16:52,281
there

489
00:16:52,785 --> 00:16:55,095
there was yeah there was probably a

490
00:16:55,095 --> 00:16:59,535
five-year period in my third maybe late

491
00:16:59,565 --> 00:17:01,425
thirties to early forties where i could

492
00:17:01,425 --> 00:17:03,585
finally grow a full beard and it

493
00:17:03,585 --> 00:17:07,755
wasn't grey and i look back at

494
00:17:07,755 --> 00:17:09,765
that period i with fondness of like

495
00:17:09,795 --> 00:17:10,905
oh man i never knew what i

496
00:17:10,905 --> 00:17:12,495
had you know sometimes i would

497
00:17:12,888 --> 00:17:15,375
but it's still a paradise as i

498
00:17:15,375 --> 00:17:18,885
feel like from the female perspective it's

499
00:17:18,885 --> 00:17:20,745
just not a big deal for a

500
00:17:20,745 --> 00:17:22,725
guy to go gray no no of

501
00:17:22,725 --> 00:17:24,105
course not like i just kind of

502
00:17:24,105 --> 00:17:26,655
think like it looks good yeah it's

503
00:17:26,655 --> 00:17:28,935
not a problem yeah right then and

504
00:17:28,935 --> 00:17:30,225
often it does look good i remember

505
00:17:30,255 --> 00:17:31,695
it's just that we are conditioned to

506
00:17:31,695 --> 00:17:32,775
think that we're not supposed to have

507
00:17:32,805 --> 00:17:33,975
that like i but i feel like

508
00:17:33,975 --> 00:17:35,745
everyone i know who has grey hair

509
00:17:35,835 --> 00:17:37,605
it looks good yeah no it's never

510
00:17:37,605 --> 00:17:38,595
i don't think it's a matter of

511
00:17:38,595 --> 00:17:40,305
looks it really is like this if

512
00:17:40,305 --> 00:17:42,195
you allow your your hair to be

513
00:17:42,345 --> 00:17:45,015
natural it could alter your entire life

514
00:17:45,045 --> 00:17:47,055
right you're a woman right you can

515
00:17:47,085 --> 00:17:49,575
absolutely affect your career which is right

516
00:17:49,575 --> 00:17:51,225
and right right right right well i

517
00:17:51,225 --> 00:17:52,965
think i think for for cert

518
00:17:52,965 --> 00:17:54,255
than men it could affect their career

519
00:17:54,255 --> 00:17:56,895
too like paul mccartney paul mckay exactly

520
00:17:56,895 --> 00:17:58,845
if he knew that he was oh

521
00:17:58,905 --> 00:18:00,885
no man would anyone listen to me

522
00:18:00,975 --> 00:18:02,535
like we should cut this out because

523
00:18:02,835 --> 00:18:03,825

524
00:18:03,825 --> 00:18:05,415

percent of the people by huge trucks

hour on on the freeway there's a

617
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,640
point when you like go down to

618
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,680
disneyland that you hit the five where

619
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,060

one split second during all of this

643
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:31,430
whole past year but i haven't been

644
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:34,310
on the sand i saw it but

645
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:36,290
i need to i i've been having

646
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:37,790
the urge to sit on the beach

647
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:38,750
but it just feels like a big

648
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:40,040
fucking hassle it

649
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,440

she's because she's really obedient by the

692
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:09,800
way so she like ran around morbidly

693
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:10,250
obese

694
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:14,930

able to run as fast as she

696
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:18,770

697
00:24:18,770 --> 00:24:20,420
yeah she is at a certain point

698
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:22,340
she poked her head above a little

699
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:24,140
tiny wall to look at something we

my dog like my dog is pretty

711
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:50,240
obedient in that sense like she'll sometimes

712
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:51,770
almost dash out of the yard if

713
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:53,240
she sees something and if the gate

714
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,010
is open or something like and then

715
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:56,510

740
00:25:47,781 --> 00:25:48,830
i had brought her and then she

741
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:50,090
was still a puppy and she jumped

742
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:51,298
right in the pool with her conan

743
00:25:51,298 --> 00:25:53,120
and it was like really chaotic oh

744
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:54,200
and she was just swimming and she's

745
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,000

746
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:56,960
and get her and it was so

crazy well that's

748
00:25:58,370 --> 00:25:59,660
yeah it's all i've ever done with

749
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:02,000
her so my previous dog rocky i

750
00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:04,190
think when the first week we got

751
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:06,530
him he accidentally fell into a pool

752
00:26:06,530 --> 00:26:08,510
that we were visiting and then never

753
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:10,160
wanted to be in a pool or

754
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:12,950
anything and and and so it's it

755
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:15,440
was such an interesting thing when we

756
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,000
went to palm springs with some friends

757
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,410
and we had a pool

758
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:23,090
and ah georgia just got like activated

759
00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:24,800
by it and we were throwing a

760
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,240
football around and this is before i

761
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,460
knew that she loves playing ball like

762
00:26:28,490 --> 00:26:30,020
we just didn't have any balls yeah

763
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:31,490
i know yeah we we had no

764
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:33,290
idea but we're throwing a football around

765
00:26:33,290 --> 00:26:35,690
me and my friend and she she

766
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:38,030
started getting so jumpy to the point

767
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:38,690
where she died

768
00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:40,250
dove into the pool to get the

769
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:41,960
football and you're like oh i think

770
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:45,860
georgia likes balls and ah and then

771
00:26:45,890 --> 00:26:46,760
and then we set up like a

772
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:49,490
huge obstacle course for her she like

773
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:51,650
ran onto some mats and then would

774
00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:53,000
jump into the pool in order to

775
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,230
get the ball that we threw and

776
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:55,910

of the donkey show i thought it

was a separate show it was a

822
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:16,250
donkey show kind of just implied a

823
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:18,650
bunch of depraved acts they probably had

824
00:28:18,650 --> 00:28:20,120
to adapt i'll google it

825
00:28:21,170 --> 00:28:22,850

826
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:23,840

as you may try to work on

1037
00:35:22,435 --> 00:35:25,375
the georgia used to not eat which

1038
00:35:25,375 --> 00:35:26,665
was very weird like we'd put her

1039
00:35:26,905 --> 00:35:28,735
especially coming off a rocky who would

1040
00:35:28,735 --> 00:35:30,655
like wolf up his food we would

1041
00:35:30,655 --> 00:35:32,575
put george's songs will fit down that's

1042
00:35:32,575 --> 00:35:34,735
interesting no it came the other way

1043
00:35:34,975 --> 00:35:35,935
yeah wow yeah

1044
00:35:36,025 --> 00:35:37,345
rocky used to go ask first

1045
00:35:38,425 --> 00:35:39,715
i used to go then you throw

1046
00:35:39,715 --> 00:35:40,015
it up

1047
00:35:43,225 --> 00:35:45,175
i've got rocky and he's gonna throw

1048
00:35:45,175 --> 00:35:45,355
up

1049
00:35:47,125 --> 00:35:48,955
but um georgia would just leave her

1050
00:35:48,955 --> 00:35:50,845
food in the in the dish and

1051
00:35:50,845 --> 00:35:52,825
then we and we would go like

1052
00:35:52,825 --> 00:35:53,875
how can we get her to eat

1053
00:35:53,875 --> 00:35:55,195
more and we never figured it out

1054
00:35:55,225 --> 00:35:57,835
until we got molly and then the

1055
00:35:57,835 --> 00:36:01,645
competition between them like knowing that molly

1056
00:36:01,645 --> 00:36:03,415
will eat her food if she doesn't

1057
00:36:03,445 --> 00:36:06,325
eat it now they're like insane about

1058
00:36:06,955 --> 00:36:09,205
where georgia tries to like edge her

1059
00:36:09,205 --> 00:36:10,825
out and you know make sure she

1060
00:36:10,825 --> 00:36:12,115
doesn't need it that's like me i

00:38:02,215 --> 00:38:03,655
a different outfit and sit in a

1107
00:38:03,655 --> 00:38:05,035
chair yeah that's all he wants is

1108
00:38:05,035 --> 00:38:06,745
for him to be displayed because he

1109
00:38:06,745 --> 00:38:09,655
has he is a rare one of

1110
00:38:09,655 --> 00:38:11,815
a kind so this space collector has

1111
00:38:11,815 --> 00:38:13,255
all these things by the way they

1112
00:38:13,255 --> 00:38:14,305
always have any it came up in

1113
00:38:14,305 --> 00:38:16,915
your ah episode of deep space nine

1114
00:38:17,575 --> 00:38:19,345
he also had a baseball car what

1115
00:38:19,645 --> 00:38:21,355
does that obsession about here's the whole

1116
00:38:21,366 --> 00:38:22,315
episode i watched was all about

1117
00:38:22,375 --> 00:38:23,995
baseball card yes i am i'm a

1118
00:38:23,995 --> 00:38:26,905
big star trek fan um ah i've

1119
00:38:26,965 --> 00:38:28,165
i've liked it since i was a

1120
00:38:28,165 --> 00:38:30,865
kid but i will say and i'll

1121
00:38:30,865 --> 00:38:32,215
say this on the star trek podcast

1122
00:38:32,215 --> 00:38:34,465
that i caused with tawny newsome called

1123
00:38:34,825 --> 00:38:37,495
called ah star trek the pod directive

1124
00:38:37,945 --> 00:38:41,095
um that of all the sports that

1125
00:38:41,095 --> 00:38:42,505
would survive into

1126
00:38:42,505 --> 00:38:45,745
to the twenty fourth century would just

1127
00:38:45,745 --> 00:38:47,125
be not going to be baseball well

1128
00:38:47,185 --> 00:38:48,625
it's gonna be fucking soccer it's the

1129
00:38:48,625 --> 00:38:51,505
easiest played skee ball basketball will probably

1130
00:38:51,505 --> 00:38:53,458
survive too i also and that was

1131
00:38:53,458 --> 00:38:55,555
it being a family's that particular episode

1132
00:38:55,615 --> 00:38:57,325
was guilty of this i like when

1133
00:38:57,385 --> 00:39:00,775
when star trek talks about the great

1134
00:39:00,775 --> 00:39:02,515
whatever's of history so there

1135
00:39:02,695 --> 00:39:04,015
they always take us yeah they always

1136
00:39:04,015 --> 00:39:06,085
pick two of the most classic things

1137
00:39:06,085 --> 00:39:06,985
and then they come up with a

1138
00:39:06,985 --> 00:39:08,545
fake one yes so they're always like

1139
00:39:08,545 --> 00:39:12,115
shakespeare and mozart and sleep slop yes

1140
00:39:12,415 --> 00:39:15,745
so weird it's a classic construction well

1141
00:39:15,745 --> 00:39:18,595
because they have to acknowledge that yeah

1142
00:39:18,595 --> 00:39:18,771
they

1143
00:39:20,695 --> 00:39:21,865
but they can never say anything their

1144
00:39:21,865 --> 00:39:23,335
honor if they're in the twenty fourth

1145
00:39:23,335 --> 00:39:25,315
century why we can come up yeah

1146
00:39:25,315 --> 00:39:26,544
more things have come up yeah but

1147
00:39:26,544 --> 00:39:27,625
you know i have sleep but they

1148
00:39:27,625 --> 00:39:29,185
never say anything from the twentieth they

1149
00:39:29,185 --> 00:39:30,565
never want to take a stand on

1150
00:39:30,565 --> 00:39:32,935
like not even to do even elvis

1151
00:39:32,935 --> 00:39:35,035
or you know anything show you like

1152
00:39:35,035 --> 00:39:36,775
to me you're having never watched that

1153
00:39:37,555 --> 00:39:39,715
it felt like doogie howser or like

1154
00:39:40,345 --> 00:39:42,685
like it felt like it felt like

1155
00:39:43,495 --> 00:39:47,305
an old sitcom yeah looks but like

1156
00:39:47,605 --> 00:39:49,645
because there weren't as many single cam

1157
00:39:49,885 --> 00:39:51,595
sitcoms i feel like at that time

1158
00:39:51,595 --> 00:39:54,175
yeah it it has a feeling of

1159
00:39:54,175 --> 00:39:56,185
this was shot they shot it like

1160
00:39:56,185 --> 00:39:58,765
a a three camera they just shot

1161
00:39:58,765 --> 00:40:00,265
it with one camera does that make

1162
00:40:00,295 --> 00:40:02,125
sense like yeah that's that makes sense

1163
00:40:02,125 --> 00:40:03,625
of why it feels a certain way

1164
00:40:03,655 --> 00:40:04,915
yeah it's like all the plot is

1165
00:40:04,915 --> 00:40:07,315
absolutely it's an episode called in in

1166
00:40:07,315 --> 00:40:08,995
the lot on that one which i

1167
00:40:08,995 --> 00:40:10,675
was happy about yeah it was perfect

1168
00:40:10,675 --> 00:40:12,347
for me it was like a lot

1169
00:40:12,347 --> 00:40:14,065
and i like how like i wanna

1170
00:40:14,065 --> 00:40:15,175
get this baseball card to make my

1171
00:40:15,205 --> 00:40:17,395
dad happy and it was like what

1172
00:40:17,695 --> 00:40:19,795
it was so weird and like i

1173
00:40:19,795 --> 00:40:20,425

1174
00:40:20,455 --> 00:40:21,625

1182
00:40:33,355 --> 00:40:35,815

and you yell it here just glance

1404
00:48:05,580 --> 00:48:07,380
over here the worst thing for me

1405
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:09,330
is if janie enters the room when

1406
00:48:09,330 --> 00:48:11,520
i'm playing a video game i become

1407
00:48:12,090 --> 00:48:14,700
so self-conscious about it well because like

1408
00:48:14,970 --> 00:48:16,740
it's oh i talk over all that

1409
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:19,050
i will just talk over whatever is

1410
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:22,860
happening that's fine but i i feel

1411
00:48:22,860 --> 00:48:24,990
like i've been caught yeah because it's

1412
00:48:25,020 --> 00:48:27,180
infantile in a way yeah you feel

1413
00:48:27,210 --> 00:48:29,010
like it's yeah i see how it

1414
00:48:29,010 --> 00:48:30,810
looks yeah all of a sudden like

1415
00:48:30,810 --> 00:48:32,490
when i'm playing the game i'm in

1416
00:48:32,490 --> 00:48:33,900
the world of the game i'm following

1417
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:36,600
them right yeah and then um when

1418
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:38,070
somebody enters the room all of a

1419
00:48:38,070 --> 00:48:39,270
sudden it's like yeah i'm getting

1420
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:39,810
in a bug

1421
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:44,190
i feel like i don't judge it

1422
00:48:44,190 --> 00:48:44,730
at all

1423
00:48:45,630 --> 00:48:47,010
but i think partly it's because i

1424
00:48:47,010 --> 00:48:48,480
grew up just like with my brother

1425
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:50,310
always playing video games my brother my

1426
00:48:50,310 --> 00:48:51,720
dad always watching basketball all these things

1427
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:52,740
i don't really care about but they're

1428
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:56,220
around she doesn't just it's it's entirely

1429
00:48:56,250 --> 00:48:59,220
retired early internal here's to your point

1430
00:48:59,220 --> 00:49:01,740
lauren about talking over movies and you

1431
00:49:01,740 --> 00:49:03,210
just wandering in and talking over me

1432
00:49:03,420 --> 00:49:04,410
i think there need to be some

1433
00:49:04,410 --> 00:49:05,490
rules established

1434
00:49:05,490 --> 00:49:07,710
as of when people can talk over

1435
00:49:07,710 --> 00:49:10,470
tel i think that is congress i

1436
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:12,720
yes i think that someone should give

1437
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:13,920
you a heads up of hey i

1438
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:16,230
want to have a conversation okay instead

1439
00:49:16,230 --> 00:49:18,060
of just coming in and saying this

1440
00:49:18,060 --> 00:49:19,590
is what club does so when do

1441
00:49:19,590 --> 00:49:21,000
you blob like that all the time

1442
00:49:21,060 --> 00:49:24,060

1443
00:49:24,060 --> 00:49:25,620

00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:26,550

00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:30,330
don't even wait for a pause in

1447
00:49:30,330 --> 00:49:31,380
it for it to be silenced or

1448
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:32,940
whatever they just talk over the dialogue

1449
00:49:33,180 --> 00:49:34,770
it then makes me instead of you

to you you know what i hate

1453
00:49:40,890 --> 00:49:43,860
is when you're watching tv live and

1454
00:49:43,860 --> 00:49:45,690
there's commercials phuket will do

1455
00:49:46,470 --> 00:49:48,420

1462
00:50:01,230 --> 00:50:03,900
like a third person speaking randomly die

1463
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:04,800

um she says she had a shed

1499
00:51:25,925 --> 00:51:28,025
like a modern remote that didn't make

1500
00:51:28,025 --> 00:51:29,735
noise when you when you press the

1501
00:51:29,735 --> 00:51:33,329
button and everything soft-touch and a commercial

1502
00:51:33,395 --> 00:51:35,705
commercial came on and she muted which

1503
00:51:35,756 --> 00:51:37,325
community said i don't have to listen

1504
00:51:37,325 --> 00:51:39,875
to that wow suddenly you know what

1505
00:51:39,875 --> 00:51:42,395
suddenly you don't like she made it

1506
00:51:42,455 --> 00:51:43,355
a feeling of power

1507
00:51:43,355 --> 00:51:45,515
power yeah and now anytime i mean

1508
00:51:45,965 --> 00:51:47,837
it's any medium virtual like i don't

1509
00:51:48,077 --> 00:51:49,985
listen to that it feels amazing when

1510
00:51:49,985 --> 00:51:51,215
you meet the commercials and you just

1511
00:51:51,215 --> 00:51:52,415
like sit there in the silence you're

1512
00:51:52,415 --> 00:51:55,625
like ah yeah when i first got

1513
00:51:55,625 --> 00:51:57,065
my first tivo it was such a

1514
00:51:57,065 --> 00:51:59,285
feeling of power to to figure out

1515
00:51:59,285 --> 00:52:02,435
exactly like how yeah how many to

1516
00:52:02,435 --> 00:52:03,515
press exec

1517
00:52:03,815 --> 00:52:06,425
when depress play again it was so

1518
00:52:06,425 --> 00:52:10,415
satisfying but conversely it always feels like

1519
00:52:10,505 --> 00:52:14,105
a a defeat when either you go

1520
00:52:14,105 --> 00:52:16,655
too far or you absolutely have to

1521
00:52:16,655 --> 00:52:18,455
hear the very last piece of any

1522
00:52:18,485 --> 00:52:20,465
absolutely yeah but man when you could

1523
00:52:20,465 --> 00:52:22,235
get that damage what exactly was so

1524
00:52:22,235 --> 00:52:23,675
good out of god i missed hva

1525
00:52:23,765 --> 00:52:25,415
well i've started to lift the t

1526
00:52:25,415 --> 00:52:27,695
and g episodes because they're on paramount

1527
00:52:27,695 --> 00:52:30,575

1528
00:52:30,575 --> 00:52:33,485

1530
00:52:35,345 --> 00:52:37,205
to fast forward them now and i

1531
00:52:37,205 --> 00:52:39,575
tried to time it exactly so that

1532
00:52:39,575 --> 00:52:41,345
like right when you see jean created

1533
00:52:41,345 --> 00:52:43,565

which is a great movie and i

1585
00:54:26,615 --> 00:54:29,585

00:54:29,585 --> 00:54:34,325
holiday wow xi in roman holiday it's

1587
00:54:34,325 --> 00:54:36,125
a princess who decides to act like

1588
00:54:36,125 --> 00:54:37,595
a normal person and then goes back

1589
00:54:37,595 --> 00:54:38,735
to being a princess at the end

1590
00:54:38,855 --> 00:54:40,565
spoiler and

1591
00:54:40,985 --> 00:54:43,055
megan markle is not a princess who

1592
00:54:43,055 --> 00:54:44,375
acts like a princess and goes back

1593
00:54:44,375 --> 00:54:45,455
to not being a princess at the

1594
00:54:45,455 --> 00:54:47,705

00:55:00,695 --> 00:55:00,935
show

1601
00:55:01,115 --> 00:55:01,745
better deal

1602
00:55:03,095 --> 00:55:05,465
that's really the couple and that they

1603
00:55:05,495 --> 00:55:07,355
kind of had to it just seemed

1604
00:55:07,355 --> 00:55:09,185
like they had to get out if

1605
00:55:09,185 --> 00:55:10,985
you watch today or bring up and

1606
00:55:10,985 --> 00:55:12,335
i know i could've just watched it

1607
00:55:12,485 --> 00:55:14,075
chan would have answered this but did

1608
00:55:14,075 --> 00:55:15,635
they ever did oprah ever say like

1609
00:55:16,175 --> 00:55:18,245
well when you first started dating him

1610
00:55:18,245 --> 00:55:20,465
though wasn't it attractive to you of

1611
00:55:20,495 --> 00:55:22,955
the whole princess di she did as

1612
00:55:22,955 --> 00:55:24,213
ask that she was like well what

1613
00:55:24,213 --> 00:55:25,895
didn't you think about what it would

1614
00:55:25,895 --> 00:55:27,215
be like to marry prince and she

1615
00:55:27,215 --> 00:55:30,515
said no she's achieving she made time

1616
00:55:31,145 --> 00:55:32,554
to clarify i wish that she had

1617
00:55:32,554 --> 00:55:34,355
asked like but wasn't that exciting to

1618
00:55:34,355 --> 00:55:35,465
you that he was a prince and

1619
00:55:35,465 --> 00:55:36,665
using that part of the reason why

1620
00:55:36,665 --> 00:55:37,745
you agreed to date him in the

1621
00:55:37,745 --> 00:55:39,515
first place she i don't think she

1622
00:55:39,515 --> 00:55:40,895
did phrase it like that but she

1623
00:55:41,285 --> 00:55:43,115
meghan markle said she did not goo

1624
00:55:43,115 --> 00:55:44,735
google him at all which i'm like

1625
00:55:45,335 --> 00:55:46,505
and she didn't grow up knowing about

1626
00:55:46,505 --> 00:55:48,035
him i feel like my whole life

1627
00:55:48,035 --> 00:55:50,225
i thought about these people yeah for

1628
00:55:50,225 --> 00:55:52,235
sure i probably didn't even know who

1629
00:55:52,235 --> 00:55:54,155
he was until he did get engaged

1630
00:55:54,215 --> 00:55:55,655
oh okay i was very aware of

1631
00:55:55,655 --> 00:55:57,425
him when we're friends with princess di

1632
00:55:57,425 --> 00:55:58,595
ma of course i did shake her

1633
00:55:58,595 --> 00:56:01,175
hand but i also am like his

1634
00:56:01,175 --> 00:56:02,495
age and so it's like you know

1635
00:56:02,495 --> 00:56:03,275
seeing why

1636
00:56:03,275 --> 00:56:05,225
whenever there were flowers of god i

1637
00:56:05,255 --> 00:56:07,235
could have been you could have married

1638
00:56:07,235 --> 00:56:08,615
him well that's what kind of killed

1639
00:56:08,615 --> 00:56:10,625
me about this whole thing because my

1640
00:56:10,655 --> 00:56:14,285
homie he's marrying second banana airs on

1641
00:56:14,285 --> 00:56:17,375
tv so i'm not you i know

1642
00:56:17,435 --> 00:56:19,025
well i actually had this thought when

1643
00:56:19,025 --> 00:56:20,465
this was happening because i was like

1644
00:56:20,675 --> 00:56:22,325
my whole life i just assumed there's

1645
00:56:22,325 --> 00:56:23,435
no chance i'd ever marry

1646
00:56:23,435 --> 00:56:26,045

1651
00:56:38,735 --> 00:56:40,685
poised in a situation like that i'd

1652
00:56:40,685 --> 00:56:43,055

1653
00:56:43,055 --> 00:56:43,835

00:59:47,225 --> 00:59:49,745
because okay so on each turn we

1744
00:59:49,745 --> 00:59:51,515
go around in a circle and each

1745
00:59:51,515 --> 00:59:55,235
person names a person a famous purser

1746
00:59:55,235 --> 00:59:56,075
i guess a person we know

1747
00:59:56,075 --> 00:59:56,225
no

1748
00:59:57,395 --> 00:59:59,675
same thing when you're up so i

1749
00:59:59,675 --> 01:00:03,095
mean and the category that they fall

1750
01:00:03,095 --> 01:00:07,325
under okay meaning singer actor meaning that

1751
01:00:07,325 --> 01:00:10,205
yes so so name yes and you

1752
01:00:10,205 --> 01:00:13,265
say it as in no more this

1753
01:00:13,295 --> 01:00:16,055
so for instance kanye west no more

1754
01:00:16,055 --> 01:00:16,805
rappers

1755
01:00:17,675 --> 01:00:19,685
and then what then we cannot name

1756
01:00:19,685 --> 01:00:22,415
any rapper ever again okay so then

1757
01:00:22,415 --> 01:00:24,035
you can name anyone else you want

1758
01:00:24,035 --> 01:00:25,595
and pick a category that they fall

1759
01:00:25,595 --> 01:00:28,325
under and say no more this and

1760
01:00:28,325 --> 01:00:30,845
then ok eventually we will run out

1761
01:00:30,845 --> 01:00:33,305
of people oh okay so eventually or

1762
01:00:33,305 --> 01:00:37,506
almost immediately time each time like oh

1763
01:00:37,595 --> 01:00:39,005
say no more whatever then you name

1764
01:00:39,005 --> 01:00:40,415
a person name whatever so yeah and

1765
01:00:40,415 --> 01:00:42,035
that narrows down has done okay yeah

1766
01:00:42,035 --> 01:00:43,595
it is like she's good to start

1767
01:00:43,595 --> 01:00:45,815
with a more obscure group not now

1768
01:00:45,815 --> 01:00:48,215
yes so you can't like if you

1769
01:00:48,215 --> 01:00:50,105
were to say like no more men

1770
01:00:50,375 --> 01:00:52,265
