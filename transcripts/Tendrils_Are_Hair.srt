by her where we were

69
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,800
she pulled out her face and took

70
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:05,310
up with some clowns she she cried

71
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,830
the day the circus got there not

73
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,714
of joy okay but she was a

74
00:03:12,714 --> 00:03:13,740
little bit too but the next line

75
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:15,840
is just she was sad about it

76
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:18,120
right what did you say lauren then

77
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,130
she's tired of the world passionate

78
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:22,140
the world passing versa so she painted

79
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:23,790
up a face and took off with

80
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:27,270
some clowns took on the sounds of

81
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:30,180
the down up on oh why oh

82
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:32,610
but vivid

83
00:03:33,883 --> 00:03:37,740
a where i first heard that song

84
00:03:38,228 --> 00:03:40,590
was on american idol sung by diane

85
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:43,890

86
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,140
garde de carmo thank you to giorno

87
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,560
and delivery it's still live diana delivery

88
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:52,200
yeah but anyway yeah definitely that was

89
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,460
her stage name and it's actually a

90
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:54,000
good stage

91
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,190
ha okay it's not going to be

92
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:58,440
delivery it wouldn't make any sense

93
00:03:59,649 --> 00:04:01,680
you think he would get it i

94
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,160

95
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:04,440

96
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,300
saying it that i downloaded it at

97
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,700
the time and that's an amazing herb

98
00:04:09,129 --> 00:04:11,820
or is a little random that they

113
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,420
sorry it's not a funny rendition it

114
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:46,830
is really a video it's an episode

115
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:47,490
of a tv show

116
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:50,400
okay so there's what do you what

117
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,350
do you call youtube videos any any

118
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:53,850
clip on youtube you call it episode

119
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:55,170
of the you call it exactly what

120
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:57,300
it is this is an excerpt from

121
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,710
a movie it's not really i mean

122
00:04:58,710 --> 00:04:59,970
when what do you say someone sent

123
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:02,670
me a funny video like implies something

124
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:04,800
someone taped or so you know you

125
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,780
know suddenly just something someone made

126
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:09,690
and it applies that immediately or like

127
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:12,780
way away into the sentence and at

128
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,610
least as long into the sentences when

129
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:15,300
i interrupted you

130
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:16,650
okay

131
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:19,740
i would show anyway video someone so

132
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:21,570
i started with faulty premise i retract

133
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:23,850
my statement someone sent you a clip

134
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:25,800
from an episode of the tv show

135
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:28,740
you know what the muppet show that's

136
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:30,900
correct and what happened oh

137
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,980
she you did want to know now

138
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:37,530
i'm interested now you've hooked me see

139
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:39,540
now you got your claws into me

140
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:43,110
they did the she performed the song

141
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:46,920
ah and they sort of acted out

142
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:49,140
behind her there is a little muppet

143
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:51,750
on a highwire and then there are

144
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:52,080
three

145
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,860
three full like people that are wearing

146
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,280
clown outfits and sort of mudpie masks

147
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:02,790
and it's a little disconcerting because they

148
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:05,730
do look like muppets do you think

149
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:07,770
they'll do learn to walk like they

150
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:09,780
should do like current muppet show and

151
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:11,400
then they have i'm sorry lauren will

152
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,210
you will you hold

153
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:12,690
my moment

154
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:14,940
are you one of the impression that

155
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:16,770
none of the muppets can walk know

156
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:20,220
they'll slither kermit has feet and legs

157
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:24,360
one sees one proficient at karate he

158
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,440
has them in one scene and one

159
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,820
movie but so you have no he

160
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:29,310
doesn't know you know like carbon and

161
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:31,500
you think that his feet and legs

162
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:34,830
way yes when you don't see i'm

163
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:36,450
not seeing them they're gone

164
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:38,820
are they here to tell me the

165
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:40,770
truth mar they there will i'm not

166
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:43,680
saying they're not right are they what

167
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:46,590
are kermit slaves you see something does

168
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:48,240
not mean that it does not exist

169
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,160
but tell the truth they do not

170
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,540
exist when i'm not seeing them as

171
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:53,070
that we we don't know that this

172
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:55,020
is schrodinger's kirby like you think that

173
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,970
jim henson is down there with his

174
00:06:56,970 --> 00:06:57,120
hat

00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,950
end up passed on so no i

176
00:06:58,950 --> 00:06:59,820
don't think that at all

177
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:02,730
and you but you think that the

178
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:04,560
legs are just dangling

179
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:08,070
it's not whether or not either of

180
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:09,960
us thinks that he cuts out we

181
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:13,560
cannot week he cuts them off this

182
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,760
is absurd

183
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:16,680

yes i do yeah cool with with

189
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:35,550
the with the complete original lyrics yeah

190
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:38,340
yeah absolutely i believe that the the

191
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:41,160
radio edit is is not good enough

192
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:43,320
yeah because it's wet and gushy right

193
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,210
it's like what's the kidz bop version

194
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:47,190
gonna be oh boy yeah i know

195
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:48,420
they really they really do need to

196
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:50,400
figure that out yeah i guess

197
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,470
i would say they really do need

198
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:53,250
to figure that out

199
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:57,240
um dry and pushy

200
00:07:59,190 --> 00:07:59,940
absolutely

201
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:02,580
the concept of dryness is not threatening

202
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:04,170
to kids at all no but i

203
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:05,760
mean and a dry civic sense of

204
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,260
humour this is like you know describe

205
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:09,480

218
00:08:35,670 --> 00:08:35,760
out

219
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:37,320

would say that yeah okay alright

226
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,660
if between two ferns as paul's movie

227
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:57,120
than comedy shows my show stands to

228
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,610
reason yeah and curb your enthusiasm is

229

232
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,950
yeah i watched one and he came

233
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:09,240
out and i think i feel like

234
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,500
john lennon was on it or something

235
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,970
he was like a big monumental show

236
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,710
and he came out and he did

237
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:15,960
a monologue and he ate shit so

238
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:18,030
badly that i was like how does

239
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:19,710
this guy have a job yeah and

240
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:21,060
it seemed like it was a regular

241
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,100
occurrence of him coming out saying a

242
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,390
couple of jokes that no one would

243
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:26,430
laugh at and him going oh i

244
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:28,470
don't know and then moving on to

245
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:29,880
an interview which he didn't do well

246
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:31,890

247
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:32,160

248
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,780
one i saw in that five years

249
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:37,380

255
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:52,320
so calm

256
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:55,800
and ah smart in in replying to

257
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,360
everything that he's saying like not taking

258
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,760
the bait of anything um and it's

259
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,560
amazing also considering the table is out

260
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,649
of his mind on cocaine at the

261
00:10:02,649 --> 00:10:03,000
time

262
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:06,000
still is able to just be like

263
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:07,590
yeah i get i get what you're

264
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:09,390

00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,790
you're not you're aware has a better

269
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:20,970
effect yeah i don't know it is

270
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:22,560
interesting like the tom snyder's and all

271
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,820
the people who used to be able

272
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:24,570
to have like

273
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,900
broadcast careers doing bad interviews

274
00:10:29,173 --> 00:10:30,360
no i mean tom snyder was good

275
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,500
but again you know what i mean

276
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:34,800
like like with everything in entertainment i

277
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,290
was so accustomed to like you watch

278
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:38,880
old s and l episodes and they

279
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,440
truly leave it up to the audience

280
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,000
whether to laugh or nodded stuff and

281
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,530
people will eat shit whereas now you

282
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:44,460
go to the show and they pump

283
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:46,800
the applause sign you know all the

284
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,360
time and they they try to get

285
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,140
you to laugh after

286
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:51,540
every joke and applaud every single entrance

287
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:53,490
of anyone it used to be like

288
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:55,500
tv was so interesting because people could

289
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,360
just sit there and have like a

290
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,420
non interesting conversation and that's like reductive

291
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:01,800
of of some of the old shows

292
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,480
but i mean there could be a

293
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:06,060
whole hour long conversation and ten minutes

294
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:07,980
of it could not work or not

295
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:09,166
be interesting yeah yeah

296
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:11,100
you know i miss that it's a

297
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,570
lot more to show we're doing here

298
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:16,170

300
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,220
of an audience just somehow knew that

301
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:24,750
they were on the same page and

302
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:28,560
refused to acknowledge the applause without talking

303
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,460
to be interesting yeah

304
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:30,810
without talking to each other but just

305
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:32,370

324
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,710
norms were different i remember an episode

00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:06,270
of the sixties dating game that i

326
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:08,040

00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,820
you get it like how did he

421
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:30,930
go around and give it to people

422
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,940
or later know we we got a

423
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:34,440
hold of it because of just because

424
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,460
of being in show business

425
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:37,410

that was like look at this dork

429
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:44,430

430
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:46,140
go to it would go to event

431
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:48,240

432
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,020
an event you say i need a

433
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:51,090
singer they'd say oh we have this

if something like that was uploaded to

stabbed

886
00:32:18,095 --> 00:32:20,255
just take place this is like how

887
00:32:20,255 --> 00:32:20,975
jackass started

888
00:32:22,205 --> 00:32:23,435
what if the three of us did

889
00:32:23,435 --> 00:32:25,985
a competitor jackass show

890
00:32:27,215 --> 00:32:28,955
oh i think definitely this time for

891
00:32:28,955 --> 00:32:29,495
us to do that

892
00:32:31,085 --> 00:32:32,735
in our lives i think we're three

893
00:32:32,735 --> 00:32:33,782
of us the three of us are

894
00:32:33,787 --> 00:32:36,035
the perfect point in our lives it's

895
00:32:36,195 --> 00:32:39,665
mutilating ourselves always seem like i do

896
00:32:39,695 --> 00:32:41,735
think jackass was funny like oh i

897
00:32:41,735 --> 00:32:42,965
thought so what but what if we

898
00:32:42,965 --> 00:32:45,125
did a jackass type show that was

899
00:32:45,125 --> 00:32:46,955
trying to compete with jackass but we

900
00:32:47,015 --> 00:32:48,815
got too scared before every single thing

901
00:32:48,815 --> 00:32:50,165
we never did any of the things

902
00:32:50,585 --> 00:32:52,595
yeah that's a good idea that's good

903
00:32:52,595 --> 00:32:53,645
and everyone would just see us being

904
00:32:53,645 --> 00:32:55,145
scared and we never actually do the

905
00:32:55,145 --> 00:32:56,075
things yeah

906
00:32:56,555 --> 00:32:57,875
it's fun but we always feel like

907
00:32:58,205 --> 00:32:59,615
i don't want to everyone could see

908
00:32:59,615 --> 00:33:02,315
us being scared like heads that is

909
00:33:02,315 --> 00:33:04,025
really the draw that's the drug is

910
00:33:04,385 --> 00:33:06,815
yeah it's just look at east cowards

911
00:33:08,015 --> 00:33:10,205
what would be a challenge that we

912
00:33:10,205 --> 00:33:11,915
wouldn't want to do like attaching something

913
00:33:11,915 --> 00:33:15,125
to our nuts yeah we could we

914
00:33:15,125 --> 00:33:17,375
could clip something to your nuts lorne

915
00:33:17,375 --> 00:33:19,925
and we could like like electrodes or

916
00:33:19,925 --> 00:33:20,495
something

917
00:33:21,845 --> 00:33:24,005
yeah like this and yeah you do

918
00:33:24,005 --> 00:33:28,865
like um pregnancy labor pains electrodes attached

919
00:33:28,865 --> 00:33:31,325
to your nuts yeah yeah we would

920
00:33:31,325 --> 00:33:33,485
do those we would do pregnancy labour

921
00:33:33,695 --> 00:33:35,795
yeah we go boys like roads yeah

922
00:33:36,215 --> 00:33:38,585
those attention to our nuts general labor

923
00:33:38,585 --> 00:33:39,245
pain electrodes

924
00:33:40,865 --> 00:33:43,265

us for our appearance fee well sure

948
00:34:24,875 --> 00:34:26,495
there'd be a sag-aftra minimum yeah of

949
00:34:26,495 --> 00:34:29,675
course yeah that's understood of course my

950
00:34:29,675 --> 00:34:31,565
answer any preacher that in the yeah

951
00:34:31,595 --> 00:34:34,385
in the acting labour wires ancestors

952
00:34:35,735 --> 00:34:37,865
yeah but after but each time were

953
00:34:37,895 --> 00:34:38,975
we just kind of like take a

954
00:34:38,975 --> 00:34:40,625
look at it and go okay what

955
00:34:40,625 --> 00:34:42,155
are we getting paid for this like

956
00:34:42,215 --> 00:34:43,835
i would imagine we would get ah

957
00:34:44,585 --> 00:34:46,355
probably like twenty grand an episode a

958
00:34:46,362 --> 00:34:47,885
piece to to be in the show

959
00:34:47,885 --> 00:34:49,265
right and so it is like what

960
00:34:49,265 --> 00:34:52,145
is honestly the mildest stunt that you

961
00:34:52,145 --> 00:34:53,975
could think of that you would actually

962
00:34:53,975 --> 00:34:55,505
do yeah i would maybe do something

963
00:34:55,505 --> 00:34:55,775
on why

964
00:34:55,775 --> 00:34:59,135
water and also lauren um okay i

965
00:34:59,135 --> 00:35:00,845
guess i would do something like

966
00:35:02,045 --> 00:35:04,805
like with hot sauce and my taint

967
00:35:06,185 --> 00:35:10,415
on your nuts my taint um i

968
00:35:10,985 --> 00:35:11,735
i you know

969
00:35:13,745 --> 00:35:15,455
to that over the weekend two things

970
00:35:15,455 --> 00:35:18,185
happen like a daredevil number one a

971
00:35:18,342 --> 00:35:20,945
a daredevil die attempting a stunt and

972
00:35:20,945 --> 00:35:22,505
then it's like real yeah i didn't

973
00:35:22,505 --> 00:35:23,855

974
00:35:23,855 --> 00:35:26,255
people dare devil die and no one

975
00:35:26,255 --> 00:35:29,645
told me and dare the devil don't

976
00:35:29,705 --> 00:35:32,165
think people know he died jumping out

977
00:35:32,195 --> 00:35:32,975
here are some

978
00:35:32,975 --> 00:35:34,775
nothing and it was kinda like oh

979
00:35:34,805 --> 00:35:36,395
yeah well no one should ever do

980
00:35:36,395 --> 00:35:38,735
those things ever so yeah oh my

981
00:35:38,735 --> 00:35:39,935
god i hate when people jump from

982
00:35:39,935 --> 00:35:42,125
building to building for foe what do

983
00:35:42,125 --> 00:35:43,805
they call that sugar score

984
00:35:46,715 --> 00:35:48,575
um yeah i mean i don't think

985
00:35:48,575 --> 00:35:50,285
i would do okay so i would

986
00:35:50,315 --> 00:35:52,025
i would jump in a pool probably

987
00:35:52,445 --> 00:35:54,725
that's not a shot pool with my

988
00:35:54,725 --> 00:35:57,635
clothes on i'd do my phone in

989
00:35:57,635 --> 00:36:03,335
my pocket i watch ah jump in

990
00:36:03,335 --> 00:36:05,135
a pool i dare you to

991
00:36:05,135 --> 00:36:06,845
jump in the pool we used to

992
00:36:06,845 --> 00:36:09,485
i mean i was home and i

993
00:36:09,485 --> 00:36:10,535
were talking about this the other day

994
00:36:10,535 --> 00:36:12,095
we it's true lord we were we

995
00:36:12,095 --> 00:36:14,225
used to ride bikes into the pool

996
00:36:14,255 --> 00:36:16,805
tall john and i yes um and

997
00:36:16,805 --> 00:36:20,105
that was when back in my twenties

998
00:36:20,105 --> 00:36:21,965
in our twenty wow your wild we

999
00:36:21,965 --> 00:36:24,560
would we would try to use the

1000
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:25,265
the key

1001
00:36:25,325 --> 00:36:27,605
was you would try to like pull

1002
00:36:27,605 --> 00:36:28,865
up on the handlebars right as you

1003
00:36:28,865 --> 00:36:30,305
got on the edge so that because

1004
00:36:30,485 --> 00:36:32,105
what we found is if you just

1005
00:36:32,105 --> 00:36:33,845
wrote it into the pool it would

1006
00:36:33,845 --> 00:36:35,945
two-fold first you go face first but

1007
00:36:35,945 --> 00:36:37,205
so we would try to like jump

1008
00:36:37,205 --> 00:36:38,945
it into the pool and then today's

1009
00:36:38,945 --> 00:36:41,135
first is funnier face first was fun

1010
00:36:41,135 --> 00:36:43,055
though but then tell john would also

1011
00:36:43,085 --> 00:36:44,345
jump from the top of the roof

1012
00:36:44,345 --> 00:36:45,425
into the pool yeah that's

1013
00:36:45,485 --> 00:36:46,925
inside she gets a bike out but

1014
00:36:46,925 --> 00:36:48,065
that's crazy how do we get the

1015
00:36:48,065 --> 00:36:49,865
bike out we picked it up it

1016
00:36:49,865 --> 00:36:51,005
didn't sink to the bottom

1017
00:36:52,325 --> 00:36:54,125
sure this is to

1018
00:36:54,575 --> 00:36:56,435
he would pick it up i can't

1019
00:36:56,435 --> 00:36:57,485
argue with you it did sink to

1020
00:36:57,485 --> 00:36:59,165
the bottom it sounds hard to get

1021
00:36:59,165 --> 00:37:00,905
it out boy he jumped from the

1022
00:37:00,905 --> 00:37:02,315
roof does sound hard to get a

1023
00:37:02,315 --> 00:37:03,815
bike like if you because you're going

1024
00:37:03,815 --> 00:37:05,765
in the deep end presumably right deep

1025
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:08,285
ish yeah like midpoint okay so you

1026
00:37:08,285 --> 00:37:09,965
could you could drag it you could

1027
00:37:09,965 --> 00:37:11,676
stab drag you didn't drag and drop

1028
00:37:11,676 --> 00:37:12,995
whim it up to the surface that's

1029
00:37:12,995 --> 00:37:14,735
what i'm saying wait so what

1030
00:37:14,765 --> 00:37:16,295
what roof is he doing this half

1031
00:37:16,295 --> 00:37:18,245
of this was brian hussein's house so

1032
00:37:18,245 --> 00:37:20,195
he would he would take a run

1033
00:37:20,195 --> 00:37:21,725
off of it so imagine that roof

1034
00:37:21,905 --> 00:37:23,735
yeah i actually did baby so he's

1035
00:37:23,779 --> 00:37:26,225
him constantly for his child and also

1036
00:37:26,225 --> 00:37:27,665
you've maybe been in that place i

1037
00:37:27,695 --> 00:37:30,455
probably know someone i wonder because it

1038
00:37:30,455 --> 00:37:32,375
did he did dave rath live there

1039
00:37:33,125 --> 00:37:34,865

1044
00:37:43,055 --> 00:37:44,765
never employed a babysitter and i've never

1045
00:37:44,765 --> 00:37:46,745
been a babysitter well i got paid

1046
00:37:46,745 --> 00:37:49,445
fifteen dollars an hour um and that

1047
00:37:49,445 --> 00:37:50,825
was i think that's the most i

1048
00:37:50,825 --> 00:37:52,325
ever got but i knew people who

1049
00:37:52,325 --> 00:37:54,635
are making twenty or twenty five wow

1050
00:37:54,665 --> 00:37:55,055
um

1051
00:37:55,055 --> 00:37:58,085
i'm in new york especially but yeah

1052
00:37:58,085 --> 00:37:59,555
it was usually fifteen an hour but

1053
00:37:59,555 --> 00:38:01,025
i don't know that that's people's rate

1054
00:38:01,025 --> 00:38:03,305
nowadays in big cities i think it's

1055
00:38:03,305 --> 00:38:05,525
probably pretty low for my famously got

1056
00:38:05,525 --> 00:38:06,875
one dollar an hour to do it

1057
00:38:07,565 --> 00:38:10,415
wow everyone knows that so we just

1058
00:38:10,415 --> 00:38:12,125
have to babysit your little sister know

1059
00:38:12,125 --> 00:38:14,645
to baby sit up friends daughter and

1060
00:38:14,645 --> 00:38:15,215
son this was

1061
00:38:15,245 --> 00:38:18,485
recently ah no look if you like

1062
00:38:19,865 --> 00:38:22,415
no when i was like fourteen maybe

1063
00:38:22,415 --> 00:38:24,815
i have a vivid memory of reading

1064
00:38:24,815 --> 00:38:27,245
the ah the latest issue of ah

1065
00:38:27,845 --> 00:38:30,185
bilson cabbages new mutants when i was

1066
00:38:30,185 --> 00:38:33,365
doing this but um i was i

1067
00:38:33,365 --> 00:38:34,895
was i would watch them and the

1068
00:38:35,375 --> 00:38:36,785
the one girl would throw the cat

1069
00:38:36,785 --> 00:38:38,075
on me which is how i developed

1070
00:38:38,075 --> 00:38:39,125
a fear of cats

1071
00:38:39,755 --> 00:38:42,845
and ah and then i would only

1072
00:38:42,875 --> 00:38:44,675
pay that fear yeah sort of i

1073
00:38:44,675 --> 00:38:47,165
don't really like hats and i'm really

1074
00:38:47,165 --> 00:38:48,515
allergic to them so that doesn't help

1075
00:38:48,515 --> 00:38:51,095
but um but ah and so then

1076
00:38:51,095 --> 00:38:52,835
and i would complain i'd be like

1077
00:38:52,835 --> 00:38:54,305
i'm only getting a dollar an hour

1078
00:38:54,305 --> 00:38:55,205
so it would be like at the

1079
00:38:55,205 --> 00:38:56,105
end of the night they'd give me

1080
00:38:56,105 --> 00:38:58,085
like three dollars or four dollars it

1081
00:38:58,085 --> 00:38:59,855
is ridiculous that they

1082
00:39:00,065 --> 00:39:03,575
take care to protect your children yeah

1083
00:39:03,605 --> 00:39:05,555

1084
00:39:05,555 --> 00:39:06,845

1108
00:40:10,775 --> 00:40:13,745
your bike rides close right side glasses

1109
00:40:14,315 --> 00:40:15,785
what is something that you did as

1110
00:40:15,785 --> 00:40:17,375
a kid that you would never do

1111
00:40:17,375 --> 00:40:19,685
now and lauren same question okay i

1112
00:40:19,685 --> 00:40:21,965
would that i that is like out

1113
00:40:21,965 --> 00:40:23,585
of fashion now no no no

1114
00:40:24,250 --> 00:40:25,540
of doing it would be like what

1115
00:40:25,570 --> 00:40:29,463
no oh you can't do that well

1116
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:32,350
oh man that does remind me that

1117
00:40:32,350 --> 00:40:33,640
my dad and i yesterday were talking

1118
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:36,400
about how weird it was that dog

1119
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,110
shit everywhere no one ever picked it

1120
00:40:38,110 --> 00:40:41,650
up um back in the day true

1121
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,750
yeah they would just run away and

1122
00:40:43,750 --> 00:40:44,410
they would yeah

1123
00:40:44,590 --> 00:40:46,240
and no one ever thought about because

1124
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:48,070
it was like oh it'll just crumble

1125
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:49,450
and fertilize the grass

1126
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:52,630
um so there was just dog shit

1127
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:55,210
everywhere yeah um in the seventies and

1128
00:40:55,210 --> 00:40:56,950
early eighties okay so that was a

1129
00:40:56,950 --> 00:40:58,570
thing that off would often happen was

1130
00:40:58,570 --> 00:41:00,520
that you stood up in touch yeah

1131
00:41:00,550 --> 00:41:03,640
you would step back then it's true

1132
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,060
and i think it's like harvin annoyed

1133
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:08,980
probably isn't he like the guy who

1134
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:10,600
kind of you know that was his

1135
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:12,550
whole platform his whole thing was how

1136
00:41:12,550 --> 00:41:14,470
we started toys a killing up cleaning

1137
00:41:14,470 --> 00:41:17,020
up san francisco and dodman dog show

1138
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:19,390
too powerful and they just shit on

1139
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:19,450
it

1140
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:23,650
um i mean is there stuff that

1141
00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:24,790
i used to do that i wouldn't

1142
00:41:24,790 --> 00:41:26,440
do now i mean i was thinking

1143
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:27,820
about how i never locked my bike

1144
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:29,530
up but you're talking about like something

1145
00:41:29,530 --> 00:41:32,380
physical i guess anything i tell you

1146
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:34,300
what here's maybe a more interesting question

1147
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:35,710
because i think that is obviously there's

1148
00:41:35,710 --> 00:41:36,970
a bunch of shit you wouldn't do

1149
00:41:37,090 --> 00:41:37,849
that you did as a kid you

1150
00:41:37,849 --> 00:41:39,220
would do now what is something that

1151
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:40,570
you did as a kid that you

1152
00:41:40,604 --> 00:41:41,740
wish you could do now

1153
00:41:43,810 --> 00:41:45,190

1203
00:43:32,098 --> 00:43:33,550
i've thought about that and you know

1204
00:43:33,550 --> 00:43:34,270
my friend had

1205
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:36,640
my friend had a really fun bachelor

1206
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:39,760
party up in ohi where essentially it

1207
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:41,410
was like where the bionic woman lived

1208
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:43,600
that's right where it was three days

1209
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:46,360
and everyone was like playing pool games

1210
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:47,830
and there was a basketball court and

1211
00:43:47,830 --> 00:43:49,060
i'll start all sorts of stuff and

1212
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:50,500
i was like and it was like

1213
00:43:50,590 --> 00:43:53,170
every guy you knew and i was

1214
00:43:53,170 --> 00:43:54,640
saying like why do we why do

1215
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:54,730
we

1216
00:43:54,730 --> 00:43:55,660
have to wait for someone to get

1217
00:43:55,660 --> 00:43:56,770
married to do this why can't we

1218
00:43:56,770 --> 00:43:58,840
just do this like every summer will

1219
00:43:58,930 --> 00:44:01,090
yeah no girls allowed absolutely but but

1220
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:02,620
it seems like no one will make

1221
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:03,910
the time to do it unless it's

1222
00:44:03,910 --> 00:44:05,590
for an official occasion like if i

1223
00:44:05,590 --> 00:44:06,700
were to send out an email of

1224
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:08,740
like ok we're all getting together ah

1225
00:44:08,740 --> 00:44:10,300
you know i don't know men's retreat

1226
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:12,010

00:44:12,010 --> 00:44:13,630
go like yeah i don't know i

1228
00:44:13,630 --> 00:44:14,320

1229
00:44:15,190 --> 00:44:16,810
what you said mandatory we're gonna fight

1230
00:44:16,810 --> 00:44:19,600

00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:21,160

1232
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:24,430

1233
00:44:28,510 --> 00:44:29,890
we're gonna draw straws to see who

1234
00:44:29,890 --> 00:44:32,860
stays married i don't know what i

1235
00:44:32,890 --> 00:44:34,180
what i did as a kid i

1236
00:44:34,325 --> 00:44:35,500
i guess one thing that came to

1237
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:36,970
mind initially was that i could ride

1238
00:44:36,970 --> 00:44:39,100
my bike without my hands but i

1239
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:40,870
can't do that now i couldn't do

1240
00:44:40,870 --> 00:44:41,950
it then i can't do it now

1241
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:43,390
i should be able to do it

1242
00:44:43,390 --> 00:44:44,410
then i wonder if i could do

1243
00:44:44,410 --> 00:44:45,370
it i don't i do not know

1244
00:44:45,370 --> 00:44:45,580
what the

1245
00:44:45,610 --> 00:44:47,110
secret is just to put my feet

1246
00:44:47,110 --> 00:44:49,374
up on the handlebars while i was

1247
00:44:49,390 --> 00:44:51,370
eating i could like do little things

1248
00:44:51,370 --> 00:44:53,350
to my cigarette not do that now

1249
00:44:53,350 --> 00:44:54,610
at all and i would not even

1250
00:44:54,610 --> 00:44:58,600
try honestly i i sort of miss

1251
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:00,550
waterskiing i'm sure i've talked about it

1252
00:45:00,550 --> 00:45:01,450
but i feel like the last time

1253
00:45:01,450 --> 00:45:03,190
i ever did it was when i

1254
00:45:03,190 --> 00:45:04,780
was twenty two but i still feel

1255
00:45:04,780 --> 00:45:05,650
like i could do it

1256
00:45:06,970 --> 00:45:08,080
even though it was i don't think

1257
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:09,700
it was a childhood thing at all

1258
00:45:10,090 --> 00:45:11,710
no but i mean but now i've

1259
00:45:11,740 --> 00:45:13,210
i feel like ah wouldn't i break

1260
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:14,320
my neck doing it or something i

1261
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:15,460

1273
00:45:38,260 --> 00:45:40,900
living well into your late nineties i

1274
00:45:40,930 --> 00:45:42,640
come from ah i come from a

1275
00:45:42,970 --> 00:45:44,650
people who lived

1276
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:47,260
in into their late nineties i don't

1277
00:45:47,260 --> 00:45:50,379
but it also doesn't seem fun and

1278
00:45:50,379 --> 00:45:52,240
well written no it does seem like

1279
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:55,210
when you get really but then again

1280
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:56,590
i gotta say all the old people

1281
00:45:56,590 --> 00:45:57,970
that i that are in their nineties

1282
00:45:57,970 --> 00:46:00,610
that i've known were all from generations

1283
00:46:00,610 --> 00:46:02,950
where they came from generations where they

1284
00:46:02,950 --> 00:46:04,750
were smoking and like yeah

1285
00:46:05,020 --> 00:46:06,550
all this stuff that that we know

1286
00:46:06,550 --> 00:46:08,020
is bad now so maybe they weren't

that retiring is ah is for actors

1316
00:47:16,810 --> 00:47:17,800
because yeah like you can do that

1317
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:19,510
in every job yeah but like that's

1318
00:47:19,510 --> 00:47:21,370
such a key like betty white is

1319
00:47:21,370 --> 00:47:23,350
so you know with it because she's

1320
00:47:23,380 --> 00:47:25,120
like you know working on tv shows

1321
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:27,610
well into her older age yeah and

1322
00:47:27,610 --> 00:47:29,620
like it seems so cool it'll be

1323
00:47:29,620 --> 00:47:30,460
a hard day

1324
00:47:30,670 --> 00:47:33,100
if there's ever a forced retirement where

1325
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:36,160
like people go yeah you don't really

1326
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:38,170
have any job prospects anymore like you

1327
00:47:38,170 --> 00:47:41,380

1328
00:47:41,380 --> 00:47:43,300

1330
00:47:45,010 --> 00:47:46,540

this shows like seven seconds long and

1344
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:09,070
i'm like a weird platform you need

1345
00:48:09,070 --> 00:48:10,750
to pay forty dollars a day

1346
00:48:10,810 --> 00:48:11,170
four

1347
00:48:14,170 --> 00:48:16,840

1348
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:18,160
like i guess i was fun back

00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:21,250
to my mansion i think i think

1350
00:48:21,250 --> 00:48:22,540
youtube is actors i think it will

1351
00:48:22,540 --> 00:48:25,360
be fine getting old i just think

1352
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:26,770
that at a certain point if i

1353
00:48:26,770 --> 00:48:28,510
want to make stuff people will be

1354
00:48:28,510 --> 00:48:31,300
like and now we'll know but when

1355
00:48:31,330 --> 00:48:32,410
when really old people

1356
00:48:32,410 --> 00:48:34,090
i'll start pitching ideas you know you

1357
00:48:34,096 --> 00:48:34,480

this business who are making things yeah

1361
00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:44,110
totally totally but you had your legacy

1362
00:48:44,110 --> 00:48:46,240
established thing if you keep working i

1363
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:47,560
think you're okay if you just never

00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:49,300
stop you know it's it yeah i

1365
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:52,150
did work with someone once who um

00:48:52,330 --> 00:48:54,310
had worked for awhile and then had

1367
00:48:54,310 --> 00:48:55,690
a family and had

1368
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:56,890
and worked in like ten years and

1369
00:48:56,890 --> 00:48:57,820
then it was like i'm getting back

1370
00:48:57,820 --> 00:48:59,410
into it and then they pitched just

1371
00:48:59,410 --> 00:49:00,880
like the worst jokes and i was

1372
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:02,890
kind of like oh i gotta say

1373
00:49:02,890 --> 00:49:05,080

myself last night i

1379
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:18,730

1382
00:49:23,020 --> 00:49:24,280
this is crazy how did i know

1383
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:27,010
that i was watching you um war

1384
00:49:27,010 --> 00:49:28,750
of the worlds on epics which is

1385
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:31,690
very well done but it's extremely grim

1386
00:49:31,690 --> 00:49:33,040
there's like not a light moment in

1387
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:35,050
it i mean i'm that that recent

1388
00:49:35,050 --> 00:49:35,980
tom cruise film was

1389
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:38,290
grimm i was surprised by how fucking

1390
00:49:38,470 --> 00:49:41,200
dark oh yes yeah but i i

1391
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:42,670
like i was i was looking at

1392
00:49:42,670 --> 00:49:44,770
my phone and when the first episode

1393
00:49:44,770 --> 00:49:46,240
started and i was like you know

1394
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:47,620
what i'm just gonna i'm gonna put

1395
00:49:47,620 --> 00:49:49,810
it over and on the charger not

1396
00:49:49,810 --> 00:49:51,160
gonna i'm not gonna look at it

1397
00:49:51,610 --> 00:49:54,490
and it was actually it it was

1398
00:49:54,490 --> 00:49:56,140
difficult at first because it was

1399
00:49:56,170 --> 00:49:58,210
just the reflex of like i'm gonna

1400
00:49:58,216 --> 00:50:00,760
grab my phone and whatever yes but

1401
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:02,710
then it felt so good to that

1402
00:50:02,710 --> 00:50:05,230
i made myself do it right so

1403
00:50:05,230 --> 00:50:08,860
good to focus on something especially a

1404
00:50:08,860 --> 00:50:10,510
nice like a piece of art like

1405
00:50:10,510 --> 00:50:11,710
a show that's like a fast and

1406
00:50:11,710 --> 00:50:13,930
furious movie or well even that you

1407
00:50:13,930 --> 00:50:16,330
know exactly just to

1408
00:50:16,330 --> 00:50:17,530
go i'm watching this this is what

1409
00:50:17,710 --> 00:50:20,324
exactly nine percent visual anyway you know

1410
00:50:20,362 --> 00:50:22,720
someone someone was writing an essay on

1411
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:24,700
the movies the other day thomas swift

1412
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:27,850
they said that that um if you

1413
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:29,290
if you watch something on cable it's

1414
00:50:29,290 --> 00:50:30,790
too easy to dip out after ten

1415
00:50:30,790 --> 00:50:34,052
minutes because like if you are or

1416
00:50:34,052 --> 00:50:35,740
or or even just like streaming it's

1417
00:50:35,740 --> 00:50:36,421
too easy to go

1418
00:50:37,269 --> 00:50:38,745
i'm not interested in pick up your

1419
00:50:38,745 --> 00:50:40,155
phone whereas if you're forced to watch

1420
00:50:40,155 --> 00:50:43,545
something in a movie theater after maybe

1421
00:50:43,545 --> 00:50:45,075
iraqi ten minutes you can start to

1422
00:50:45,075 --> 00:50:46,695
enjoy something where you would never give

1423
00:50:46,695 --> 00:50:47,925
it the chance oh yeah i remember

1424
00:50:47,955 --> 00:50:49,515
rocky ten minutes picture show you have

1425
00:50:49,515 --> 00:50:50,925
come i also want to point out

1426
00:50:50,925 --> 00:50:53,445
i met jonathan swift earlier amy wait

1427
00:50:53,445 --> 00:50:55,215
what did you say i said thomas

1428
00:50:55,215 --> 00:50:57,105
swift i don't think oh tom swift

1429
00:50:57,105 --> 00:50:57,285
was

1430
00:50:57,285 --> 00:50:59,625
like a yeah he's like a revolution

1431
00:50:59,625 --> 00:51:02,385
and adventurer something yeah yeah um wait

1432
00:51:02,385 --> 00:51:04,035
so reform and make a great tom

1433
00:51:04,035 --> 00:51:06,405
swift by the way what i think

1434
00:51:06,405 --> 00:51:09,195
he's a kid isn't he yeah you

1435
00:51:09,195 --> 00:51:11,355
and your kid outfit goes make up

1436
00:51:11,475 --> 00:51:14,205
his tom swift is like huck i

1437
00:51:14,565 --> 00:51:15,944
kind of i think but like a

1438
00:51:15,944 --> 00:51:17,445
later period i don't i

1439
00:51:17,445 --> 00:51:19,725
never read those books but i think

1440
00:51:19,725 --> 00:51:21,915
he was like from the z like

1441
00:51:21,915 --> 00:51:24,015
from the fifties from the nineteen i

1442
00:51:24,015 --> 00:51:26,415
just remember my little referee like wow

1443
00:51:26,445 --> 00:51:29,115
like reading tom swift dime novels you

1444
00:51:29,115 --> 00:51:30,165
know but it looks like it went

1445
00:51:30,165 --> 00:51:31,785
into the fifties like the style of

1446
00:51:31,785 --> 00:51:34,035
the books got more yeah by the

1447
00:51:34,035 --> 00:51:35,475
way thank you to so many listeners

1448
00:51:35,475 --> 00:51:37,305
for telling me that the stories

1449
00:51:37,635 --> 00:51:38,715
the books that i read where the

1450
00:51:38,715 --> 00:51:41,865
alf alfred hitchcock presents ah oh yeah

1451
00:51:41,895 --> 00:51:43,605
that's not that was the three adventurers

1452
00:51:43,605 --> 00:51:45,705
of the three adventurers yeah yes that's

1453
00:51:45,705 --> 00:51:46,515
the one where people are trying to

1454
00:51:46,515 --> 00:51:48,645
figure out that quote that you know

1455
00:51:48,645 --> 00:51:50,595
that was something different yeah okay um

1456
00:51:50,625 --> 00:51:53,235
i also wonder even touching back on

1457
00:51:53,295 --> 00:51:56,235
the dog and addressing dog ga story

1458
00:51:56,235 --> 00:51:57,765
from earlier that i

1459
00:51:58,425 --> 00:52:01,485
i have had a sort of fear

1460
00:52:01,485 --> 00:52:04,635
of dogs get missing being missing ever

1461
00:52:04,635 --> 00:52:05,865

and even though i know you so

1671
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:45,690

1672
01:02:45,690 --> 01:02:46,350
surprise me

1673
01:02:46,890 --> 01:02:48,240

1676
01:02:51,210 --> 01:02:53,220
the basics out of the way ah

1677
01:02:53,760 --> 01:02:55,530

01:02:55,530 --> 01:02:56,250
for office

1679
01:02:57,480 --> 01:03:04,650
this is a difficult thing to talk

1680
01:03:05,490 --> 01:03:13,470
about but i always wanted to be

1681
01:03:13,950 --> 01:03:14,400
a

1682
01:03:16,320 --> 01:03:23,640
emperor but we know that is it

1683
01:03:24,270 --> 01:03:28,020
ah thing here will sure i mean

1684
01:03:28,020 --> 01:03:29,130
you've talked about wanting to be an

1685
01:03:29,130 --> 01:03:31,020
emperor ever since we were young children

1686
01:03:31,020 --> 01:03:32,430
playing in the school yard you are

1687
01:03:32,430 --> 01:03:34,500
always saying i love the emperor and

1688
01:03:34,500 --> 01:03:35,610
star wars

1689
01:03:35,670 --> 01:03:38,670
and you know palpatine is my hero

1690
01:03:38,670 --> 01:03:40,230
and so i knew that going in

1691
01:03:40,230 --> 01:03:42,900
but but why here why now well

1692
01:03:43,770 --> 01:03:49,560
finally i can tell you that

1693
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:55,440
i'm dying o of what

1694
01:03:56,520 --> 01:04:03,420
a big disease how big souls

1695
01:04:05,790 --> 01:04:09,270

one hour

1698
01:04:14,550 --> 01:04:16,110

1699
01:04:16,110 --> 01:04:18,870
for your chances i and

1700
01:04:20,250 --> 01:04:20,820

decades oh okay well that's i mean

1702
01:04:25,500 --> 01:04:26,640
that opens it up a little bit

1703
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:28,080
then i think i can see why

1704
01:04:28,080 --> 01:04:29,130
you would want to spend your last

1705
01:04:29,130 --> 01:04:30,630
twenty years on earth i mean you

1706
01:04:30,630 --> 01:04:32,880
may die before that not of whatever

1707
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:34,560
disease the big disease you have but

1708
01:04:34,560 --> 01:04:36,060
you may like you know get hit

1709
01:04:36,060 --> 01:04:37,800

01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:49,050
your platform though

to get that in there without a

1745
01:06:38,970 --> 01:06:44,850
funnel right i've thought about this so

1746
01:06:45,840 --> 01:06:47,640
many times

1747
01:06:51,690 --> 01:06:57,630

1748
01:06:57,630 --> 01:06:59,280
is just making me emotional i've known

1749
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:00,720
you for so long and to think

1750
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:03,630
that you've been thinking about shooting glass

1751
01:07:03,630 --> 01:07:05,490
for this whole time while we've had

1752
01:07:05,490 --> 01:07:08,700
so many meaningful deep conversations on my

1753
01:07:08,700 --> 01:07:08,970
end

1754
01:07:09,090 --> 01:07:10,350

1756
01:07:14,220 --> 01:07:17,310
