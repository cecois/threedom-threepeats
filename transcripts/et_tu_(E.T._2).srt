to boost

178
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:34,560
it is absolute all new today so

179
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,330
who told me this and then and

180
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:37,890
then i'm looking down here it says

181
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,620
in french it's it so i think

182
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:43,440
somebody thought that was a french phrase

183
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,380
dumb but it's probably last person's stupid

184
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,000
it is latin of course yeah it's

185
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,890
from latin times but so so i

186
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:51,030
gotta figure who told me that

187
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:53,550

each other all the time yeah i've

196
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:11,220
got to get that number i guess

197
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:11,460
that

198
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,440
i can't describe what the tweet was

199
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,450
basically saying i'm out of social media

200
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:16,620
time today i've already used it okay

201
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:18,150
but let me let me paraphrase yeah

202
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:20,550
that you came to him and said

203
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:21,930
by the way i read i read

204
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,630
reading i read something today today and

205
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:26,280
it was dumb about a bundle anyways

206
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:27,330
i told you that

207
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,920
hey like i guess you read that

208
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:35,610
yeah and so he tweeted about it

209
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:37,470
and the people are loving love it

210
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:39,330
because it's a little slice of like

211
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:42,270
inner personal dynamics that happens all the

212
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:45,720
time yeah it's great anyway so universal

213
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,650
i feel like it's the kind of

214
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:49,500
thing that will get stolen right somebody

215
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:50,790
will claim it as it'll be it'll

216
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:52,740
end up being honest to come soon

say this is the lowest of the

481
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,410

rubs against part of my eye and

496
00:16:34,992 --> 00:16:36,220
it causes pressure and that can lead

497
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:37,690
to glaucoma but what does that mean

498
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:38,950
the pigment of your eye

499
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,900

spray a testicle there was no smell

584
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:31,180

00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,984
um a picture of one ball but

586
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,140

00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:48,220
had one ball yearning he had none

592
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:49,630
at all this is what they would

593
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:50,740
do during world war two to keep

594
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:52,900
spirits up yeah that's true so they

595
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,190
were nagging i don't know if it's

596
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:56,260
true that going had no balls but

597
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,100
but it's the kind of thing you'd

598
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:57,970
seem to have a little fun when

599
00:19:57,970 --> 00:20:00,010
these athletes existing in the movie a

600
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:01,720
separate piece like you're trying to commit

601
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:02,080
a genocide

602
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,910
guide will show you here's yeah only

603
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:06,040
have one ball he's like who cares

604
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:09,100
he's only got half the stash i

605
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:11,110
do want to write what he lowers

606
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:14,560
the original girlboss yeah maybe only having

607
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,990
one ball led him to like doing

608
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:18,340
whatever you want hey there's only like

609
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,840
one ball i'm gonna live my life

610
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:20,440
till i die

611
00:20:22,395 --> 00:20:23,535
we should all cut off one of

612
00:20:23,535 --> 00:20:24,795
our balls but here's the other thing

613
00:20:24,795 --> 00:20:27,465
that the opposite is she had to

614
00:20:27,495 --> 00:20:29,895
ah she was taking different pictures of

615
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:32,385
my eyes than had been done previously

616
00:20:32,805 --> 00:20:34,965
and she said okay look up and

617
00:20:34,965 --> 00:20:36,105
then she took her look at my

618
00:20:36,105 --> 00:20:38,505
index finger oh and she pulled down

619
00:20:38,595 --> 00:20:40,245
okay you know my eye the way

620
00:20:40,245 --> 00:20:41,265
you do when you're a little kid

621
00:20:41,265 --> 00:20:42,285
to make a scary face right

622
00:20:42,315 --> 00:20:43,699
side note i think that people who

623
00:20:43,699 --> 00:20:45,315
work with eyes have the cleanest hands

624
00:20:45,315 --> 00:20:47,295
in the biz you think i just

625
00:20:47,295 --> 00:20:48,885
picture them you hushing i think so

626
00:20:48,885 --> 00:20:51,495
today long but her her hands were

627
00:20:51,495 --> 00:20:54,375
very she was a slight woman right

628
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:57,225
small saucepan and it felt so nice

629
00:20:57,225 --> 00:20:58,815
i don't know why but it really

630
00:20:58,815 --> 00:21:01,335
surprised me i hire someone who's suppose

631
00:21:01,335 --> 00:21:02,235
your eyes down

632
00:21:03,465 --> 00:21:05,685
not every day just my my birthday

633
00:21:06,315 --> 00:21:07,575
but i agree i think there's a

634
00:21:07,575 --> 00:21:09,105
certain kind of touch that makes you

635
00:21:09,105 --> 00:21:11,295
go yeah oh my i don't know

636
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:13,065
there's something about it and then she

637
00:21:13,095 --> 00:21:14,655
did she and then she pushed my

638
00:21:14,655 --> 00:21:17,205
eyebrow up when i looked down and

639
00:21:17,205 --> 00:21:19,185
then the other eye she did the

640
00:21:19,185 --> 00:21:20,776
eyebrow but she didn't do under the

641
00:21:20,776 --> 00:21:22,545
eyes a little discipline under why did

642
00:21:22,545 --> 00:21:22,605
she

643
00:21:22,638 --> 00:21:24,581
give a pathway i know i was

644
00:21:24,705 --> 00:21:25,965
looking forward to it after she did

645
00:21:25,965 --> 00:21:27,865
the first i was like oh yea

646
00:21:27,915 --> 00:21:29,625

helped me out and there was a

659
00:21:50,625 --> 00:21:52,365
nice gentleman who came in and did

660
00:21:52,365 --> 00:21:55,155
my and preliminary sort of paperwork discussing

661
00:21:55,155 --> 00:21:57,345
asking questions that kind of seventh tier

662
00:21:57,405 --> 00:21:59,385
one thing he said that i thought

663
00:21:59,385 --> 00:22:00,645
was interesting and i'll just throw it

664
00:22:00,645 --> 00:22:01,575
out there for the listener and you

666
00:22:03,135 --> 00:22:04,275
and if you disagree i don't want

667
00:22:04,275 --> 00:22:05,565
to hear it but i thought it

668
00:22:05,565 --> 00:22:06,885
was kinda interesting he asked me if

669
00:22:06,885 --> 00:22:08,355
i had any surgeries and while i

670
00:22:08,355 --> 00:22:10,065
haven't any surgeries i did mention having

671
00:22:10,065 --> 00:22:10,935
a baby because i was like wow

672
00:22:10,935 --> 00:22:12,825
know is that something and then he

673
00:22:12,825 --> 00:22:13,815
was like actually i'm really glad you

674
00:22:13,815 --> 00:22:16,845
said that because god's original surgery yeah

675
00:22:17,295 --> 00:22:18,975

678
00:22:24,135 --> 00:22:29,145
yes i look at my third ah

679
00:22:29,475 --> 00:22:31,545

680
00:22:31,545 --> 00:22:36,195
said that ah babies they have new

681
00:22:36,195 --> 00:22:38,219
technology basically i have horrible vision and

682
00:22:38,219 --> 00:22:40,305
the technology maybe some memories have let

683
00:22:40,305 --> 00:22:42,015
me if i don't tell you so

684
00:22:42,015 --> 00:22:43,215
when i was in my vision

685
00:22:43,275 --> 00:22:45,255
they're going bad when i was in

686
00:22:45,555 --> 00:22:48,225
second grade i needed glasses and ever

687
00:22:48,225 --> 00:22:49,725
since it's gotten progressively worse my entire

688
00:22:49,725 --> 00:22:51,825
life i have horrible vision but he

689
00:22:51,855 --> 00:22:53,985
shed better there's a new thing and

690
00:22:53,985 --> 00:22:55,665
i don't of course remember the name

691
00:22:55,725 --> 00:22:57,405
but i can figure it out glasses

692
00:22:57,645 --> 00:22:59,325
but there's new treatments for little kids

693
00:22:59,325 --> 00:23:01,275
that help them so that thinking classes

694
00:23:01,275 --> 00:23:03,405
are the baby oh can prevent

695
00:23:03,435 --> 00:23:04,755
all the stuff from happening later i

696
00:23:04,755 --> 00:23:06,465
can just make sure i'll stay better

697
00:23:06,465 --> 00:23:08,835
longer and so he said maybe should

698
00:23:08,835 --> 00:23:10,635
actually be checked at the one year

699
00:23:10,635 --> 00:23:11,985
mark and then you get to come

700
00:23:11,985 --> 00:23:13,545
back until they're three but a lot

701
00:23:13,545 --> 00:23:14,625
of a lot of times they'll say

702
00:23:14,625 --> 00:23:17,685
your doctor has key sectors ah yeah

703
00:23:17,865 --> 00:23:20,715

who'd come to our house and i

802

think he's probably a college student but

803
00:26:19,305 --> 00:26:20,475
he seemed really old to me because

804
00:26:20,475 --> 00:26:22,035
i was five i don't remember this

805
00:26:22,035 --> 00:26:24,435
but i wanna hear it he always

806
00:26:24,465 --> 00:26:25,215
he had like kind of

807
00:26:25,275 --> 00:26:26,805
greasy like long hair in the early

808
00:26:26,985 --> 00:26:28,995
and he was a greaser layer was

809
00:26:28,995 --> 00:26:30,765

812
00:26:33,795 --> 00:26:34,575
hair out of the way while he

813
00:26:34,575 --> 00:26:36,105

815
00:26:38,625 --> 00:26:41,025

817
00:26:43,665 --> 00:26:45,225

818
00:26:45,225 --> 00:26:45,339
like

819
00:26:45,405 --> 00:26:46,395

820
00:26:46,395 --> 00:26:49,125

826
00:26:58,335 --> 00:26:59,745
also if you're changing your name just

827
00:26:59,745 --> 00:27:02,265
go like lie about the reason you're

828
00:27:02,265 --> 00:27:04,605
changing it not just like oh i'm

1069
00:35:01,225 --> 00:35:02,845
less competition it's just here should we

1070
00:35:02,845 --> 00:35:04,525
call it yeah if you were competition

1071
00:35:04,525 --> 00:35:06,685
it's getting very interesting already i was

1072
00:35:06,685 --> 00:35:08,695
way more engaged there's only been one

1073
00:35:08,695 --> 00:35:10,084
episode i know this but i'm taking

1074
00:35:10,405 --> 00:35:12,775
fish episode the worst okay but i

1075
00:35:12,775 --> 00:35:14,125
thought it was better than normal and

1076
00:35:14,125 --> 00:35:14,995
by the way looks my phone the

1077
00:35:14,995 --> 00:35:16,345
entire time but i'm saying it was

1078
00:35:16,345 --> 00:35:16,885
so funny

1079
00:35:17,695 --> 00:35:19,795
and then what happened next would shock

1080
00:35:19,795 --> 00:35:21,535
anyone a new show came on and

1081
00:35:21,535 --> 00:35:22,945
i stayed to watch it live but

1082
00:35:22,945 --> 00:35:25,705
we know joe jonas joe jonas nick

1083
00:35:25,825 --> 00:35:28,855
nerve no no-nos kevin go jonas kevin

1084
00:35:28,855 --> 00:35:31,975

1085
00:35:32,215 --> 00:35:33,745

or it's gonna be on hulu by

1088
00:35:36,805 --> 00:35:39,025
eob before episodes now i guess um

1089
00:35:39,355 --> 00:35:40,675
really fun show i thought was gonna

1090
00:35:40,675 --> 00:35:43,315
be not interesting it's the premise is

1091
00:35:43,585 --> 00:35:46,435
that family members of famous people so

1092
00:35:46,495 --> 00:35:49,165
like a cousin a grandson on sister

1093
00:35:49,165 --> 00:35:51,295
whenever are the people live in la

1094
00:35:51,295 --> 00:35:54,085
jolla and and other day nobody knows

1095
00:35:54,085 --> 00:35:55,825
who they're related to but they have

1096
00:35:55,885 --> 00:35:57,655
try to guess who your celebrity relative

1097
00:35:57,655 --> 00:35:59,095
is with clues and all these different

1098
00:35:59,095 --> 00:36:00,025
things that has a race of the

1099
00:36:00,025 --> 00:36:00,310
people

1100
00:36:02,298 --> 00:36:05,095
it's really fun i thought it would

1101
00:36:05,095 --> 00:36:06,595
be really silly but to admit it

1102
00:36:06,595 --> 00:36:08,817

no i get a but like frankie

1113
00:36:25,915 --> 00:36:27,925

00:36:28,375 --> 00:36:30,535
being ariana grande's right brother on big

1115
00:36:30,535 --> 00:36:32,425
brother right but it was he was

1116
00:36:32,425 --> 00:36:34,135
the little brother on big brother anyway

00:36:34,135 --> 00:36:35,725
never anyway it's really fun you you

1118
00:36:35,725 --> 00:36:36,955

00:36:36,955 --> 00:36:38,875
relatives are as a viewer but some

1120
00:36:38,875 --> 00:36:39,595
you don't know so you get to

1121
00:36:39,595 --> 00:36:41,305
still try to keep guessing there was

1122
00:36:41,305 --> 00:36:41,905
one in the first

1123
00:36:41,935 --> 00:36:43,375

00:36:43,375 --> 00:36:45,145
was related to and it was very

1125
00:36:45,145 --> 00:36:46,435
fun and i was like that's probably

1126
00:36:46,435 --> 00:36:48,235
right and then it's a fun okay

1127
00:36:48,505 --> 00:36:51,115

00:37:03,385 --> 00:37:05,095
way speaking of the rookie i saw

1137
00:37:05,095 --> 00:37:08,665
some some article that said it was

1138
00:37:08,665 --> 00:37:10,435
nathan fielder is the king of cringe

1139
00:37:10,435 --> 00:37:13,075
comedy and i thought it said nathan

1140
00:37:13,075 --> 00:37:15,595
fillion when i was looking at it

1141
00:37:15,595 --> 00:37:17,215
going like trying to figure out i

1142
00:37:17,215 --> 00:37:19,015
was like when is it coming comedy

1143
00:37:19,075 --> 00:37:21,685
the rookie is nodded what are we

1144
00:37:21,685 --> 00:37:22,255
telling doc

1145
00:37:22,315 --> 00:37:24,209
our horrible sing-a-long blog there's a lot

1146
00:37:24,209 --> 00:37:25,195
of there's a lot of cringe comedy

1147
00:37:25,195 --> 00:37:26,635
in the rookie though i and i

1148
00:37:26,635 --> 00:37:27,985
love nathan fillion but i was just

1149
00:37:27,985 --> 00:37:29,455
really trying to parse this and go

1150
00:37:29,455 --> 00:37:31,315
like why are they making this wild

1151
00:37:31,315 --> 00:37:32,665
claim and then it turns out your

1152
00:37:32,665 --> 00:37:35,545
dough yeah well the phone was far

1153
00:37:35,545 --> 00:37:37,855
away from my eyes i will know

1154
00:37:37,855 --> 00:37:39,115
what i recently read a headline that

1155
00:37:39,115 --> 00:37:41,485
also shouted the hail this was a

1156
00:37:41,485 --> 00:37:42,415
headline about ah

1157
00:37:42,595 --> 00:37:44,695
alan hay about a woman skipper a

1158
00:37:44,695 --> 00:37:47,395
woman whose interior decorator and said like

1159
00:37:47,845 --> 00:37:49,165
her home is a fever dream of

1160
00:37:49,165 --> 00:37:50,455
patterns and then i went and let

1161
00:37:50,455 --> 00:37:52,405
those walls shed three shades of white

1162
00:37:52,405 --> 00:37:53,935
on her walls so she says i

1163
00:37:53,935 --> 00:37:54,865
used three different shades of white and

1164
00:37:54,865 --> 00:37:55,825
then it was like she makes pet

1165
00:37:55,825 --> 00:37:57,055
things that are gingham and they're cute

1166
00:37:57,055 --> 00:37:59,125
but it was like it wasn't crazy

1167
00:37:59,155 --> 00:38:01,435
no way a fever like the madonna

1168
00:38:01,435 --> 00:38:02,575
inn or no wo

1169
00:38:02,575 --> 00:38:03,859
oh yeah yeah there's so many ways

1170
00:38:03,859 --> 00:38:05,061
you have a billion patterns and ramos

1171
00:38:05,061 --> 00:38:06,115
like this is not that and she

1172
00:38:06,115 --> 00:38:07,765
didn't claim to be that the author

1173
00:38:07,855 --> 00:38:10,795
right when phrases like that get so

1174
00:38:10,795 --> 00:38:14,605
overused it really it's it's so it

1175
00:38:14,635 --> 00:38:16,435
it's wearying yeah i'm just like oh

1176
00:38:16,435 --> 00:38:17,665
wow i'm gonna look at something crazy

1177
00:38:17,725 --> 00:38:19,405
behind i was anger believes and i

1178
00:38:19,405 --> 00:38:21,295

1179
00:38:21,295 --> 00:38:22,735
though it while it's certainly

1180
00:38:22,735 --> 00:38:24,565
the book and i almost bought something

1181
00:38:24,565 --> 00:38:26,365
for our website but that doesn't know

1182
00:38:26,365 --> 00:38:28,045
but i live in the energy pattern

1183
00:38:28,795 --> 00:38:29,875
how close did you get to bike

1184
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,345
so i'm really close but it was

1185
00:38:31,345 --> 00:38:32,455
a little overpriced and i was like

1186
00:38:32,455 --> 00:38:33,835
do i really need this where you

1187
00:38:33,835 --> 00:38:35,995
hovering over the hovered over the kicker

1188
00:38:36,475 --> 00:38:38,065
and it was a tissue box cover

1189
00:38:38,125 --> 00:38:39,383
but wish i had a little i'm

1190
00:38:39,383 --> 00:38:41,096
looking scary and you've been looking for

1191
00:38:41,096 --> 00:38:42,475
a tissue box cover why why do

1192
00:38:42,475 --> 00:38:42,895
you not like

1193
00:38:42,925 --> 00:38:44,935
the actual sushi because they make the

1194
00:38:44,965 --> 00:38:46,856
tissue boxes themselves in these nice pattern

1195
00:38:46,856 --> 00:38:48,145

1204
00:39:03,085 --> 00:39:04,255

oh oh no other podcasts doing that

1474
00:48:14,910 --> 00:48:16,260

1475
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:17,850
i don't think anyone is making custom

1476
00:48:17,850 --> 00:48:19,080
nightcaps for sure

1477
00:48:21,365 --> 00:48:22,949
go down to the crack yeah they

1478
00:48:22,949 --> 00:48:24,570
can't go to a sense of pride

1479
00:48:24,570 --> 00:48:27,600
huh that's impractical for sleeping you just

1480
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:29,854
tuck it into the you strangle yourself

1481
00:48:29,884 --> 00:48:32,160
your pajama waistband it's going to get

00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:34,110
pulled off strangle yourself oh god that

1483
00:48:34,110 --> 00:48:35,370
would be horrible if we made those

1484
00:48:35,370 --> 00:48:38,490
and someone strangled themselves yes oh and

1485
00:48:38,490 --> 00:48:39,480
i was like i remember when i

1486
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:40,410
was a kid there was

1487
00:48:40,410 --> 00:48:42,810
was this is before this shit got

1488
00:48:42,810 --> 00:48:44,280
outlawed this is before you were an

1489
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:46,410
adult but there was before

1490
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:48,900
like there was a do remember the

1491
00:48:48,904 --> 00:48:51,780
micro knots yeah um we were toys

1492
00:48:51,810 --> 00:48:55,410
tiny tiny teeny tiny um hold on

1493
00:48:57,120 --> 00:48:58,950
astronauts the toys themselves were not as

1494
00:48:58,950 --> 00:49:00,480
small as you would think no they

1495
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:04,050
were um micro machines yeah no we're

1496
00:49:04,052 --> 00:49:06,570
the commercial famously narrated by joshua junior

1497
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:08,250
i loved how small those were they

1498
00:49:08,250 --> 00:49:10,050
were micro that's really funny you didn't

1499
00:49:10,050 --> 00:49:11,700
need a microscope to see them oh

1500
00:49:11,701 --> 00:49:12,900
but they were in the palm of

1501
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:14,910
a child's hand interestingly enough i think

1502
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:16,620
i had some but the main

1503
00:49:16,650 --> 00:49:17,790
reason i knew them is because they

1504
00:49:17,790 --> 00:49:20,550
were marvel comics and they were integrated

1505
00:49:20,550 --> 00:49:23,040
into the actual marvel universe yeah and

1506
00:49:23,070 --> 00:49:25,440
and they were licensed property where now

1507
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:27,690
you can't reprint any of any because

1508
00:49:27,690 --> 00:49:29,700
they would interact with the x-men's right

1509
00:49:29,850 --> 00:49:32,700
right they can't be reprinted anymore because

1510
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:34,110
the micro knots other than the ones

1511
00:49:34,110 --> 00:49:35,580
they created for the comic book or

1512
00:49:35,580 --> 00:49:36,810
not um abe

1513
00:49:36,843 --> 00:49:38,340
to be reprinted so it's like those

1514
00:49:38,340 --> 00:49:40,410
are lost forever that i had news

1515
00:49:40,410 --> 00:49:42,180

they need each other eight had a

1520
00:49:52,950 --> 00:49:54,810
lot of articulation points but i remember

had fists that you could shoot oh

1526
00:50:07,020 --> 00:50:08,220
i love that you would like press

it's it even one child dying just

1540
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:34,320
not worth it but here's the thing

1541
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:35,760
someone pointed out that i saw this

1542
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:38,070

1543
00:50:38,130 --> 00:50:39,720

00:51:05,645 --> 00:51:08,135
hundred guns and everyone jerry

1558
00:51:08,495 --> 00:51:09,905
yeah yeah don't be great if you

1559
00:51:09,905 --> 00:51:11,465
ended it was like a library and

1560
00:51:11,465 --> 00:51:12,695
so i think it doesn't check it

1561
00:51:12,695 --> 00:51:14,555
out of the library yeah and it

1562
00:51:14,555 --> 00:51:16,355
was they were in libraries if you

1563
00:51:16,355 --> 00:51:17,255
keep it out early you have to

1564
00:51:17,255 --> 00:51:19,745
pay for yeah good you know record

1565
00:51:19,745 --> 00:51:21,245
of returning on time it's right i

1566
00:51:21,245 --> 00:51:24,365
remember when they they started having cds

1567
00:51:24,365 --> 00:51:25,505
that you could check out the library

1568
00:51:25,505 --> 00:51:26,795
and i was shocked because i was

1569
00:51:26,795 --> 00:51:28,415
like those aren't books

1570
00:51:29,435 --> 00:51:31,777
and and then video and movies someday

1571
00:51:31,777 --> 00:51:32,915
your ass kicked you after you said

1572
00:51:32,915 --> 00:51:33,095
that

1573
00:51:35,465 --> 00:51:36,545
but it was just shocking to me

1574
00:51:36,545 --> 00:51:39,395
the idea that you could because libraries

1575
00:51:39,395 --> 00:51:41,461
had always been for books yeah and

1576
00:51:41,461 --> 00:51:44,015
sand records in the library well i

1577
00:51:44,015 --> 00:51:45,485
mean maybe nothing

1578
00:51:46,565 --> 00:51:48,185
hey alright

1579
00:51:49,955 --> 00:51:51,035

00:51:51,035 --> 00:51:53,375
a three-match there's also maps and stuff

1581
00:51:53,375 --> 00:51:55,323

man and agenda key really maps so

1583
00:51:59,855 --> 00:52:01,955
you could check or or or were

1584
00:52:01,955 --> 00:52:03,455

00:54:09,455 --> 00:54:10,685
in front of a lot of cool

1642
00:54:10,685 --> 00:54:12,695
hipster people and that was

1643
00:54:12,725 --> 00:54:14,345
embarrassing for me the sound it makes

1644
00:54:14,375 --> 00:54:15,965
when somebody walks into a glass doors

1645
00:54:16,295 --> 00:54:18,515
it's quite glad when it also like

1646
00:54:18,515 --> 00:54:20,711
laughs at you it's like yeah what

1647
00:54:20,711 --> 00:54:22,295
a hard one for me to witness

1648
00:54:22,295 --> 00:54:23,495
because i would have wanted to laugh

1649
00:54:23,495 --> 00:54:24,395
at you but i would have thought

1650
00:54:24,395 --> 00:54:26,075
bad thing i would've been trying not

1651
00:54:26,075 --> 00:54:27,635
to laugh when you're a terrible person

1652
00:54:27,635 --> 00:54:29,195
but it's just hard because i would

1653
00:54:29,195 --> 00:54:30,215
just like i would have wanted to

1654
00:54:30,215 --> 00:54:32,885
enjoy my day laughing wait because

1655
00:54:32,885 --> 00:54:35,105
cause during my day because you know

1656
00:54:35,105 --> 00:54:36,185
me you would have won the last

1657
00:54:36,215 --> 00:54:38,015
four i wouldn't concerned if you had

1658
00:54:38,015 --> 00:54:40,025
if i would have wanted to laugh

1659
00:54:40,205 --> 00:54:41,855
pretty much whoever it is but i

1660
00:54:41,855 --> 00:54:43,955
think no human would make it funnier

1661
00:54:44,495 --> 00:54:46,655
and i would be telling myself it's

1662
00:54:46,655 --> 00:54:47,735
mean to laugh so i'd have to

1663
00:54:47,735 --> 00:54:48,965
stop right but i would have gone

1664
00:54:49,025 --> 00:54:50,045
i just missed out on some really

1665
00:54:50,045 --> 00:54:50,585
good laughs

1666
00:54:51,605 --> 00:54:52,775
you have to laugh at something i

1667
00:54:52,835 --> 00:54:54,425
find funny later i feel like if

1668
00:54:54,425 --> 00:54:55,955
i didn't know the person i wouldn't

1669
00:54:55,955 --> 00:54:57,245
laugh but if i did know the

1670
00:54:57,245 --> 00:54:58,445
person i would i think that's probably

1671
00:54:58,445 --> 00:55:00,095
the difference yeah it's like it's sort

1672
00:55:00,095 --> 00:55:01,145
of funny if it's someone you don't

1673
00:55:01,145 --> 00:55:02,675
know because it's like they they want

1674
00:55:02,675 --> 00:55:04,715
full steam into a glass ball there's

1675
00:55:04,715 --> 00:55:05,945
no reason for them to do that

1676
00:55:05,975 --> 00:55:08,075
yeah right but if you know them

1677
00:55:09,035 --> 00:55:10,475
i believe i've told my story about

1678
00:55:10,475 --> 00:55:11,435

1679
00:55:11,855 --> 00:55:13,265

1723
00:56:40,535 --> 00:56:42,245

showed so they showed a brian coming

1865
01:01:21,139 --> 01:01:24,430
from brian cox of succession fame and

1866
01:01:24,490 --> 01:01:26,350
he literally if you have not heard

1867
01:01:26,350 --> 01:01:29,470
the episode he's literally just reading the

1868
01:01:29,470 --> 01:01:30,880
list of things that was sent to

1869
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:32,020
him about the person

1870
01:01:32,590 --> 01:01:34,840
it's the most like the least amount

1871
01:01:34,840 --> 01:01:36,190
of effort you can put into it

1872
01:01:36,370 --> 01:01:37,330
and then at the end he says

1873
01:01:37,540 --> 01:01:38,500
and if anyone gets in your face

1874
01:01:38,500 --> 01:01:39,700
you tell them to fuck off

1875
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:42,068
who knows what the people want and

1876
01:01:42,068 --> 01:01:44,080

1877
01:01:44,290 --> 01:01:47,110
whole seven seven hundred seventy back and

1878
01:01:47,140 --> 01:01:48,610
