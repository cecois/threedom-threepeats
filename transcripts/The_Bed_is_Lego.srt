did just stuff you could

34
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:17,520
pull at the top of your head

35
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:18,870
to make a claim happened to you

36
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:20,490

129
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:43,320

00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,110
she the the pie the parrot moved

140
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:08,460
a little ahead of the plate but

141
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:09,810
i think she could have gotten it

142
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,760
on the plate it was a good

143
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:16,050
throw but the announcer introduces her um

144
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,120
and says you know she's she plays

145
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,880
the female third baseman oh totally

146
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,290
league of their own they're all female

147
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:24,600
yes exact and also she's a woman

148
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:26,070

150
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:29,490

155
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:41,880
episode or season was real shame i

156
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,810
think he's a big pocket we're going

157
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:44,070
to talk about every listener by the

158
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:45,420
way on this episode yes yeah we're

159
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:46,620
starting with darcy who may or may

160
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:48,090
not listen but i won't get into

161
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:50,550
joseph really we know or letters we

162
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:52,560
assume listen people who listen

163
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,990
in in life oh look he's just

164
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:57,060
people who actually listen to things yeah

165
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:58,800
just people who lay people who listen

166
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,840
in lie pay attention are willing to

167
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,940
take criticism already again but we should

168
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:04,320
also we should talk about our hearing

169
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,720
impaired listeners when they listen in terms

170
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,730
yes in terms of receiving information yes

171
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:11,070
it will be talking about yes but

172
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:12,720
the announcer in addition to

173
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:16,080
giving her female credit um for league

174
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:16,830
of their own it's a good way

175
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:18,120
to put it that's the optimistic way

176
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,080
to look at it she got female

177
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,820
credit also said and it sounded like

178
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:26,700
this she plays janet on a good

179
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:27,150
place

180
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:29,640

00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:45,540
it before he looked at it and

189
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:46,860
maybe you can't see that but is

190
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:48,480
he supposed to be reading every single

191
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:50,730
thing that comes across his his desk

192
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:52,860
i would say if you're speaking to

193
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:55,230
save very little would be prepared at

194
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:56,910
least read it how many paired are

195
00:06:56,910 --> 00:06:59,250
you ah right now i'm not reading

196
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:01,620
something i can just spit from the

197
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:02,430
cuff yeah

198
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:06,480
i don't know that you can ah

199
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,760
after hearing that i was going to

200
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,140
be speaking into my throat in front

201
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:12,510
of a stadium of people i would

202
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:14,550
read it one said you're reading this

203
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:17,250
right now hey talk here's the thing

204
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:18,690
would at least have what if he

205
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:20,310
doesn't give a shit all the dads

206
00:07:20,371 --> 00:07:22,740
already that's what it sounded like because

207
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,940
all he has to do is read

208
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:26,640
the batting order of the team yeah

209
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:28,230
and it's like the juicy that happened

210
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:29,970
i'm sure you get paid i think

211
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:32,130
it's like three hundred million dollars i

212
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:33,900
want this with this jaw the stadium

213
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,520
announcer for the pittsburgh pirates three hundred

214
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,860
million dollars a game pits okay yeah

215
00:07:37,868 --> 00:07:39,630
you're good yearly i have to say

216
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:41,640
i'm glad their mascot isn't a pirate

217
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,470
because that would be dumb well i

218
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,090
think the weekend time they went to

219
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,770
canoes with the players with me

220
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:48,780
because it's like yeah yeah he just

221
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:50,070
people being like hey pirates

222
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:54,090
oh hira hey come on out to

223
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:56,310
the field people are but then he

224
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:58,380
would also be ah all of you

225
00:07:58,384 --> 00:08:00,090
pirates come on that's what i'm saying

226
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:01,500
it got too confusing like the mascot

227
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,700
was always coming out no but he

228
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:03,930
should come out whereas he's supposed to

229
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:05,940
be just in the dugout he's up

230
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:07,290
in the stands is me like company

231
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:09,090
but man he's he's own tree to

232
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:11,221
the sciences the field isn't written that's

233
00:08:11,221 --> 00:08:11,280
how

234
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:12,720
yeah up there yeah i'm sure yes

235
00:08:12,724 --> 00:08:14,400
i thought they were like combs like

236
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,140
phantom billion opera there's gotta know but

237
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:17,250
isn't it like he should be coming

238
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:18,720
up like everyone sees him coming like

239
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:20,310
he walks right up but everyone's like

240
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:22,800
yay yes that's why they changed it

241
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,090
from a pirate because people were like

242
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:25,080
my booty

243
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:28,200
i just mean if he's coming from

244
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,060
the field into the stands it's like

245
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:31,470
you want to see him enter yeah

246
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:33,300
exactly it doesn't pop up from behind

247
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:34,230
but i think he does do that

248
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:34,860
for fun too

249
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:41,580

00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:36,790
with wine maya it's fine i'll find

340
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:37,840
my watch i don't know if we've

341
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,400

of of the quiet place woodchucks oh

528
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:21,640
i just finished watching the show on

529
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,590
netflix called sweet tooth have you seen

530
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:25,600
this yeah based on the comic wants

531
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:26,530
me to walk you and i have

532
00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:27,850
another theory that has like a dog

533
00:17:27,850 --> 00:17:30,850
face it there so there's a little

534
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:32,410
baby he's got a deer face you're

535
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:33,340
okay there's all these high

536
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:35,500
hybrids born behind so they put makeup

537
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:38,320
or maybe cg all these babies to

538
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,520
think like humans and i heard they

539
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,680
put them through surgery to look at

540
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,860
no little babies they made them have

541
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:47,590
surgery to look like these animals and

542
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:49,030
then go but i watched it and

543
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:51,100
then the paycheck for acting wouldn't even

544
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:53,500
cover the surgery so they could

545
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:54,993
nt afford to get changed back did

546
00:17:54,993 --> 00:17:56,920
they even get tapped hard lead though

547
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:58,600
so that would never be in the

548
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:01,660
you know they'll never be unionized i

549
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:02,740
want to ask if you've seen the

550
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:03,310
goop show

551
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:08,498
what that is that's the coin of

552
00:18:08,498 --> 00:18:10,180
the new culture when an auto show

553
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:13,060
where people are having sexual issues in

554
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:15,250

00:24:43,935 --> 00:24:46,245

00:24:46,245 --> 00:24:47,505

and topics childbirth um i had a

742
00:24:50,085 --> 00:24:53,265
baby childbirth um but which makes me

743
00:24:53,265 --> 00:24:54,675
think of the one hundred collect commercial

744
00:24:54,675 --> 00:24:56,415
i had a baby it's boring we

745
00:24:56,415 --> 00:24:58,845
had okay good but it's a girl

746
00:24:59,235 --> 00:25:02,055
um and so it's the opposite of

747
00:25:02,055 --> 00:25:03,975
one eight hundred collect it's yes

748
00:25:03,975 --> 00:25:05,595
yes it's what's the other one it's

749
00:25:05,595 --> 00:25:06,975
like the evil one eight hundred electrum

750
00:25:07,035 --> 00:25:08,595
oh yeah even the starter guy going

751
00:25:08,595 --> 00:25:11,925
around yeah anyway um yeah i had

752
00:25:11,925 --> 00:25:14,385
a baby it was really intent of

753
00:25:14,385 --> 00:25:17,385
it yeah and and i will say

754
00:25:17,745 --> 00:25:19,755
what's the url know it now like

755
00:25:20,085 --> 00:25:22,785
wow it was it was it what

756
00:25:22,785 --> 00:25:24,135
you expected it to be

757
00:25:24,165 --> 00:25:25,755
where you've fully prepared or did you

758
00:25:25,755 --> 00:25:27,105
get in there and you're like holy

759
00:25:27,105 --> 00:25:29,085
fucking shit this is no it hurt

760
00:25:29,085 --> 00:25:31,245
more than i could ever imagine and

761
00:25:31,245 --> 00:25:32,955
i think the what did it what

762
00:25:32,955 --> 00:25:34,665
did it feel like like if there

763
00:25:34,665 --> 00:25:35,925
was a pain that you could liken

764
00:25:35,925 --> 00:25:37,365
it to i honestly couldn't compare it

765
00:25:37,365 --> 00:25:38,475
to anything it was the most pain

766
00:25:38,475 --> 00:25:39,795
i've ever been in my entire life

767
00:25:39,795 --> 00:25:43,125
really the contractions were extremely painful i

768
00:25:43,125 --> 00:25:44,055
didn't understand

769
00:25:44,475 --> 00:25:47,145
that those would hurt so much you

770
00:25:47,145 --> 00:25:48,765
just thought they would maybe be discomfort

771
00:25:48,765 --> 00:25:51,135
yeah more like like shit didn't happening

772
00:25:51,135 --> 00:25:52,545
or something but it was like i

773
00:25:52,545 --> 00:25:54,855
couldn't even see so i was like

774
00:25:55,035 --> 00:25:56,625
you couldn't see i couldn't open my

775
00:25:56,625 --> 00:25:58,455
eyes i was i had to do

776
00:25:58,455 --> 00:26:00,435
a lot it's different yeah i could

777
00:26:00,435 --> 00:26:02,025
see but i chose not to i

778
00:26:02,055 --> 00:26:04,455
went blind i had a doula and

779
00:26:04,665 --> 00:26:05,955
that is a person you're not familiar

780
00:26:05,955 --> 00:26:08,535
who helps a woman through childbirth and

781
00:26:08,535 --> 00:26:10,035
so it was i didn't want to

782
00:26:10,035 --> 00:26:11,715
get one i honestly i think maybe

783
00:26:11,715 --> 00:26:13,545
it's a midwest like mentality or something

784
00:26:13,545 --> 00:26:15,345
but i just do with my sango

785
00:26:15,735 --> 00:26:16,935
zandt your jacket

786
00:26:18,135 --> 00:26:20,805
xantia your baby coming out of your

787
00:26:20,805 --> 00:26:22,305
i knew i'd never heard of anyone

788
00:26:22,305 --> 00:26:24,165
doing that until i moved here right

789
00:26:24,165 --> 00:26:25,425
and so it felt like a little

790
00:26:25,815 --> 00:26:28,095
unnecessarily cheating it just felt like i

791
00:26:28,095 --> 00:26:29,235
just didn't even know why i would

792
00:26:29,235 --> 00:26:32,325
want that but my friend jonathan silverman

793
00:26:32,325 --> 00:26:33,855
who i worked with on good girls

794
00:26:34,095 --> 00:26:35,355
really convinced me to get a duel

795
00:26:35,355 --> 00:26:36,615
and he helped connect me to somebody

796
00:26:36,615 --> 00:26:38,055
because his wife used one and that

797
00:26:38,325 --> 00:26:39,315
they thought it was just so much

798
00:26:39,765 --> 00:26:41,085
it was so amazing and it really

799
00:26:41,085 --> 00:26:43,515
was because she helped me through the

800
00:26:43,515 --> 00:26:44,955
entire process and so i was like

801
00:26:44,985 --> 00:26:46,275
in a lot of pain but just

802
00:26:46,275 --> 00:26:48,195
having her there kind of like talking

803
00:26:48,195 --> 00:26:49,545
to me and like guiding me in

804
00:26:49,605 --> 00:26:51,825
to shop with the forums um like

was wondering what was happening because i

848
00:28:19,305 --> 00:28:20,685
was lying in time yeah it was

849
00:28:20,685 --> 00:28:23,475
sort of like maybe lauren's not announcing

850
00:28:23,475 --> 00:28:25,065
what's going down or i don't know

851
00:28:25,065 --> 00:28:26,205
but i didn't want to check in

852
00:28:26,205 --> 00:28:28,155
and yeah okay some weird was happening

853
00:28:28,185 --> 00:28:29,505
so i'm looking at my calendar then

854
00:28:29,505 --> 00:28:30,315
looking at my phone and

855
00:28:30,435 --> 00:28:32,985
going back and forth yeah every ten

856
00:28:32,985 --> 00:28:35,115
seconds yeah yeah yeah and i fell

857
00:28:35,115 --> 00:28:35,745
asleep standing up

858
00:28:38,055 --> 00:28:39,795
like a bat well yeah like a

859
00:28:39,795 --> 00:28:42,075
bit upside down so she told it

860
00:28:42,315 --> 00:28:43,875
because basically i was like checking in

861
00:28:43,875 --> 00:28:44,835
with her while this was happening over

862
00:28:44,835 --> 00:28:46,725
the weekend she was like the date

863
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:48,885
like i was i scheduled an induction

864
00:28:48,885 --> 00:28:49,965
because i was like at a certain

865
00:28:49,965 --> 00:28:51,015
point you don't want to go too

866
00:28:51,015 --> 00:28:53,595
far right but there's some cons to

867
00:28:53,595 --> 00:28:54,945
doing inductions too so i was kind

868
00:28:54,945 --> 00:28:56,535
of like not sure if i want

869
00:28:56,535 --> 00:28:57,015
to do it but

870
00:28:57,645 --> 00:28:58,965
i scheduled one and then i the

871
00:28:58,965 --> 00:29:00,975
day before actually went into labor i

872
00:29:01,005 --> 00:29:03,135

873
00:29:03,135 --> 00:29:04,845

you they don't tell you there's a

993
00:33:15,565 --> 00:33:17,546

00:33:17,546 --> 00:33:18,535
like vinaigrette like

995
00:33:18,565 --> 00:33:20,635

00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:42,175
you he at the time i was

1008
00:33:42,175 --> 00:33:43,345
letting him sleep in because i was

1009
00:33:43,345 --> 00:33:45,955
like babies coming high he's gonna be

1010
00:33:45,955 --> 00:33:47,245
up all night and i don't want

00:36:12,895 --> 00:36:15,595
around and watch this i never really

1092
00:36:15,625 --> 00:36:16,855
thought much of it until i baby

1093
00:36:16,855 --> 00:36:19,285

1094
00:36:19,645 --> 00:36:21,295

grown wool

1096
00:36:21,895 --> 00:36:25,525
woman or child she dressed your bonnet

1097
00:36:25,645 --> 00:36:27,085
and she didn't want her baby to

1098
00:36:27,085 --> 00:36:28,525
see a screen until she was one

1099
00:36:28,525 --> 00:36:30,235
and i so i was never letting

1100
00:36:30,235 --> 00:36:31,225
her look at the tv of course

1101
00:36:31,585 --> 00:36:33,151

and she helped him to it was

1135
00:37:32,575 --> 00:37:33,835

1137
00:37:35,995 --> 00:37:37,525
like this sit down shut up kind

1138
00:37:37,525 --> 00:37:38,665
of yeah one point she was like

1139
00:37:38,665 --> 00:37:40,075
you need to step away she's getting

1140
00:37:40,165 --> 00:37:41,725

trying to help me but i was

1142
00:37:42,835 --> 00:37:43,855
starting to annoy but i was being

1143
00:37:43,855 --> 00:37:45,475
really nice the whole time i that

1144
00:37:45,505 --> 00:37:46,615
should be made very clear that i

1145
00:37:46,615 --> 00:37:48,355
was i never stand ever did the

1146
00:37:48,355 --> 00:37:50,305
whole there was like a hobby i

1147
00:37:50,305 --> 00:37:51,775
was like real does not cause we

1148
00:37:51,775 --> 00:37:53,095
have a routine about i don't think

1149
00:37:53,095 --> 00:37:53,755
women in labor

1150
00:37:55,075 --> 00:37:57,475
i know but i was very nice

1151
00:37:57,475 --> 00:37:59,335
the entire time i really firmly believe

1152
00:37:59,335 --> 00:38:00,475
that but at certain points she could

1153
00:38:00,475 --> 00:38:01,375
tell that i was getting a little

1154
00:38:01,375 --> 00:38:03,835
agitated with whatever like i was doing

1155
00:38:03,835 --> 00:38:06,138
been rubbing my shoulder oh okay that

1156
00:38:06,145 --> 00:38:07,105
was kind of like not right now

1157
00:38:07,105 --> 00:38:08,545
like because sometimes that was good and

1158
00:38:08,545 --> 00:38:10,015
sometimes it wasn't good right right right

1159
00:38:10,075 --> 00:38:12,265
um but yeah and it went on

1160
00:38:12,265 --> 00:38:14,065
for hours and hours and then ultimately

1161
00:38:14,095 --> 00:38:14,935
so you were in the hospice

1162
00:38:14,935 --> 00:38:16,885
all for hours and hours yes the

1163
00:38:16,885 --> 00:38:19,465
labor was total it was twelve hours

1164
00:38:19,465 --> 00:38:22,105
until she was wow for three hours

1165
00:38:22,105 --> 00:38:23,725
of pushing do you know when people

1166
00:38:23,755 --> 00:38:24,685
when i would hear that when i

1167
00:38:24,685 --> 00:38:25,825
was a kid like i was in

1168
00:38:25,825 --> 00:38:28,765
labor for eighteen hours i always pictured

1169
00:38:28,765 --> 00:38:30,535
it all happen all taking place in

1170
00:38:30,535 --> 00:38:33,413
the hospital yeah but yeah not total

1171
00:38:33,446 --> 00:38:34,735
it's like from the moment you start

1172
00:38:34,735 --> 00:38:35,095
going to leave

1173
00:38:35,156 --> 00:38:36,625
you could be anywhere and that could

1174
00:38:36,925 --> 00:38:38,215
do they deal with you i don't

1175
00:38:38,215 --> 00:38:40,465
like don't even bother us unless it's

1176
00:38:41,095 --> 00:38:42,595
ah or do they say they let

1177
00:38:42,595 --> 00:38:45,025
me in because sometimes they want people

1178
00:38:45,025 --> 00:38:46,135
to wait go back home because it's

1179
00:38:46,135 --> 00:38:47,875
like too soon or something but i

1180
00:38:47,875 --> 00:38:49,465
was like unable to walk the second

1181
00:38:49,465 --> 00:38:50,725
i got in there but it was

1182
00:38:50,755 --> 00:38:51,985
it still took a long time but

1183
00:38:51,985 --> 00:38:53,305

1184
00:38:53,305 --> 00:38:55,255
take a shit honestly uh

1185
00:38:55,255 --> 00:38:58,855
um no it doesn't feel like you

1186
00:38:58,945 --> 00:39:00,535
don't think they do say to push

1187
00:39:00,535 --> 00:39:01,795
us if you're taking as if i

1188
00:39:01,795 --> 00:39:02,755

1198
00:39:18,835 --> 00:39:20,155

stomach or just feel like kicking the

1200
00:39:21,835 --> 00:39:24,175

vagina and butt and everything like really

1203
00:39:29,605 --> 00:39:31,405

1204
00:39:31,405 --> 00:39:33,655

get roles in like it was like

1208
00:39:38,485 --> 00:39:39,985
i then and they were happening every

1209
00:39:39,985 --> 00:39:40,795
couple minutes so i'd have like a

1210
00:39:40,795 --> 00:39:42,685
couple minutes of nothing and that's like

1211
00:39:42,865 --> 00:39:44,275
oh here comes it's like horror it's

1212
00:39:44,275 --> 00:39:45,835
horrible and you still and you still

1213
00:39:45,835 --> 00:39:47,215
remember it because they say like if

1214
00:39:47,215 --> 00:39:48,565
you ever have a second baby it's

1215
00:39:48,565 --> 00:39:50,965
like your mind just will honestly during

1216
00:39:50,965 --> 00:39:52,735
it i was thinking how could anyone

1217
00:39:52,735 --> 00:39:54,115
do this more than once i i

1218
00:39:54,145 --> 00:39:55,645
literally was like this is crazy and

1219
00:39:55,645 --> 00:39:55,735
then

1220
00:39:56,245 --> 00:39:58,045
later in it i was thinking oh

1221
00:39:58,045 --> 00:39:59,095
my god people give birth like in

1222
00:39:59,095 --> 00:40:00,685
the woods and they have nobody around

1223
00:40:00,685 --> 00:40:01,315
like i don't know what i was

1224
00:40:01,315 --> 00:40:02,215
thinking about but i was just like

1225
00:40:02,575 --> 00:40:03,895
i like i wish i'm like me

1226
00:40:03,955 --> 00:40:05,215
i can do this like i was

1227
00:40:05,215 --> 00:40:06,715
just like trying to psych myself um

1228
00:40:06,745 --> 00:40:09,265
and then like afterwards i was like

1229
00:40:09,295 --> 00:40:10,765
i could do it again it's really

1230
00:40:10,765 --> 00:40:12,565
weird really it's like a weird mind

1231
00:40:12,565 --> 00:40:14,155
really yeah because you like forget everything

1232
00:40:14,155 --> 00:40:15,895
so would you do an epidural

1233
00:40:15,895 --> 00:40:16,915
for the second time in why no

1234
00:40:16,915 --> 00:40:20,215
epidural the first i was interested in

1235
00:40:20,215 --> 00:40:22,045
not using one when i took my

1236
00:40:22,195 --> 00:40:23,935
doula because yeah well i just was

1237
00:40:23,935 --> 00:40:25,465
like i'm kind of afraid of the

1238
00:40:25,675 --> 00:40:28,825
needle going into my spine oh um

1239
00:40:28,825 --> 00:40:30,265
but i have a sensitive spine i

1240
00:40:30,265 --> 00:40:31,585
was just a little i'd heard a

1241
00:40:31,585 --> 00:40:33,085
story that kind of made me nervous

1242
00:40:33,085 --> 00:40:34,825
about it oh really and so but

1243
00:40:34,825 --> 00:40:35,605
it was just in my head a

1244
00:40:35,605 --> 00:40:36,018
little bit but

1245
00:40:36,055 --> 00:40:37,525
as a woman who were basically they

1246
00:40:37,585 --> 00:40:38,815
if someone i know they did it

1247
00:40:38,815 --> 00:40:40,975
wrong and that but she didn't know

1248
00:40:40,975 --> 00:40:42,385
that and then she had this headache

1249
00:40:42,385 --> 00:40:45,265
that was like insane for days and

1250
00:40:45,265 --> 00:40:46,735
then when she finally went back to

1251
00:40:46,735 --> 00:40:48,085
the hospital they figured out that it

1252
00:40:48,085 --> 00:40:49,465
was like there was a leak or

1253
00:40:49,465 --> 00:40:52,375
something yeah she missed the spot basically

1254
00:40:52,465 --> 00:40:54,295
i there's a story i heard about

1255
00:40:54,295 --> 00:40:55,885
a woman and that's why we're ribbon

1256
00:40:55,885 --> 00:40:56,185
around me

1257
00:40:57,475 --> 00:40:59,455
yeah you don't want your head to

1258
00:40:59,455 --> 00:41:03,025
just fall exactly would yeah anyway so

1259
00:41:03,025 --> 00:41:04,555
at a certain point anyway i know

1260
00:41:04,555 --> 00:41:05,515
i'm just gonna tell you that i

1261
00:41:05,545 --> 00:41:06,895
did say to my doula i'm interested

1262
00:41:06,895 --> 00:41:07,735
in that but i can't imagine i

1263
00:41:07,735 --> 00:41:10,195
would ever not have an epidural i'm

1264
00:41:10,195 --> 00:41:12,265
just furious like if you didn't know

1265
00:41:12,265 --> 00:41:13,465
i mean the first time i meeting

1266
00:41:13,465 --> 00:41:15,235
with her and i was like she

1267
00:41:15,235 --> 00:41:16,225
asked me like all my opinions and

1268
00:41:16,225 --> 00:41:17,005
all these things and i was

1269
00:41:17,035 --> 00:41:18,565
like that's intriguing to me but i

1270
00:41:18,565 --> 00:41:20,245
don't think of myself as somebody who

1271
00:41:20,485 --> 00:41:22,525
avoids medication i can't imagine that i

1272
00:41:22,525 --> 00:41:24,775
would do that and it st sounds

1273
00:41:24,775 --> 00:41:27,295
really hard now the pain is like

1274
00:41:27,865 --> 00:41:28,765
this is what i've heard it's like

1275
00:41:28,765 --> 00:41:30,385
if you drop a remote control on

1276
00:41:30,385 --> 00:41:31,675
your foot you're just wearing socks

1277
00:41:32,905 --> 00:41:34,135
it's like when you step on a

1278
00:41:34,135 --> 00:41:36,625
lego and then walk into the foot

1279
00:41:36,625 --> 00:41:37,195
of your bed

1280
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:43,889
it's like blocking your shins barking you

1281
00:41:43,917 --> 00:41:46,585
never know what if you step on

1282
00:41:46,585 --> 00:41:48,355
your bed and then walk into a

1283
00:41:48,355 --> 00:41:51,025
logo that would hurt yes step into

1306
00:42:33,925 --> 00:42:35,635

1308
00:42:38,305 --> 00:42:39,805

trying to figure out what the show

1312
00:42:45,685 --> 00:42:47,335
was right i was like because they're

1313
00:42:47,335 --> 00:42:48,475
like it's based on this

1314
00:42:48,475 --> 00:42:51,655
the english format and it's very popular

1315
00:42:51,655 --> 00:42:53,575
in england um and they were like

1316
00:42:53,575 --> 00:42:54,985
we don't know how it's gonna do

1317
00:42:55,015 --> 00:42:56,545
yeah but you know it's very popular

1318
00:42:56,545 --> 00:42:57,685

1609
00:52:53,895 --> 00:52:56,595
called bad judge one person i e

1610
00:52:56,625 --> 00:52:58,845
the judge is ill prepared for a

1611
00:52:58,845 --> 00:53:00,885
case they are presiding over they entered

1612
00:53:00,885 --> 00:53:02,115
the courtroom and have to figure out

1613
00:53:02,115 --> 00:53:04,695
what crime is being tried based off

1614
00:53:04,695 --> 00:53:06,045
an improv done by the

1615
00:53:06,135 --> 00:53:09,375
other to lawyer slash witness prosecutor slash

1616
00:53:09,405 --> 00:53:11,955
defendant etc the the people that populate

1617
00:53:11,955 --> 00:53:15,345
the courtroom sketch artists not helpful who

1618
00:53:15,345 --> 00:53:16,965
are trying to be vague so as

1619
00:53:16,965 --> 00:53:18,045
not to give it away but are

1620
00:53:18,045 --> 00:53:20,985
having realistic trial conversation though the crime

1621
00:53:20,985 --> 00:53:23,205
can be ridiculous gotta be really realistic

1622
00:53:23,205 --> 00:53:26,265
though yes it has to sound like

1623
00:53:26,265 --> 00:53:30,285
like authentic courtroom jargon okay got it

1624
00:53:30,435 --> 00:53:31,635
are you going to be the judge

1625
00:53:31,725 --> 00:53:33,045
the bad i don't even know i

1626
00:53:33,045 --> 00:53:34,905
just read the thing i feel like

1627
00:53:34,905 --> 00:53:38,385
i wasn't retaining it i i think

1628
00:53:38,385 --> 00:53:40,605
i got we've done similar things basically

1629
00:53:40,605 --> 00:53:43,485
you can't say directly what the judge

1630
00:53:43,545 --> 00:53:45,345
if the judge ever gets used too

1631
00:53:45,375 --> 00:53:46,305
big of words

1632
00:53:46,455 --> 00:53:47,622
you have to do this to get

1633
00:53:47,634 --> 00:53:50,055
before it's gonna go well yeah so

1634
00:53:50,055 --> 00:53:51,015
if you are you have to be

1635
00:53:51,015 --> 00:53:52,155
vague about it so if a judge

1636
00:53:52,155 --> 00:53:54,915
guesses oh the games oh yes and

1637
00:53:54,915 --> 00:53:56,085
and one of us tells the other

1638
00:53:56,085 --> 00:53:58,005
one what the crime yeah yeah oh

1639
00:53:58,005 --> 00:53:59,145
look i'll be the judge since i

1640
00:53:59,175 --> 00:54:01,065
think i know okay okay and then

1641
00:54:01,095 --> 00:54:03,675
the new guy's crime o texto crime

1642
00:54:04,035 --> 00:54:05,745
please don't do the crime unless you're

1643
00:54:05,745 --> 00:54:06,585
