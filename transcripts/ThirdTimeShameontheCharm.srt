the same time like this dog ran

318
00:11:15,575 --> 00:11:16,055
away from the

319
00:11:16,085 --> 00:11:18,785
fires from hawaii has that kind of

320
00:11:18,785 --> 00:11:20,555
since huddled on foam

321
00:11:21,785 --> 00:11:23,068
oh i thought it was here but

322
00:11:23,254 --> 00:11:24,545
you know the fires there and you

323
00:11:24,545 --> 00:11:26,885
know what if a dog cast away

324
00:11:27,485 --> 00:11:29,195
had like a tennis ball that was

325
00:11:29,195 --> 00:11:29,765
it's wilson

326
00:11:30,515 --> 00:11:33,455
that's proportionately smaller yeah and it just

327
00:11:33,455 --> 00:11:35,405
kind of constantly chased it and finally

328
00:11:35,435 --> 00:11:37,475
chased it off the island and what

329
00:11:37,475 --> 00:11:38,735
if it gave it gave up on

330
00:11:38,735 --> 00:11:40,355
the ball what if a dog gave

331
00:11:40,355 --> 00:11:42,785
birth to a ball oh my god

332
00:11:42,995 --> 00:11:43,985
this is a movie it was a

333
00:11:44,015 --> 00:11:46,325
golf ball and it talked and it

334
00:11:46,325 --> 00:11:49,715
said tiger was my dad so tigerwoods

335
00:11:49,715 --> 00:11:50,615
had sex with the dog

336
00:11:50,675 --> 00:11:52,805
yeah the dog gave birth to alcohol

337
00:11:53,855 --> 00:11:56,165
that makes sense his seem at this

338
00:11:56,165 --> 00:11:57,065
point is golf balls

339
00:11:58,415 --> 00:11:59,495
it's as big as cool yeah let's

340
00:11:59,495 --> 00:12:01,235
golf tees and it makes sense like

341
00:12:01,235 --> 00:12:02,465
if they gave birth to a big

342
00:12:02,465 --> 00:12:02,975

417
00:14:28,655 --> 00:14:31,055

430
00:14:56,075 --> 00:14:59,225

yeah i don't want to give them

681
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:43,050
unrealistic expectation yeah that when you're like

forty you grow five inch yeah so

683
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:47,070

00:24:00,279 --> 00:24:01,800
business or whatever okay so it's a

692
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:02,970
guy he used to work with why

693
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:04,890

going in both edit with the lascaux

698
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:14,220

699
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:15,720
other words yeah like he he opened

700
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:16,770
his own business oh this is a

701
00:24:16,770 --> 00:24:18,750
guy that that the father used to

702
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:20,310
work with right okay so then the

703
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:21,840
preview you're saying why did he open

704
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,400
with he grew five and yeah like

705
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,990
what how were those connected it is

706
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:26,730
the most interesting thing i would just

707
00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:28,380
leave it at that right oh he

708
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:29,280
grew five inches

709
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,127
one with the end was saying like

710
00:24:32,136 --> 00:24:34,410
i would say he grew five inches

711
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,420
but i think there was something that

712
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:38,040
needed to be explained about the rest

713
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,750
of that one hundred percent but the

714
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:41,280
the daughter seemed to have no further

715
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,750
quest she was fine with it yeah

716
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:45,990
he grew five inches got a tablesaw

717
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:47,745
and opened a business if you know

718
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:49,830
the update from when he leaves letter

719
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:50,520
saw him when he was

720
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:51,630
twenty eight we haven't seen him in

721
00:24:51,630 --> 00:24:52,980
twenty years but what happened how well

722
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:54,210
he grew five inches you got a

723
00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:55,380
table to open a business that's all

724
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:56,460
you need to know i mean this

725
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:59,670
time this child was small so how

726
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:02,520
how old could henry have been yeah

727
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,470
that the child would remember who henry

728
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:06,990
was right would inquire whatever happened to

729
00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:10,530
him what happened yeah this feels like

730
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:12,360
what's the business that you opened with

731
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:13,290
just a tablespoon

732
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:16,319
i don't know tablesaw here what if

733
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:19,290
it is a children's book what if

734
00:25:19,290 --> 00:25:21,840
it is a boring children's book the

735
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,340
guy who bought one table no it's

736
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:24,900

bought one table so any has no

739
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:30,118
prospects and then the story ends and

740
00:25:30,118 --> 00:25:31,890
then the daughter goes whatever happened to

741
00:25:31,890 --> 00:25:34,140

i like she stopped checking the day

753
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:56,370

this up now

757
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:06,210

758
00:26:06,210 --> 00:26:08,280
part of the weekend for you i

759
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:10,410

right now he's continues to grow and

766
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:28,200
as a buzzer rabbi i think my

767
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,030
most interesting thing is that i went

768
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:31,710
to a two year old's birthday party

769
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:34,590

770
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:37,500

00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:39,630

really get excited about the garbage dragon

799
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:36,660
do you think that's why oscar so

800
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:39,300
grouchy because lobbies are always trying to

801
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:41,460
insert into kids and it's like i

802
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:42,840
wish kids were not so interested in

803
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:44,910
my life that should be part of

804
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:46,560
his thing yeah because i don't look

805
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,940
it would ask the crowd to help

806
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:49,260
you count or was he just a

807
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:50,790
guy who was like irritate

808
00:27:50,843 --> 00:27:52,050
and he would teach you about growing

809
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,720
account is the cow sure but you

810
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,400
know how almost everything in sesame street

811
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,570
has to have some sort of lesson

812
00:27:57,570 --> 00:27:59,160
attached to it his was like don't

813
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:01,470

814
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:02,842

so i guess it was just like

817
00:28:07,170 --> 00:28:09,480

818
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:12,030

sure it's at night though because i

844
00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:59,850
remember this it could have been during

845
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:01,650
the day and bert was like taking

846
00:29:01,650 --> 00:29:04,470
a nap if still you know what

847
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:04,710
i mean

848
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:07,380
that's rude but but how are you

849
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:08,910
to know your if your roommate is

850
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:10,410
taking a nap if the roommate doesn't

851
00:29:10,410 --> 00:29:11,550
say like by the way i'm in

852
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:13,110
my room how do we know that

853
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:15,270

854
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:16,590
room they have beds right next to

each other that's true it's right yeah

856
00:29:17,970 --> 00:29:20,310

857
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:21,330
wants to play the trumpet he's got

858
00:29:21,330 --> 00:29:22,800
a peek inside their bedroom and say

859
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:24,120
i kind of think anybody who has

860
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:24,450

861
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:26,700

865
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:34,980
in this situation yeah he's he's wrong

866
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,110

940
00:32:14,510 --> 00:32:16,550
we should create a really missed opportunity

941
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:17,420
what if we create a cloud of

942
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:19,880
sentient bag of chips yes

birthday month yeah they use it as

998
00:34:09,290 --> 00:34:11,330
an excuse for like terrible behavior as

999
00:34:11,330 --> 00:34:12,950
well yeah well because it can do

1000
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:14,330
whatever the fuck they will this is

1001
00:34:14,330 --> 00:34:17,390
straight out of vanderpump rules really oh

1002
00:34:17,390 --> 00:34:19,730
okay it always tell us people in

1003
00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:20,570
the early is

1004
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:22,790
near the site few seasons

1005
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:26,150
question here

1006
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:30,380
in the first few seasons especially there's

1007
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:32,390
a lot of episodes that center around

1008
00:34:32,390 --> 00:34:34,790
people's birthdays and how important they are

1009
00:34:34,790 --> 00:34:36,680
and these people are in their late

1010
00:34:36,830 --> 00:34:38,480
twenties well they don't i mean this

1011
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,490
reminds me of like it's a it's

1012
00:34:40,490 --> 00:34:41,780
the kind of thing and cool i've

1013
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:43,190
had a few of these when we

1014
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:45,380
were dating of like up until you're

1015
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:47,360
about twenty three or so

1016
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:49,070
nothing like you're when you have your

1017
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:50,870
birthday it's time to invite every single

1018
00:34:50,870 --> 00:34:52,520
person you know to start i think

1019
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:54,440
past twenty three i think that goes

1020
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:56,600
up until a few years before thirty

1021
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:58,910
really that people still do that yeah

1022
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:00,230
and now it's like when people do

1023
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:03,020
that after thirty for just like a

1024
00:35:03,050 --> 00:35:05,300
random birthday not like a milestone yeah

1025
00:35:05,330 --> 00:35:06,680
what are you doing come on man

1026
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:07,520

00:35:07,610 --> 00:35:10,040
eden dead real like i didn't do

1028
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:12,320

1032
00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:19,490

yeah oh yeah and admit it now

1041
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:33,560
and then everyone has to figure out

1042
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:35,090
how to split the check because everyone

1043
00:35:35,090 --> 00:35:37,010

schneider and that set them off on

1121
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:31,670
a thing where they basically realised how

1122
00:38:31,670 --> 00:38:33,560
amazing the show is this so now

1123
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:34,670

00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:36,530

1126
00:38:36,530 --> 00:38:38,180

1127
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:41,690
a family in macon georgia or not

1128
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:43,430

1129
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:45,530
cairo but it smelled like cairo wow

1130
00:38:45,830 --> 00:38:47,420
georgia k row its really small town

1131
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:50,360
and it's um and the family is

1132
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:53,840
very sheltered and religious but then the

1133
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,760
kids you're basically catching this for

1134
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:56,840
only were like the kids are getting

1135
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:58,490
beat teens and some of them are

1136
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:01,040
venturing into the world and some are

1137
00:39:01,070 --> 00:39:02,930
you see how naive they are and

1138
00:39:02,930 --> 00:39:03,770
then you see some of them trying

1139
00:39:03,770 --> 00:39:04,790
to be a little bad and then

1140
00:39:04,799 --> 00:39:06,020
one of them still really religious like

1141
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:07,310
praise in a closet for all of

1142
00:39:07,310 --> 00:39:09,620
them and those the hand movement you

1143
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:11,750
were doing you were like whipping just

1144
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:13,910
sort of souls you're doing okay and

1145
00:39:13,910 --> 00:39:15,890
then um over

1146
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,960
time you see that the parents then

1147
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,400
get divorced which is like the tapping

1148
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,196

stun

1696
01:00:32,495 --> 01:00:34,325
true but but the reason i was

1697
01:00:34,325 --> 01:00:35,645
doing it is because no one would

1698
01:00:35,645 --> 01:00:36,725
be able to tell my eyes were

1699
01:00:36,725 --> 01:00:38,255
