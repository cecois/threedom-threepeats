we joke around a lot that's bad

47
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:45,780
that actually works we are outside by

48
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:47,220
the way yeah in case you hear

49
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:51,390
any ambient noise we're outside oh just

50
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:53,070
flew over me yes is that an

51
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:55,560
omen alan crabs tweeted that crows are

52
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,270
getting you know is it alan somebody

53
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,250
no alex bernie tweeted that crows are

54
00:01:59,250 --> 00:01:59,940
getting too big

55
00:02:00,512 --> 00:02:04,050
you agree cruiser gang oh okay to

56
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:06,960
use the alan mcleod of twitter in

57
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,810
my opinion yeah it's a very specific

58
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:12,600
you know i mean like if you

59
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,430
see what he tweets then you understand

60
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:15,960
that it makes sense when you look

61
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,460
weird as hell mcleod tweets but he's

62
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:19,440
not the allan mcleod he would anyway

63
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,482
i bet he feels bad about it

64
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:22,260
is the allan macleod of the icloud

65
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,910

66
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:26,250
one and only high class home the

67
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:27,630
cloud is out there and he had

68
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:29,400
access to all of our icloud so

69
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,200
that would be stressful alan mccoy

70
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:33,060
i trust him i would trust him

71
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:34,470

yeah it was like i'll just buy

146
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:02,760
whatever yeah that sounds like why do

147
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,720
i have this pile up at the

148
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,220
worst way if anyone's ever seen but

149
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:06,330
you know what i've been in that

150
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:07,680
situation where i know where you can

151
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:09,411
find it yes and it fucking sucks

152
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:11,010
sometimes but a specific thing in mind

153
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:12,210
and at the time i was doing

154
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:13,440
enough shows all the time where it

155
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,550
was like oh yeah i can use

156
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:15,360
this wig exam

157
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,800
likely i'll turn it around and do

158
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,999
it this way or whatever now shows

159
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,590
are over so what's the issue exactly

160
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:21,540
yeah entertainment is over this is not

161
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:23,010
entertainment by the way speak we know

162
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:24,630
we've never said it was we never

163
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:27,270
said why not but we're moving into

164
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:28,440
like infotainment

165
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:30,600
i did want to add health and

166
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,730
wellness i got a lot about vitamins

167
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:33,750
and a lot about crystals i want

168
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,580
to talk about okay did you know

169
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:36,900
william howard taft had to have a

170
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,970
special bathtub built for him that's info

171
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,270
that's info tainment way why because he

172
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:44,310
was a great big fat man like

173
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,690
use r fattest press though he had

174
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:47,387
a big tub made yet it had

175
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,170
accustomed tub made because of regular

176
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,190
tub would not fit him but about

177
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:51,660
back then everyone was so tight and

178
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:53,430
they all paths also back then they're

179
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:55,380
all to bend there wasn't enough mass

180
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:57,570
production on the scale where they could

181
00:05:57,570 --> 00:05:58,740
go like well a little a little

182
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:01,530
justify us making three thousand of these

183
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:03,330
huge tubs because there were three thousand

184
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:05,310
people who advise wow they probably were

185
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:06,810
there probably were but they just didn't

186
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:08,760
know like where back then we want

187
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:09,360
a tammany

00:10:48,095 --> 00:10:49,115
the hottest people in the world i

00:10:51,245 --> 00:10:52,535
is one of the top people would

319
00:10:52,535 --> 00:10:54,065

320
00:10:54,065 --> 00:10:55,985

wasn't um elementary school probably second grade

389
00:13:19,835 --> 00:13:21,035
my friend and i decided we were

390
00:13:21,035 --> 00:13:23,555
gonna swim in her stand-up shower that

391
00:13:23,555 --> 00:13:24,935
had like a glass door you know

392
00:13:24,965 --> 00:13:26,765
you start like a cartoon you could

393
00:13:26,765 --> 00:13:28,595
fill it up wow so we put

394
00:13:28,595 --> 00:13:30,755
a phone book over the um crack

395
00:13:31,025 --> 00:13:33,455
what do you call it crack know

396
00:13:33,515 --> 00:13:34,655
the part where the water goes down

397
00:13:34,655 --> 00:13:36,245
the drain so yeah the drain so

398
00:13:36,245 --> 00:13:36,545
little

399
00:13:38,015 --> 00:13:39,245
and we've started fill it and it

400
00:13:39,245 --> 00:13:40,565
started we've turned on the water and

401
00:13:40,565 --> 00:13:43,355
we're just like soaking the phone and

402
00:13:43,355 --> 00:13:44,075
then we got in trouble

403
00:13:45,395 --> 00:13:47,585
how far up did it go ah

404
00:13:47,615 --> 00:13:48,755
one millimeter

405
00:13:49,835 --> 00:13:51,065
just made like a puddle in the

406
00:13:51,065 --> 00:13:53,763
shower yeah but i really remember when

407
00:13:53,763 --> 00:13:55,415
that phone book also i couldn't swim

408
00:13:55,415 --> 00:13:56,585
so it was pretty bold thing to

409
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:58,775
be doing so anytime you call anyone

410
00:13:58,835 --> 00:14:00,395
from that phone book would they sound

411
00:14:00,395 --> 00:14:03,485
wet yeah they always thought soaking wet

412
00:14:04,085 --> 00:14:06,575
weight did you oh do you remember

413
00:14:06,575 --> 00:14:08,255
if your plan was to fill it

414
00:14:08,255 --> 00:14:09,755
up to the top yeah we thought

415
00:14:09,755 --> 00:14:09,995
we were going

416
00:14:09,995 --> 00:14:11,795
to swim in it to the top

417
00:14:11,795 --> 00:14:13,775
though not just so you could float

418
00:14:13,775 --> 00:14:14,795
but to all the way all the

419
00:14:14,795 --> 00:14:15,605
way up to the top to where

420
00:14:15,605 --> 00:14:17,225
you would drown it i think i

421
00:14:17,225 --> 00:14:18,785
think this has been removed from the

00:14:18,785 --> 00:14:20,225

i didn't know what to do where

638
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:11,820
he actually goes to singing goes to

639
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:12,210
school

640
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:15,300

641
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:16,830
sex with little girls yeah was he

642
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:18,480
nine hundred supposedly in school where he

643
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,680
was cool and know he was cool

644
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,270
and everyone loves the thing is he

645
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:22,680
was cool everywhere and he had no

646
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,178
problems isn't that a weird move and

647
00:22:24,178 --> 00:22:26,700
i love ferris bueller well he but

648
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:28,020
he did have to get home before

649
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:29,760
he was dealing yeah but just got

650
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,590
a tight tight time his friends have

651
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:33,390
the problems he had no emotions

652
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:34,830
the problem that he had to get

653
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:36,360
over well he had one friend who

654
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:38,070
had problems and then amarin was the

655
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:39,900
girl that he has sex with sometimes

656
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:41,730
yeah but she he was pretend to

657
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:42,890
be her dad waiting outside of the

658
00:22:42,890 --> 00:22:44,190
school that's a little weird but it

659
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:46,320
isn't it strange to have a movie

660
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,450
where a guy like the setup is

661
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:50,100
hey i'm cool and everyone likes me

662
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:51,450
and i want to do this thing

663
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,800
then he does it in the end

664
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:53,550
i'm sure there are

665
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:55,350
more examples of this well but it's

666
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:57,030
also the tension of is he going

667
00:22:57,030 --> 00:22:59,160
to get caught early is downfall because

668
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,780
everywhere he goes it's like a thing

669
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:02,700
you shouldn't do well it's everyone's dream

670
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:04,500

yeah ray well it had the yogurt

755
00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:51,720
part of it this was nineteen eighty

00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,880
five so yogurt was very very big

757
00:25:53,910 --> 00:25:56,220

they were popping up everywhere and i

760
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:04,350
guess they were a relatively cheap way

761
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:06,450
to start a business and and with

762
00:26:06,450 --> 00:26:09,780
a lot of like ah markup on

764
00:26:11,126 --> 00:26:12,985
rice so how much was a yoga

765
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:14,430
two dollars yeah it would be like

766
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:15,720
to back then it would be like

767
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:17,340
even a dollar fifty or whatever you

768
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:19,320
would probably spend twenty five cents on

769
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:21,330
on everything yeah that's that's a profit

770
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:23,430

good you're living the dream it's a

1072
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:51,080
dream you're gonna live reach huh

1073
00:36:52,443 --> 00:36:54,920
huh if i went to a strip

1074
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:57,410
club and then there was something pretty

1075
00:36:57,410 --> 00:36:58,940
ladies doing a dance than you did

1076
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:00,590
which didn't buy it by the way

1077
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,330
their title is going to i was

1078
00:37:02,330 --> 00:37:03,320
the person who gave you all the

1079
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:05,300
money you absolutely were really why do

1080
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:07,010
you think you weren't because coop thinks

1081
00:37:07,010 --> 00:37:08,420
that it was it was our house

1082
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:10,250
person yeah that's going to see him

1083
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:11,132
doing actually you know

1084
00:37:11,390 --> 00:37:13,550
oh you're right yeah that makes sense

1085
00:37:13,550 --> 00:37:15,050
to me yeah that's the thing he

1086
00:37:15,050 --> 00:37:16,610
would know i think you're right yeah

1087
00:37:17,390 --> 00:37:18,980
so then when you said you absolutely

1088
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:21,530
were why did you say that i

1089
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:23,240
absolutely want to share with you

1090
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:26,660
i guess so

1091
00:37:27,590 --> 00:37:28,760
i still sort of think it was

1092
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:30,890
you show me to be you corbyn

1093
00:37:31,010 --> 00:37:31,820
it could i know i could see

1094
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:33,830
mark two maybe we both did yeah

1095
00:37:33,830 --> 00:37:35,750
i think you both that sounds reasonable

1096
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:37,010
that's a compromise but i was going

1097
00:37:37,010 --> 00:37:38,420
to say if you came out next

1098
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,130
i don't know what i would think

1099
00:37:40,370 --> 00:37:42,260
so next it's coed strip club where

1100
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,790
it's like they don't even tell you

1101
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,680
no one announces anything about it there

1102
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:46,730
you think you're going to see pretty

1103
00:37:46,730 --> 00:37:47,720
ladies i do

1104
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:48,860

a lie by trial and error by

1184
00:40:37,250 --> 00:40:37,400
geh

1185
00:40:38,032 --> 00:40:40,190
older and smarter every time they said

1186
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:42,230
that they never actually did come back

1187
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:44,900

we were in there once and we

1190
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:50,930

1191
00:40:50,930 --> 00:40:52,010
just kind of like and she was

1192
00:40:52,010 --> 00:40:53,150
the only cashier we couldn't go to

1193
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:55,520

1194
00:40:55,550 --> 00:40:58,010

1195
00:40:58,010 --> 00:40:58,130

1197
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:01,190
bullies yeah we're over here i can't

1198
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:02,990

1201
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:09,980
in the window we look like losers

1202
00:41:10,910 --> 00:41:12,170
we put a yellow ribbon around the

1203
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:14,180
tree in the yard and our next

1204
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:15,920
but then i was talking to we

1205
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:16,430

00:41:57,770 --> 00:41:57,890
the

1229
00:41:57,950 --> 00:42:00,500
first and most simply a second we're

1230
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:03,440
losing luann ah de la supps on

1231
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:05,510
real housewives of new york okay the

1232
00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:07,850
counter salary cap yeah she's brought up

1233
00:42:07,850 --> 00:42:09,350
a stripper that appeared to the party

1234
00:42:09,350 --> 00:42:11,120
that was shazam an add on and

1235
00:42:11,210 --> 00:42:12,770
which on another show and she was

1236
00:42:12,770 --> 00:42:14,630
a he was really good looking i

1237
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:16,250
really like yeah yeah so she would

1238
00:42:16,250 --> 00:42:17,811
want him to come back um i

1239
00:42:17,811 --> 00:42:18,080
always go

1240
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:19,700
to say because you said stripper gram

1241
00:42:19,730 --> 00:42:20,750
and will eventually get back to what

1242
00:42:20,750 --> 00:42:23,030
you want to talk about it reminded

1243
00:42:23,030 --> 00:42:24,110
me that in high school we had

1244
00:42:24,110 --> 00:42:28,100
this thing called valid grams and what

1245
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:31,220
isn't let's try to guess oh oil

1246
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:33,440
you would give kids value because the

1247
00:42:33,470 --> 00:42:35,435
valentine things you there were a couple

1248
00:42:35,464 --> 00:42:37,280
things that happened you could hire or

1249
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:38,240
basic audioslave

1250
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:39,140
well and you say who you want

1251
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:40,460
to get into and you would pay

1252
00:42:40,460 --> 00:42:42,710
and that sounds like me then you

1253
00:42:42,710 --> 00:42:45,650
would either deliver a shitty delivers which

1254
00:42:45,650 --> 00:42:47,450
is a shame yeah no they would

1255
00:42:47,450 --> 00:42:48,710
just come in and you get handed

1256
00:42:48,710 --> 00:42:50,360
out all your lollipops that you got

1257
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:51,710
i hate you and a yea i

1258
00:42:51,710 --> 00:42:53,210

1261
00:42:57,438 --> 00:42:58,370
just remembered that

1262
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,710
there was also this um love quiz

1263
00:43:00,710 --> 00:43:02,030
you could take and they would tell

1264
00:43:02,030 --> 00:43:03,290
you who your best match was at

1265
00:43:03,290 --> 00:43:07,400

00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:09,680
like oh my god not that guy

1267
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:11,210
or whatever you know like that's very

1268
00:43:11,210 --> 00:43:12,980
weird that shouldn't be something that is

1269
00:43:13,070 --> 00:43:14,510
i can understand the school trying to

1270
00:43:14,510 --> 00:43:16,400
raise money so doing the the first

1271
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,020
thing but the second thing is strange

1272
00:43:18,290 --> 00:43:18,560
old

1273
00:43:18,590 --> 00:43:21,140

you could look them up now maybe

1278
00:43:27,410 --> 00:43:28,970

but it was and is

1299
00:44:24,140 --> 00:44:25,550
it's like a sort of daytime tv

1300
00:44:25,550 --> 00:44:27,290
show or a nighttime to stay time

1301
00:44:27,410 --> 00:44:29,180

was on and we were trying to

1303
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:31,730
reach her cool off and we're trying

1304
00:44:31,730 --> 00:44:33,080
to figure it out because because we

1305
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:34,940
got ben we got dropped in you

1306
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:36,320
know five minutes into it so the

1307
00:44:36,350 --> 00:44:38,780
premise was already explained and then we

1308
00:44:38,780 --> 00:44:40,340
were watching and were like why or

1309
00:44:40,370 --> 00:44:42,020
why is this judge talking now why

1310
00:44:42,050 --> 00:44:43,700
are there three judges ice like one

1311
00:44:43,910 --> 00:44:44,210
one

1312
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:46,610
basically like decided we thought and then

1313
00:44:46,610 --> 00:44:47,690
two more got to talk so we're

1314
00:44:47,690 --> 00:44:48,680
trying to fit and then why is

1315
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:49,880
it called hot bench we couldn't figure

1316
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:51,560
it out and then we got have

1317
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:52,580
something to do we never saw the

1318
00:44:52,580 --> 00:44:55,100
right options how this many popular court

1319
00:44:55,100 --> 00:44:56,900
shows are on tv how can the

1320
00:44:56,900 --> 00:44:59,900
genre improve how about using a three

1321
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:02,060
judge panel that's the concept of hot

1322
00:45:02,060 --> 00:45:04,040
bench created by judge judy scheindlin

1323
00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:06,740
after hearing each case the judges discuss

1324
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:08,750
it amongst themselves before rendering a verdict

1325
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:11,720
the jurists but are not civil litigator

1326
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:13,730
blah blah but they should have that

1327
00:45:13,730 --> 00:45:15,230
in real life considering how bad some

1328
00:45:15,230 --> 00:45:17,000
of these judges are out there can

1329
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,740
you imagine three judges trying to come

1330
00:45:18,740 --> 00:45:20,180
to some sort of consensus if it

1331
00:45:20,180 --> 00:45:23,090
wasn't for money what when they get

1332
00:45:23,090 --> 00:45:24,530

a chair while this guy grinds honor

1402
00:47:40,010 --> 00:47:41,840

1510
00:51:21,161 --> 00:51:23,085
this feature was submitted to us by

1511
00:51:23,805 --> 00:51:27,885
a tv show called hotbed judge judy

1512
00:51:27,885 --> 00:51:30,285
scheindlin here's our technically here's how it's

1513
00:51:30,285 --> 00:51:32,835
going to be one person will be

1514
00:51:32,985 --> 00:51:37,095
the ah the the plaintiff and to

1515
00:51:37,095 --> 00:51:37,725
defend it

1516
00:51:38,865 --> 00:51:40,845
the other two people will be three

1517
00:51:40,875 --> 00:51:43,665
judges now one person has one judge

1518
00:51:43,905 --> 00:51:45,645
and the other person is two judges

1519
00:51:45,855 --> 00:51:47,295
that don't agree with each other i

1520
00:51:47,295 --> 00:51:48,675
love okay and we're going to go

1521
00:51:48,675 --> 00:51:51,195
clockwise with it right oh yes as

1522
00:51:51,195 --> 00:51:53,475
we always do so yeah paul doesn't

1523
00:51:53,475 --> 00:51:56,475
like clockwise i do but i i

1524
00:51:57,045 --> 00:51:58,935
i feel like i can't it's someone

1525
00:51:58,995 --> 00:52:00,915
grantham blocked in the air and then

1526
00:52:00,915 --> 00:52:01,965
when i looked down here i lose

1527
00:52:01,965 --> 00:52:04,139
it it's own grammy now from playing

1528
00:52:04,185 --> 00:52:06,225
clock on the floor every every board

1529
00:52:06,225 --> 00:52:08,685
game little mind is happening to me

1530
00:52:09,105 --> 00:52:10,455
every board game when you're young is

1531
00:52:10,455 --> 00:52:12,405
clockwise so it's like i don't even

1532
00:52:12,435 --> 00:52:14,625
think to suggest counterclockwise anymore it's just

1533
00:52:14,625 --> 00:52:15,855
like oh clockwise but do you know

1534
00:52:15,885 --> 00:52:17,205
why don't you say go to the

1535
00:52:17,205 --> 00:52:19,095
lab was five i think

1536
00:52:19,155 --> 00:52:20,925
saying clockwise is really confusing when you're

1537
00:52:20,925 --> 00:52:22,305
a kid i remember when i didn't

1538
00:52:22,305 --> 00:52:23,445
know how to tell time do you

1539
00:52:24,015 --> 00:52:26,655
oh yes any daily and i share

1540
00:52:26,655 --> 00:52:28,125
a thing that we did not learn

1541
00:52:28,125 --> 00:52:29,145
how to knit both of us did

1542
00:52:29,145 --> 00:52:30,255
not learn how to tell time until

1543
00:52:30,255 --> 00:52:32,745
we were in seventh grade oh that's

1544
00:52:32,745 --> 00:52:34,065
pretty late i think i was in

1545
00:52:34,065 --> 00:52:36,465
it it was terrifying maybe no second

1546
00:52:36,465 --> 00:52:37,845
or third grade i think this is

1547
00:52:37,845 --> 00:52:39,315
back when there there were clock

1548
00:52:39,315 --> 00:52:40,995
x there was nothing about claw yeah

1549
00:52:41,265 --> 00:52:42,915
clocks so you would just drop into

1550
00:52:42,945 --> 00:52:45,105
a circle with your left in damon

1551
00:52:45,165 --> 00:52:46,455
i did not know how to do

1552
00:52:46,455 --> 00:52:48,645
the math of the clock yeah and

1553
00:52:48,675 --> 00:52:50,025
it's not easy tried to teach me

1554
00:52:50,025 --> 00:52:51,255
and i just couldn't get it i

1555
00:52:51,255 --> 00:52:52,485
think i would get anxious about it

1556
00:52:52,725 --> 00:52:54,555
and i couldn't get it and then

1557
00:52:54,585 --> 00:52:55,695
for seventh and when i was in

1558
00:52:55,695 --> 00:52:57,615
seventh grade for christmas my mom got

1559
00:52:57,615 --> 00:52:58,935

1563
00:53:04,035 --> 00:53:07,605
magical show somebody threw a boomerang at

1564
00:53:07,605 --> 00:53:09,945
me in the face and then it

a funny yeah we don't address the

1616
00:54:49,065 --> 00:54:51,315

rule

1623
00:55:00,705 --> 00:55:01,755
so you could see what i have

1624
00:55:01,755 --> 00:55:03,495

1625
00:55:03,525 --> 00:55:05,865

though instead of a secluded here i

1630
00:55:17,055 --> 00:55:17,925
think it's nice

1631
00:55:19,215 --> 00:55:20,865
you don't have to disagree on everything

1632
00:55:21,105 --> 00:55:22,905
okay just because you're the the plaintiff

1633
00:55:23,201 --> 00:55:25,065
to find like the sweater i don't

1634
00:55:25,365 --> 00:55:26,655
and you don't have to disagree on

1635
00:55:26,655 --> 00:55:29,625
everything either okay not okay just

1636
00:55:30,675 --> 00:55:32,865
okay anyway so it says here mister

1637
00:55:32,865 --> 00:55:36,345
rogers that you're suing the defendant mister

1638
00:55:36,345 --> 00:55:36,825
mcfeely

1639
00:55:39,405 --> 00:55:40,245
no relation

1640
00:55:42,135 --> 00:55:43,995
you are a mailman though yes but

1641
00:55:43,995 --> 00:55:46,005
still you're suing him for not delivering

1642
00:55:46,005 --> 00:55:48,645
your mail and your mail specifically that's

1643
00:55:48,645 --> 00:55:50,895
correct he would go to other houses

1644
00:55:50,895 --> 00:55:51,885
