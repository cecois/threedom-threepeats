i'm sorry yeah i'm really sorry no

215
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:20,730
because it doesn't even look at it

216
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:22,590
you just do do well because they

217
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:24,480
see it when you get a draw

218
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,760
driver it shows you their stars and

219
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,260
so i assume they see you don't

220
00:07:28,284 --> 00:07:29,430
look at them yeah i think they

221
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:30,900
do and then i've had people cancel

222
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,550
on me but i assume it's because

223
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:34,020
i'm too far away or something i've

224
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:34,920
had that too i don't think it's

225
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,540
because you're rating if you have like

226
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:37,710
a two what if it was it

227
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:38,980

00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:40,650
it would be forty three forget it

229
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,120

701
00:24:05,895 --> 00:24:08,026
happen to your character yeah no flashbacks

702
00:24:08,026 --> 00:24:10,605

i haven't experienced that show which is

705
00:24:14,595 --> 00:24:15,495
one of those things where it's not

706
00:24:15,495 --> 00:24:17,535
the show's fault because i expected i

707
00:24:17,535 --> 00:24:18,555
thought it was gonna be something different

708
00:24:18,555 --> 00:24:21,675
than it was which is i liked

709
00:24:21,675 --> 00:24:23,385
the idea of jews

710
00:24:23,415 --> 00:24:25,845
story being told from two absolutely mind

711
00:24:25,845 --> 00:24:27,645
when it first happens in the first

712
00:24:27,645 --> 00:24:29,142

720
00:24:43,395 --> 00:24:43,545

721
00:24:43,545 --> 00:24:45,225
like put murder because people will want

722
00:24:45,885 --> 00:24:46,965
i want to see what's going to

723
00:24:46,965 --> 00:24:49,455
happen yeah but i don't care yeah

724
00:24:49,485 --> 00:24:52,215
you don't like murders only murders in

725
00:24:52,215 --> 00:24:55,785
the building ah well i went away

726
00:24:56,655 --> 00:24:58,635
for that moment oh that's been around

727
00:24:58,665 --> 00:25:00,555
the hey that's not no it's not

728
00:25:00,555 --> 00:25:01,995
the phrase that pays it is very

729
00:25:01,995 --> 00:25:03,345
close to them it's their phrase that

730
00:25:03,345 --> 00:25:03,705
pays

731
00:25:03,735 --> 00:25:05,115

you watch only murders and building yes

733
00:25:07,035 --> 00:25:08,055

734
00:25:08,055 --> 00:25:09,855
episode and they pay a million dollars

735
00:25:09,855 --> 00:25:12,045
yes everyone whoever hears it that's why

736
00:25:12,045 --> 00:25:14,145

street i read that and the other

748
00:25:34,635 --> 00:25:37,335
was a dog on markham street so

749
00:25:37,434 --> 00:25:39,645
the dog was being bullied the dog

750
00:25:39,645 --> 00:25:39,975
was the

751
00:25:41,565 --> 00:25:44,265
dog's perspective the first book is this

752
00:25:44,265 --> 00:25:46,995
kid gets a dog and it's to

753
00:25:47,055 --> 00:25:48,285
this great story but he also has

754
00:25:48,285 --> 00:25:50,055
a bully that's bullying him oh at

755
00:25:50,055 --> 00:25:52,245
school and everything the second book doesn't

756
00:25:52,245 --> 00:25:54,705

00:25:54,705 --> 00:25:57,165
the cops are questioning him knows your

758
00:25:57,165 --> 00:26:01,227
hyung yeah nah huh

759
00:26:01,305 --> 00:26:05,835
nah oh right she released as a

760
00:26:05,835 --> 00:26:06,225
single

761
00:26:07,545 --> 00:26:10,515
imo i think it's it's fifteen seconds

762
00:26:10,815 --> 00:26:12,135
and she was ahead of her time

763
00:26:12,165 --> 00:26:13,785
now feels way longer

764
00:26:15,555 --> 00:26:17,385
that's a long that's pretty short but

765
00:26:17,385 --> 00:26:19,425
it feels longer how long does it

766
00:26:19,425 --> 00:26:20,895
feel to you it feels like it's

767
00:26:20,895 --> 00:26:22,965
four and a half minutes no that's

768
00:26:22,995 --> 00:26:25,125
way too my brain's messed up yeah

769
00:26:25,865 --> 00:26:27,165
yeah yeah somebody took a chunk out

770
00:26:27,165 --> 00:26:29,235
of it oh yeah oh this guy

771
00:26:29,325 --> 00:26:30,645
but here's the take a bite i

772
00:26:30,645 --> 00:26:33,585
read bite i take a binary right

773
00:26:34,185 --> 00:26:34,695
eyebrow

774
00:26:36,135 --> 00:26:37,755
the brain by the dog who commits

775
00:26:37,755 --> 00:26:41,535
crimes um so the first book this

776
00:26:41,535 --> 00:26:42,795
this nice kid he gets the dog

777
00:26:42,795 --> 00:26:44,235

you supposed to read them in this

779
00:26:45,675 --> 00:26:47,925

780
00:26:47,925 --> 00:26:49,785
sense if you do because in the

781
00:26:49,785 --> 00:26:51,915
second book when it's revealed oh my

782
00:26:51,915 --> 00:26:52,875

the way who don't know a standing

957
00:33:41,515 --> 00:33:43,525
ovation is whoa how would you describe

958
00:33:43,525 --> 00:33:45,445
it well it's like you know innovation

959
00:33:46,045 --> 00:33:50,125
yeah yeah i'm sure we're dummied by

960
00:33:50,155 --> 00:33:51,745
usually done around for the listener will

961
00:33:51,745 --> 00:33:52,825
learn a lot i'm trying i'm trying

962
00:33:52,825 --> 00:33:54,625
i'm trying okay at the end of

963
00:33:54,625 --> 00:33:56,515
the show it's typical to give innovation

964
00:33:56,875 --> 00:33:58,585
yeah and everyone does that that's usually

965
00:33:58,645 --> 00:34:01,885
with like palms slapping together yeah sometimes

966
00:34:01,975 --> 00:34:04,405
yeah sometimes the the the where you

967
00:34:04,405 --> 00:34:06,070
put the fingerprints on the finger yeah

968
00:34:06,129 --> 00:34:08,035
i mean lamp invented your own two

969
00:34:08,035 --> 00:34:09,775
hands you don't typically see other people

970
00:34:09,805 --> 00:34:11,395
no no it's always your own hands

971
00:34:11,425 --> 00:34:13,250
yeah slap them together so basically it's

972
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:14,785
the sound of two hands clapping yeah

973
00:34:14,815 --> 00:34:16,945
it's an ovation yeah it's an ovation

974
00:34:16,975 --> 00:34:18,674
sometimes if people really like

975
00:34:18,805 --> 00:34:19,945
put on it

976
00:34:21,175 --> 00:34:23,222
to describe it so you get a

977
00:34:23,245 --> 00:34:24,385
clear picture what it is it's i

978
00:34:24,385 --> 00:34:25,435
mean you wouldn't be doing it if

979
00:34:25,435 --> 00:34:27,325
the show wasn't over and there weren't

980
00:34:27,325 --> 00:34:29,365
people no no no have you ever

981
00:34:29,365 --> 00:34:30,545
been alone in a room and you

982
00:34:30,584 --> 00:34:33,055
start doing because guy shuts you have

983
00:34:33,115 --> 00:34:34,015
i have been alone in a room

984
00:34:34,015 --> 00:34:35,365
and just start clapping because i think

985
00:34:35,575 --> 00:34:36,748
that i had a great but that's

986
00:34:36,748 --> 00:34:38,155
sort of myself but that's not an

987
00:34:38,155 --> 00:34:39,955
ovation because an ovation is always at

988
00:34:39,955 --> 00:34:40,825
the end of something because

989
00:34:40,887 --> 00:34:42,895
they have the same root ove over

990
00:34:42,985 --> 00:34:45,925
ovation ah so that's why it's very

991
00:34:45,925 --> 00:34:47,095
rude and just bad luck in the

992
00:34:47,095 --> 00:34:50,035
theater to clap before oh clap that's

993
00:34:50,035 --> 00:34:52,435
another word for it clap can't do

994
00:34:52,435 --> 00:34:53,845
that before the end of the show

995
00:34:53,875 --> 00:34:55,435
even if you really like although isn't

996
00:34:55,465 --> 00:34:57,685
every second the end of something it's

997
00:34:57,685 --> 00:34:59,395
the end of that second so you

998
00:34:59,395 --> 00:35:00,475
can clap it yeah but it has

999
00:35:00,475 --> 00:35:00,925
to be

1000
00:35:00,985 --> 00:35:04,105
the specific thing is over ok in

1001
00:35:04,135 --> 00:35:05,665
the second if you're standing if you're

1002
00:35:05,665 --> 00:35:07,405
getting a standing ovation can you talk

1003
00:35:07,405 --> 00:35:08,875
about more like what that might look

1004
00:35:08,875 --> 00:35:10,585
this is this is exact for the

1005
00:35:10,585 --> 00:35:12,715
layman for the latest just cover the

1006
00:35:12,715 --> 00:35:14,035
route give us an idea of what

1007
00:35:14,035 --> 00:35:15,595
that might look like if we were

1008
00:35:15,595 --> 00:35:16,615
to be in a room where one

1009
00:35:16,615 --> 00:35:18,505

they're applauding they're giving the ovation yeah

1044

it

1049
00:36:32,725 --> 00:36:34,165
so all it takes is one person

1050
00:36:34,165 --> 00:36:35,965
to stand up than everyone else doesn't

1051
00:36:35,965 --> 00:36:38,065
want that person feel self-conscious so whether

1052
00:36:38,065 --> 00:36:39,535
they liked it or not they have

1053
00:36:39,535 --> 00:36:41,395
to stand absolutely i mean there's plenty

1054
00:36:41,395 --> 00:36:42,685
of times where you're involved in one

1055
00:36:42,685 --> 00:36:44,335

saw on tiktok day-to-day contacts i went

1109
00:38:10,945 --> 00:38:12,655

to get on

1111
00:38:13,285 --> 00:38:15,265
tick tiktok because i feel like i'm

1112
00:38:15,265 --> 00:38:16,585
missing out from like things they were

1113
00:38:16,585 --> 00:38:18,205
learning that were actually interesting like i

1114
00:38:18,235 --> 00:38:19,705
found it interesting exact and i was

1115
00:38:19,705 --> 00:38:21,175
like schwinn tiktok and then i'm like

1116
00:38:21,175 --> 00:38:22,735
last night and people were like looking

1117
00:38:22,735 --> 00:38:23,845
at how much screen time to head

1118
00:38:23,845 --> 00:38:25,225
on tiktok then they all said don't

1119
00:38:25,225 --> 00:38:25,525
do it

1120
00:38:26,785 --> 00:38:29,905
tick tock specifically because it's so authentic

1121
00:38:29,905 --> 00:38:33,205

1122
00:38:33,205 --> 00:38:34,675
i quit twitter and i'm just on

1123
00:38:34,705 --> 00:38:37,255
instagram that the more i scroll the

1124
00:38:37,465 --> 00:38:39,025
the sooner it feels gross to me

1125
00:38:39,205 --> 00:38:41,935
right the soon like it happens so

1126
00:38:41,935 --> 00:38:44,335
much faster than it used to and

1127
00:38:44,365 --> 00:38:45,925
even people like i don't follow a

1128
00:38:45,925 --> 00:38:46,795
ton of people

1129
00:38:46,855 --> 00:38:48,865
so it's mostly people that i know

1130
00:38:48,895 --> 00:38:50,245
right who are i know in real

1131
00:38:50,245 --> 00:38:52,765
life and it's just like what am

1132
00:38:52,765 --> 00:38:54,175

1133
00:38:54,205 --> 00:38:55,885
feeling what am i doing i know

1134
00:38:55,885 --> 00:38:57,085
when i have that feeling so often

1135
00:38:57,135 --> 00:38:58,134
i've talked about it so many times

1136
00:38:58,165 --> 00:38:59,905
everyone's like just fucking stop doing it

1137
00:38:59,905 --> 00:39:01,615
then but i'm like i it's it

1138
00:39:01,615 --> 00:39:03,415
is addictive and great advice i know

1139
00:39:03,415 --> 00:39:05,005
people have done assuming they're saying that

1140
00:39:05,035 --> 00:39:06,865
of course they are um but

1141
00:39:06,985 --> 00:39:09,025

titular game tit and this is submitted

1322
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:51,940
by luke mendez the lighting change in

1323
00:45:51,940 --> 00:45:54,040

1324
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:55,810
three am after dark no no it's

1325
00:45:55,810 --> 00:45:57,430
your brain tumor just up

1326
00:45:59,140 --> 00:46:01,150
um alright we name a movie so

1327
00:46:01,180 --> 00:46:02,830
or someone names a movie than we

1328
00:46:02,830 --> 00:46:05,920
all improvise the scene taking turns doing

1329
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:08,230
lines in character but not not as

1330
00:46:08,230 --> 00:46:09,400
characters from the movie it's just a

1331
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:12,010
random scene okay um it has to

1332
00:46:12,010 --> 00:46:13,240
be totally made up have nothing to

1333
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:14,770
do with the movie all the characters

1334
00:46:14,770 --> 00:46:16,150
are so wet so what is the

1335
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:17,080
none of them so why do you

1336
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:18,310
say a movie well i'll get to

1337
00:46:18,310 --> 00:46:18,670
that

1338
00:46:18,730 --> 00:46:20,890
okay so we're creating new characters who

1339
00:46:20,890 --> 00:46:22,510
are saying lines from move notes

1340
00:46:24,190 --> 00:46:26,410
so creating mean must lead to one

1341
00:46:26,410 --> 00:46:28,270
character saying the name of the movie

1342
00:46:28,270 --> 00:46:30,164
with as much gravitas as you can

1343
00:46:30,164 --> 00:46:33,610
okay okay and you and if we

1344
00:46:33,610 --> 00:46:35,080
all say it at the same time

1345
00:46:35,170 --> 00:46:37,720
bonus amazing okay great so we just

1346
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:39,400
have to eventually end at the title

1347
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:41,350
of the movie yeah we don't have

1348
00:46:41,350 --> 00:46:42,850
to say actual lines from the film

1349
00:46:42,850 --> 00:46:43,450
no it's

1350
00:46:43,660 --> 00:46:45,040
trying to find a way to naturally

1351
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:47,920
say oh yeah they're easy i love

1352
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:49,660
