luck they did that to see i

110
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:43,202
really don't approve of that like when

111
00:03:43,202 --> 00:03:45,000
like a yarn pursuing something or whatever

112
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,170
then they put it in a sock

113
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:48,090
so whatever show recently they did it

114
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:49,860
and it was like i kept reaching

115
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,150
for it i don't think it's fair

116
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:53,370
to not have it yeah that's my

117
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:54,480
because what if my axe

118
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,160

00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:00,330
emergency assistance yeah you can't tell anyone

121
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:02,010
around you i'm not a big fan

122
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:03,630
of phones during the show but i

123
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:05,220
don't want to lock people's phones i

124
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:06,361
just think of course you shouldn't take

125
00:04:06,361 --> 00:04:07,200
it out during the show but what

126
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,940

127
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:09,930

128
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:11,040

130
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,550
and age when it's possible to be

131
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:16,350
here's what we should do instead of

132
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:18,060
giving everyone like one of those yonder

133
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,679
pouches that you put it in it

134
00:04:19,679 --> 00:04:22,140
in you assign someone a phone chaperone

135
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:25,470
a shopper phone and you've talking then

136
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:27,720
like keep making it weirder they they

137
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,030
don't they don't have your phone because

138
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:31,230
you need to be able you need

139
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:32,310
to be able to reach it you

140
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:34,200
have your phone when you pull it

141
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:34,800
out and they slap

142
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,130
up your hand unless you can block

143
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:39,600
their hand and explain why you need

144
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,430
your phone okay i think it should

145
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:44,970
be this there's a designated time every

146
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:46,440
five minutes during the show where everyone

147
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,270
can look at their phone for no

148
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:50,070
matter what the show is everything cases

149
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:51,540
an emergency every yeah

150
00:04:52,612 --> 00:04:55,350
we make it ten no i just

151
00:04:55,350 --> 00:04:57,120
feel it be five five thirty like

152
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,680
for a play you want to keep

153
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,610
them lmao

154
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:03,540
yeah here's how to say emergency could

155
00:05:03,544 --> 00:05:04,800
happen at any time yeah you don't

156
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,020
want wings goodbye yeah yeah well then

157
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:08,430
in that case i have an addendum

158
00:05:08,439 --> 00:05:10,440
to the shopper phone yeah and i

159
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,150
think they should hold the phone they

160
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:13,230
should be standing right next to you

161
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:14,580
with the phone and then if you

162
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:16,470
want the phone you snap your fingers

163
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:17,220
and we have to give you the

164
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:18,720
phone that's more like a phone butler

165
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,010

um roadhouse that movie first of all

201
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:33,600
it's worth watching because it's insane it's

202
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:36,000
it's crazy nut yeah um i'll rest

203
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,050
by the way used to do a

204
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,450
character based on the musician in the

205
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:40,770
roadhouse the healing

206
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:43,230
a blind guitar player yeah what was

207
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:44,850
the character i forget but it was

208
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:46,800
very funny on stage was on stage

209
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:48,240
now okay yeah it was very fun

210
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:49,230
can't imagine whatever

211
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:53,880
um but there is a a moment

212
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:56,160
that establishes this the bad guy in

213
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,130
town played by ben guevara huh and

214
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:01,770
to show that he has ultimate top

215
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:02,520
mattress guy

216
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:06,270
what mattress guy

217
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,240
isn't there a mattress guy who sells

218
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,280
mattresses like ours mattresses nevermind

219
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:16,740
fuck ben ghazi era the mattress salesman

220
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:18,150
this is i don't know if he's

221
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:19,950
related to this mattress salesman but he

222
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:21,990
is an actor ok because everything we

223
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:23,280
talk about has to connect back to

224
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,110
a mattress salesman around i want you

225
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:27,900
to make that rule it's working ever

226
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:30,300
since the tour we did together it's

227
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,470
working for us but i think it's

228
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:32,640
not working for you we do

229
00:07:32,685 --> 00:07:35,430
mattresses we shouldn't have guests couples counseling

230
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:36,570
right now to talk about the i

231
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:38,400
grow weary of it so it's not

232
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,871
working for paul and that means we

233
00:07:39,871 --> 00:07:43,170
should probably pivot okay well that remember

234
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:47,970
france yes um honestly fantastic comedy what

235
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:50,730
was it payback when they're moving the

236
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:52,800
match or the couch up the stairs

237
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,660
and they can't get passed around the

238
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:57,570
corner and some of the that's some

239
00:07:57,570 --> 00:07:59,880
of the best most fun sitcom extremely

to a dodgers game yes i was

623
00:21:02,025 --> 00:21:04,185
a little jealous of pictures

624
00:21:04,335 --> 00:21:05,865
the head with a baseball i didn't

625
00:21:05,865 --> 00:21:08,325
think fully um and holly i took

626
00:21:08,325 --> 00:21:11,175
holly was delightful she liked it she

627
00:21:11,175 --> 00:21:13,635
ate almost a whole daughter dog wow

628
00:21:13,665 --> 00:21:15,555
what did you do with leftover well

629
00:21:15,555 --> 00:21:16,425
i cut it up onto a little

630
00:21:16,425 --> 00:21:18,795
plate and i left it on the

631
00:21:18,795 --> 00:21:20,175
plate and then eventually threw it out

632
00:21:20,625 --> 00:21:23,055
um yeah we're using it's still there

633
00:21:23,055 --> 00:21:24,255
or you want it

634
00:21:24,615 --> 00:21:25,005
yeah

635
00:21:26,265 --> 00:21:27,390
i think it's probably the traffic but

636
00:21:27,508 --> 00:21:28,575
find it ok

637
00:21:29,985 --> 00:21:32,115
this trash can at dodger stadium my

638
00:21:32,115 --> 00:21:33,465
dodger dog would be in there i

639
00:21:33,465 --> 00:21:34,515
don't know if i told you this

640
00:21:34,515 --> 00:21:35,475
that one time i went to a

641
00:21:35,475 --> 00:21:37,485
dodger game with river butcher and a

642
00:21:37,695 --> 00:21:40,455
woman a couple rows ahead of us

643
00:21:40,455 --> 00:21:42,435
like caddy corner chen i'd say dodgers

644
00:21:42,435 --> 00:21:44,625
with an s i said a dodger

645
00:21:44,625 --> 00:21:46,695
scheme it does use a dodger game

646
00:21:46,725 --> 00:21:48,315
i don't think anyone cares yeah i

647
00:21:48,315 --> 00:21:49,395
don't want to be seen as theirs

648
00:21:49,455 --> 00:21:50,145
i don't think there's this

649
00:21:50,145 --> 00:21:52,455
style guide for that yeah i guess

650
00:21:52,455 --> 00:21:54,435
i yeah i say dodger game yeah

651
00:21:54,525 --> 00:21:57,285
okay yeah because i think there there's

652
00:21:57,315 --> 00:21:59,325
one of one of them is a

653
00:21:59,325 --> 00:22:03,585
dodger yes los angeles dodger but if

654
00:22:03,585 --> 00:22:05,235
you ever have two in the same

655
00:22:05,235 --> 00:22:06,885
room which hardly ever happens by the

656
00:22:06,885 --> 00:22:08,865
way yeah they're ever in rooms no

657
00:22:08,985 --> 00:22:10,185
roosevelt so they're always outside

658
00:22:10,335 --> 00:22:12,975
a person yelled at you um no

659
00:22:14,715 --> 00:22:17,085
just assuming ah because that's what i

660
00:22:17,085 --> 00:22:18,315
wanna do someone told me to keep

661
00:22:18,315 --> 00:22:19,515
it down that's all

662
00:22:22,905 --> 00:22:23,835
they were listening to the game on

663
00:22:23,835 --> 00:22:26,235
the radio oh yeah you know i

664
00:22:26,235 --> 00:22:27,945
like that i like that too yeah

665
00:22:27,975 --> 00:22:29,715
it's so silly she's oh weird about

666
00:22:29,715 --> 00:22:31,965
that because you you can't sometimes you

667
00:22:31,965 --> 00:22:33,225
don't know you want to hear the

668
00:22:33,225 --> 00:22:34,245
play-by-play yeah

669
00:22:35,295 --> 00:22:36,555
and you just want to know what's

670
00:22:36,555 --> 00:22:38,805
happening and so i really i it's

671
00:22:38,805 --> 00:22:40,785
so old-fashioned bad and people keeping the

672
00:22:40,785 --> 00:22:42,135
school during the score i see so

673
00:22:42,135 --> 00:22:43,395
many people do there yeah do you

674
00:22:43,395 --> 00:22:45,705
think those people who keep the score

675
00:22:46,815 --> 00:22:48,975
like they do it for every game

676
00:22:49,035 --> 00:22:50,085
or they just like this is a

677
00:22:50,085 --> 00:22:51,165
fun thing to do to do it

678
00:22:51,165 --> 00:22:53,625

824
00:27:34,245 --> 00:27:38,892
works something j age but that's just

825
00:27:38,895 --> 00:27:41,565

we have three ch are really know

1146
00:38:47,235 --> 00:38:48,705
what it is is we played this

1147
00:38:48,705 --> 00:38:50,865
game recently but we learned from a

1148
00:38:50,895 --> 00:38:52,905
comment that we were doing it wrong

1149
00:38:52,905 --> 00:38:55,695
and it's actually really very bad economy

1150
00:38:55,725 --> 00:38:56,985
was good for once yeah

1151
00:38:57,047 --> 00:38:59,325
and we learned something the game i

1152
00:38:59,325 --> 00:39:01,065
don't know if it was called umbrella

1153
00:39:01,095 --> 00:39:02,355
or if it's picnic or what it

1154
00:39:02,355 --> 00:39:04,215
is but it's the game where basically

1155
00:39:04,245 --> 00:39:05,145
we can we can say we're going

1156
00:39:05,145 --> 00:39:06,315
to a picnic because i think that's

1157
00:39:06,405 --> 00:39:08,415
a common one we let we hope

1158
00:39:08,415 --> 00:39:11,865
into pure nickname she's everywhere so besides

1159
00:39:11,865 --> 00:39:13,845
what the rule is for the picnic

1160
00:39:13,875 --> 00:39:15,135

1166
00:39:22,185 --> 00:39:26,235

1168
00:39:29,925 --> 00:39:31,155
works is the one who did the

1169
00:39:31,155 --> 00:39:34,845
reservoir alters it no beverages one person

1170
00:39:35,115 --> 00:39:36,855
comes with the rule for what's allowed

1171
00:39:36,855 --> 00:39:37,305
the picnic

1172
00:39:37,305 --> 00:39:38,535
