1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:00,570
three

2
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:10,560
ah

3
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:24,004
ah oh yeah whoo oh yeah who

4
00:00:24,004 --> 00:00:25,290
was the first person to do a

5
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:27,510
vocal run like that until people lose

6
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:29,730
their mind okay the song's over you

7
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:30,660
shouldn't be doing that

8
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,070
because singing used to be like this

9
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:35,070
ah i've got a flaw before oh

10
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:37,560
well to take my name and going

11
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,240
even further back do you think caveman

12
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,970
sang yeah yeah you think for sure

13
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:46,590
they did three hours yeah wow the

14
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:48,060
why don't even think why do we

15
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:49,980
think they rented why did we make

16
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:50,880
why why why do

17
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:52,320
we put that gravelly grown on there

18
00:00:52,347 --> 00:00:53,400
we know as they sounded like

19
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:57,870
three was another video of the what

20
00:00:57,870 --> 00:00:59,700
king tut sounded like

21
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:02,490
was there a jesus one to that

22
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,550
video so funny as i love to

23
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:07,260
every airways thing though

24
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:10,170
hi i'm kim

25
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:13,072
it was so funny but if you

26
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,280
need a video where they they have

27
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,350
the caveman skull and they tried to

28
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:17,940
determine what the voice was sound like

29
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:19,890
and so they have this like vocal

30
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,770
expertise dude or whatever they're saying okay

31
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:24,462
now it pitched higher than like i

32
00:01:24,462 --> 00:01:27,840
feel i'm pronunciation british too

33
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:29,430
it's

34
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:32,640
are you playing your game

35
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:36,450
oh

36
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:41,010
so yeah he asks them to to

37
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:43,080
pitch their their the person the anthropologist

38
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,310
is looking to the skull and saying

39
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,740
it's like somebody who's like a linguist

40
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:48,807
and knows some souls and how yes

41
00:01:48,807 --> 00:01:51,360
like here's how would you know reverberate

42
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:53,070
throughout the scholar whatever and so this

43
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:55,800
guy that's good at um you know

44
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:59,040
duplicating sounds ah i guess

45
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,629
she's just like an actor you know

46
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:02,100
is able but he's like very provisioned

47
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,830
with his voice is is following the

48
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:07,740
the instructions and he's just saying one

49
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:09,720
two three and then adding in the

50
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,690
adjustments as they're giving it to and

51
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:13,860
eventually john like come

52
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:18,240
and that's what jason that's all caveman

53
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:18,840
sounded yeah

54
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:25,410
hey everyone i drew on the one

55
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:29,550
two three so there should be some

67
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:54,060
to freedom my name is scott my

68
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:56,070
name is lauren my name is paul

69
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:58,620
that's right that's what your names are

70
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:00,120
yeah i was wondering it's been so

71
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,790
long what is the longest you've gone

72
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:04,020
not knowing somebody's name

73
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:06,420
you would see rose so many decades

74
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:08,760
yeah very long i there's one person

75
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,680
in particular that i think of that

76
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,380
i started seeing when i first got

77
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:15,603
into comedy and i know he must

78
00:03:15,603 --> 00:03:17,190
to come up to me and introduced

79
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:18,660
himself at one point and then it's

80
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:21,060
just like it would be very rude

81
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:22,620
to ask anyone what is asked for

82
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,210
decades now yeah it's so

83
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,530
weird when it goes that long and

84
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:27,240
you don't even overhear it from somebody

85
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:30,540

86
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:31,890

friends ah nice baby so oh so

139

the thing about there are there are

140
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:39,060
certain situations where maybe you see the

141
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:42,360
same group of people every month or

142
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,150
something sure situations like that it's like

143
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:45,360
tj

144
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,370
just long enough where it's like i've

145
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:49,320
forgotten everybody's name that i met right

146
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:50,640
and spend a day with them had

147
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,980
a great time miss maybe i never

148
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:54,150
expected to see them again and my

149
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:55,980
my brain just deleted those files here

150
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:56,820
you don't need that kind of thing

151
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:59,220
i took a pottery class recently right

152
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:02,130
tell us everything congratulations thanks i'm really

153
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:04,380
cultured you make anything i did but

154
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:05,310
here's what i did

155
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:07,860
is i was saying everybody's name all

156
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:10,680
day long on the set oh okay

157
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:13,320
tom cruise every exactly my old scene

158
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,850
but it does work when you say

159
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:16,710
actually what they tell you is when

160
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:17,730
you meet someone you should say their

161
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:19,440
name back to them because that actually

162
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,480
was a lie yeah mention your brain

163
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:22,920
yes if he don't say it out

164
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,570
loud you're really not giving yourself much

165
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:25,680
but i think everyone you

166
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:26,910
talked to you have to assume you're

167
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:27,930
never going to talk to them ever

168
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:30,600
again see i think only i think

169
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,790
on a set everyone should have name

170
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:33,780
tags and i don't mean that in

171
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:35,460
it i think so choose helpful we

172
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:36,540
should've done a bazillion and it was

173
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:38,310
great yeah it was great because you

174
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:39,840
really just know everyone's yeah and after

175
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:40,710

00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:16,320
you're seeing these people every week i

249
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,290
did learn everyone's name within that time

250
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:21,570
period i only know two out of

251
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:23,070
three now you know it's like that

252
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:23,430

the class yeah you learned their names

255
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:29,010
because is there a lot of interaction

256
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,140
not really but it's a lot of

257
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:33,630
people autonomy i each other and being

258
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:35,520
like hi we know some small talk

259
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,080
of i learned a bit about their

260
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,970
history some people talk more that you

261
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:40,560
need in a class environment like that

262
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:42,030
there are some people who are going

263
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:43,980

things that turned out okay but i

270
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:58,710

you don't care enough to to make

272
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:02,220
them and i never want my free

00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:03,240
time because you're allowed to go to

274
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,550
the studio and like practice and it

275
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:06,480

277
00:10:07,835 --> 00:10:09,035

296
00:10:45,215 --> 00:10:46,745

get some play clay on the wheel

299
00:10:51,095 --> 00:10:52,925
leak you get the clay you you

300
00:10:52,925 --> 00:10:55,925
weigh it you weigh it you need

301
00:10:55,925 --> 00:10:57,185
it out which is how the word

302
00:10:57,185 --> 00:10:58,025
i can't think of right now

303
00:10:58,025 --> 00:10:59,525
now and then to get all the

304
00:10:59,525 --> 00:11:01,475
air bubbles out seems like too much

305
00:11:01,495 --> 00:11:02,765
noise and you make you make these

306
00:11:02,765 --> 00:11:04,595
like balls that are like about the

307
00:11:04,595 --> 00:11:05,675
size that you want and had the

308
00:11:05,705 --> 00:11:06,935
right weight and then learn by the

309
00:11:06,935 --> 00:11:10,175
way is is mining cupping cupping like

310
00:11:10,175 --> 00:11:11,135
hagrid balls

311
00:11:12,365 --> 00:11:14,135

a potter like harry potter yes oh

314
00:11:18,935 --> 00:11:20,405
and the the time

315
00:11:21,545 --> 00:11:24,455
and then you wedging that's when you

316
00:11:24,455 --> 00:11:25,385
get all the air out of it

317
00:11:25,415 --> 00:11:27,725
due to it kinda like that and

318
00:11:27,725 --> 00:11:30,095
then you like oil i'd need do

319
00:11:30,095 --> 00:11:31,745

320
00:11:31,745 --> 00:11:33,065

330
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:49,295

00:11:55,235 --> 00:11:57,125
better like it's like oh here just

336
00:11:57,185 --> 00:11:58,775

a bowl master two bowls lucas over

342
00:12:10,235 --> 00:12:11,314
here then i have to make the

343
00:12:11,314 --> 00:12:12,515
myself you know it's kind of different

344
00:12:12,515 --> 00:12:14,855
story but i did have fun there's

345
00:12:14,855 --> 00:12:16,625
how many bowls you make framing and

346
00:12:16,625 --> 00:12:17,945
things that i don't like yeah many

347
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:19,055
bowls did you make after the two

348
00:12:19,055 --> 00:12:20,885
bowls that you made with assistance in

349
00:12:20,885 --> 00:12:21,785
class i think i n

350
00:12:21,785 --> 00:12:22,835
ended up i threw a couple in

351
00:12:22,835 --> 00:12:24,995
the trash that were honestly no less

352
00:12:24,995 --> 00:12:27,725
wasteful i was like i'm the kind

353
00:12:27,725 --> 00:12:28,685
of person who will keep this for

354
00:12:28,685 --> 00:12:30,815
the rest of my life right so

355
00:12:30,815 --> 00:12:31,745
i better throw it in the trash

356
00:12:31,775 --> 00:12:34,025
now i do not want this and

357
00:12:34,025 --> 00:12:35,135
there are enough that i made that

358
00:12:35,135 --> 00:12:37,595
are like usable to put some nuts

359
00:12:37,595 --> 00:12:40,295
in or some balls and just super

360
00:12:41,885 --> 00:12:45,335
some gonads so specialty even just drop

361
00:12:45,335 --> 00:12:46,805
by your place and put their testicles

362
00:12:46,805 --> 00:12:49,235
particularly easy i didn't think straight yes

363
00:12:49,462 --> 00:12:50,795
so the first night met an astra

364
00:12:50,795 --> 00:12:51,965
that was really good for his friend

365
00:12:52,325 --> 00:12:54,155
and airstream the first week you make

366
00:12:54,155 --> 00:12:55,865
a bowl and they they sort of

367
00:12:55,865 --> 00:12:56,915
cut corners so you can get the

368
00:12:56,915 --> 00:12:59,345
feel for it that's that's a separate

369
00:12:59,345 --> 00:13:01,415
class that's like your one off class

370
00:13:01,415 --> 00:13:01,565
thing

371
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:02,735
so it's a one off and then

372
00:13:02,735 --> 00:13:03,785
you can sign up for them though

373
00:13:03,785 --> 00:13:05,255
i would say very many here starting

374
00:13:05,255 --> 00:13:06,455
from scratches if you never took that

375
00:13:06,455 --> 00:13:07,865
class because they don't care if you

376
00:13:07,865 --> 00:13:09,875
took that right they even save it

377
00:13:10,025 --> 00:13:11,645
they don't hear you i'm so if

378
00:13:11,645 --> 00:13:13,145
i understand you said that the the

379
00:13:13,145 --> 00:13:16,115
first class that you do end up

380
00:13:16,115 --> 00:13:18,027
making a bowl and with their assistant

381
00:13:18,027 --> 00:13:19,355
and they glaze it for you but

382
00:13:19,535 --> 00:13:21,185
skip they skip a bunch of yeah

383
00:13:21,245 --> 00:13:21,785
steps

384
00:13:21,875 --> 00:13:24,335
and then like glazing and then sure

385
00:13:24,365 --> 00:13:26,135
sure we all like glazing yeah who

386
00:13:26,135 --> 00:13:29,135
doesn't and then the next lesson they're

387
00:13:29,135 --> 00:13:30,665
like oh you think you made a

388
00:13:30,665 --> 00:13:32,705
fucking bowl guess what it's a piece

389
00:13:32,705 --> 00:13:33,695
of shit you didn't know how to

390
00:13:33,695 --> 00:13:35,315
wedge you don't know what you're doing

391
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:36,755
you don't know what anything is they

392
00:13:36,755 --> 00:13:38,135
break away break you down you suffer

393
00:13:38,135 --> 00:13:40,235
and you can just take the one-offs

394
00:13:40,295 --> 00:13:41,825
classes because you leave there

395
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:43,415
when you actually know how to make

396
00:13:43,415 --> 00:13:45,485
anything who cares but what i will

397
00:13:45,485 --> 00:13:47,555
say is that by taking the class

398
00:13:47,585 --> 00:13:49,535
one thing i learned is i like

399
00:13:49,685 --> 00:13:51,575
so i like doing the activity but

400
00:13:51,575 --> 00:13:55,715
i don't like listening yeah oh case

401
00:13:55,715 --> 00:13:56,884
you guys haven't picked up the freedom

402
00:13:56,884 --> 00:13:57,305
story

403
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:00,575
i really felt like i was at

404
00:14:00,575 --> 00:14:01,985
school sometimes i was like that's the

405
00:14:01,985 --> 00:14:03,485
worst part of school is feeling like

406
00:14:03,485 --> 00:14:04,505
you're at school you know you're going

407
00:14:04,505 --> 00:14:06,035
like i could be doing anything else

408
00:14:06,065 --> 00:14:08,495
i chose this yeah and i'm wondering

409
00:14:08,495 --> 00:14:10,744
why and i've looked to i've looked

410
00:14:10,744 --> 00:14:13,835
into college classes just for like certain

411
00:14:13,835 --> 00:14:15,875
subjects that i that i i do

412
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:17,165
and they always something to leave you

413
00:14:18,455 --> 00:14:20,555
i open physically right now

414
00:14:21,605 --> 00:14:22,775
they're like get out here's the ladies

415
00:14:22,775 --> 00:14:25,445
locker room yeah i just do lago

416
00:14:25,445 --> 00:14:27,845
we talk what does this gym class

417
00:14:28,055 --> 00:14:29,825
nor i've looked into community college i

418
00:14:29,825 --> 00:14:31,145
get to see like killing plug it

419
00:14:31,145 --> 00:14:33,275
up plug it up could i could

420
00:14:33,275 --> 00:14:34,925
i learn more about history or whatever

421
00:14:34,925 --> 00:14:36,755
but then that's the fear is that

422
00:14:36,755 --> 00:14:37,955
i'll just feel like i'm back at

423
00:14:37,955 --> 00:14:39,395
school again where it's like i'm not

424
00:14:39,395 --> 00:14:40,955
interested in this there's i think there's

425
00:14:40,985 --> 00:14:42,815
two things at play here one is

426
00:14:42,905 --> 00:14:45,575
it's i think it's it's very rare

427
00:14:45,605 --> 00:14:48,485
to be a captivating teacher of adults

428
00:14:48,665 --> 00:14:51,245
right number two i think it's very

429
00:14:51,245 --> 00:14:53,375
hard for adults who don't have to

430
00:14:53,375 --> 00:14:56,195
be in school anymore to to like

431
00:14:56,195 --> 00:14:57,755
sit still for this shit where it's

432
00:14:57,755 --> 00:14:59,735
like i don't yeah this is more

433
00:14:59,735 --> 00:15:00,935
steps than i thought i liked when

434
00:15:00,935 --> 00:15:01,145
they were

435
00:15:01,145 --> 00:15:02,855
would set me free to do my

436
00:15:02,855 --> 00:15:04,745
thing and then give notes and help

437
00:15:04,775 --> 00:15:06,035
yeah what like that was all really

438
00:15:06,035 --> 00:15:07,655
good so then i've said like okay

439
00:15:07,655 --> 00:15:09,725
well i like reading books maybe i

440
00:15:09,725 --> 00:15:11,225
could buy a book on the subject

441
00:15:11,225 --> 00:15:12,425
and i'll learn more about it and

442
00:15:12,425 --> 00:15:13,595
then i can't find the right book

443
00:15:14,015 --> 00:15:15,365
okay you're also never going to read

444
00:15:15,365 --> 00:15:17,495
the book i know um but but

445
00:15:17,525 --> 00:15:18,845
they don't just die without knowing the

446
00:15:18,853 --> 00:15:20,195
stuff there are some people who love

447
00:15:20,195 --> 00:15:21,305
being students yeah

448
00:15:21,305 --> 00:15:25,415
i love make isms autodidact no realize

449
00:15:25,415 --> 00:15:28,115
love to less abraham lincoln impersonator yes

450
00:15:28,115 --> 00:15:29,105
and he's really good at with the

451
00:15:29,127 --> 00:15:31,985
big big head and you excuse me

452
00:15:31,985 --> 00:15:32,693
for just one moment

453
00:15:33,785 --> 00:15:34,955
where did that come from i don't

454
00:15:34,955 --> 00:15:35,255
know

455
00:15:36,515 --> 00:15:38,525
it has no connection first thought best

456
00:15:38,525 --> 00:15:41,135
thought i was really racking my brain

457
00:15:42,185 --> 00:15:44,045
just sounds like he loves to learn

458
00:15:44,045 --> 00:15:46,295
and he's always learning something and it's

459
00:15:46,295 --> 00:15:48,755
very cool and huge but even his

460
00:15:48,755 --> 00:15:50,645
admirable it's great he was a little

461
00:15:50,645 --> 00:15:53,465
bit like ones pottery and but he

462
00:15:53,465 --> 00:15:55,115
was getting good at the autodidact himself

463
00:15:55,235 --> 00:15:57,202
because somebody else was dating yeah yeah

464
00:15:57,305 --> 00:15:58,749
yeah he did have a lot of

465
00:15:58,749 --> 00:15:59,525
fun when he got to go by

466
00:15:59,525 --> 00:16:01,565
himself and just do it but it

467
00:16:01,565 --> 00:16:02,345
was you think that he's

468
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:05,345
good enough at things where like he

469
00:16:05,345 --> 00:16:06,935
could just go into like a pottery

470
00:16:06,935 --> 00:16:09,035
class without any teacher and by the

471
00:16:09,035 --> 00:16:09,875
end of it he would have a

472
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:10,925
bowl and be like i don't know

473
00:16:10,925 --> 00:16:12,065
how this happened but i made a

474
00:16:12,065 --> 00:16:15,155
bowl um no it's potteries i want

475
00:16:15,365 --> 00:16:15,845
tuesday

476
00:16:16,985 --> 00:16:19,265
or is release specific it's amazing when

477
00:16:19,265 --> 00:16:20,825
you watch the teacher because they'll just

478
00:16:20,825 --> 00:16:22,475
like create something out of nothing it's

479
00:16:22,475 --> 00:16:23,885
like amazing to watch people who are

480
00:16:23,885 --> 00:16:25,955
really good at that but when you're

481
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:27,215
trying to make something you can fuck

482
00:16:27,215 --> 00:16:28,535
it up so easily it's like you

483
00:16:28,535 --> 00:16:30,425
really need someone to explain the basics

484
00:16:30,425 --> 00:16:32,525
before you can i mean i think

485
00:16:32,525 --> 00:16:33,485
before you can start i also took

486
00:16:33,485 --> 00:16:34,865
puttering in high school we had it

487
00:16:34,865 --> 00:16:36,785

realize it was oh it was the

997

premise of a sketch yeah exactly exactly

998
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:00,690
so you guys did improv based on

999
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:02,310

1000
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:03,750

a was too good to be true

but i like this

1025
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:52,380

1027
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:56,400

1032
00:35:04,290 --> 00:35:06,720
stakes so i forgot about that you

1033
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,340
just said yeah and i don't remember

1034
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:09,510
that one with me pose i remember

1035
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:10,110
the high

1036
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,330
i watched it again and i didn't

1037
00:35:12,330 --> 00:35:14,130
remember it and here's what brand new

1038
00:35:14,130 --> 00:35:15,661
to me go really fast the episodes

1039
00:35:15,661 --> 00:35:17,430
are fifteen minutes you're like you're not

1040
00:35:17,430 --> 00:35:18,780
going to or you just kind of

1041
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:20,070
have like one part that sticks out

1042
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:21,420
here's what i find interesting though is

1043
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:22,470
is like i think it would be

1044
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:25,470
interesting to watch a sketch show where

1045
00:35:25,530 --> 00:35:27,810
a premise is given to two different

1046
00:35:27,810 --> 00:35:30,240
teams yeah and you see like that

1047
00:35:30,270 --> 00:35:30,600
you see

1048
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:32,610
how's a both write the sketch yeah

1049
00:35:32,610 --> 00:35:33,987
and it would be wildly different and

1050
00:35:33,990 --> 00:35:36,120
it would be they'd be two totally

1051
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:38,010
different sketches yeah with the same premise

1052
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:38,910
i think it would be really interest

1053
00:35:38,910 --> 00:35:40,530
which is kind of what happened here

1054
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,540
because the guest was dhruv uday singh

1055
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:44,340
and then he had to he didn't

1056
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:45,360
catch it either and then he had

1057
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,530
to come up with a reason why

1058
00:35:46,530 --> 00:35:48,480
this guy had these things it was

1059
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,860
trying to sell them in the wording

1060
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:50,790
of it and everything

1061
00:35:50,850 --> 00:35:52,440
yeah and it'll be a fun live

1062
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,390
show yeah well it would be a

1063
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:57,462
fun live show nobody steal this way

1064
00:35:57,462 --> 00:35:58,620
where you get the premise alive and

1065
00:35:58,620 --> 00:35:59,790
you have to write the sketch in

1066
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:01,410
front of everyone like yeah like i

1067
00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:03,180
feel like no no no no including

1068
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:05,490
lunch order like there's other things that

1069
00:36:05,490 --> 00:36:06,720
happen during the show but like people

1070
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,490
get sent off to do that task

1071
00:36:08,490 --> 00:36:09,480
and when they come back and perform

1072
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,740
it yeah yeah

1073
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:12,270

have to go save the dog again

1122
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:46,230

00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,810
space laser at it and it stopped

1187
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:05,520
who i didn't hear that part yeah

1188
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:07,770
what we what we put in the

1189
00:40:07,770 --> 00:40:09,030
space laser at the moon and then

1190
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:10,230
they made the earth know from the

1191
00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:11,550
moon that's where we kept the space

1192
00:40:11,550 --> 00:40:14,160
laser oh and then this guys can

1193
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,230

1218
00:41:09,915 --> 00:41:11,625

00:55:35,215 --> 00:55:36,835
done yeah that's right there are there's

1603
00:55:36,835 --> 00:55:38,665
a parallel universe out there where everything
