i know i'm and and this is

97
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,680
my response i feel that there's going

98
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,610
to be a lot of people doing

99
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:30,510
that at parks we're not going to

100
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:31,710
have our own space you know and

101
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:32,910
what i like is the freedom we

102
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:34,050
have around you to be our true

103
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:35,820
selves oh and i feel like maybe

104
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:36,840
you should write like an air bnb

105
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:41,160

107
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:45,090
and my kick flips yeah that we

108
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:46,320
could put hot dogs at the top

109
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,640
of the river rolled down to the

110
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,320
bud okay that's all i thought the

111
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:50,940
hotdogs were like a lure to get

112
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:52,470
us to actually do the trick so

113
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:54,030
we could grab the hot dogs on

114
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:54,960
our way down so you're on the

115
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,240
other just for tricks okay so we're

116
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,530

we were like in the second row

248
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:20,670
so we're very close to the orchestra

249
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:21,540
it was really fun to get to

250
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:23,130
watch them up close and look kind

251
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:24,720
of trading just like him you can't

252
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,680
hear the orcas

253
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,560
ultra well enough sometimes you know i've

00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,330
never been there oh okay great but

255
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:30,900
it was great

256
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:33,930
this was a walter disney concert hall

257
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,760
yeah dude all that oh yeah the

258
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,257
acoustics are really good yeah i guess

259
00:08:37,484 --> 00:08:39,240
go to the ball and they have

260
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,220
like oh well yeah like the orchestra

261
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:43,650
playing with a yellow yolo so yeah

262
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:45,690
the orchestra's just basically like a really

263
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,190
low keyboard and i'm like no i

264
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:48,480
want that thing pump i feel like

265
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,510
the orchestra in those instances is protesting

266
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:51,960
because

267
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,789
like this we don't write music using

268
00:08:53,789 --> 00:08:55,560
zak yeah i think so they're they're

269
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:57,750
making a big show of their point

270
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:59,851
aiming their instruments yeah they're mining and

271
00:08:59,851 --> 00:09:01,710
then they're pointing at the electric guitars

272
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:03,330
and zoom size down that's right yeah

273
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:04,680
yeah i think the only other one

274
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,060
of those i've seen is for that

275
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:09,330
documentary jane about er um jane goodall

276
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:12,060
um hello they have they had an

277
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:12,240
orc

278
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:14,490
no one it was like an event

279
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:16,559
for it but orchestra of gorillas it

280
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:18,660
was like impressive it was like the

281
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:20,850
premiere of that documentary something and she

282
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:21,809
was there and then they had an

283
00:09:21,809 --> 00:09:24,619
orchestra blah but it was because it's

284
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,810
just random music right less impactful to

285
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:29,790
me than to have so they did

286
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:31,500
the entire score they just played a

287
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:32,400
few songs into the

288
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,500
whole thing you won't be fun is

289
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,900
to see like an episode of ah

290
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:39,990
reality tv with a full orchestra yeah

291
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:40,710

292
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:42,690
poo poo poo doo doo doo and

293
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:45,600
doing that on this without really percussion

294
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,130
instruments when that would be as a

295
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:47,550
question

296
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,200

direct

316
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:31,650
actor himself by the way this way

317
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:33,540
this was an adverse like you know

318
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:35,340
this was an answer on the people

319
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:37,500
magazine oh really they were like what

320
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:40,440
portly director we were like shots fired

321
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,520
people if you don't know what i'm

322
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:44,940
talking about my instagram last week i

323
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:46,980
was staying in a big hubbub at

324
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,200
an air bnb limping out at an

325
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,010
air bnb and they

326
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:52,320
had a people magazine board game we

327
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,750
opened and it had been unopened and

328
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:56,250
it came out in nineteen eighty four

329
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:58,770
and it was trivial pursuit of all

330
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,680
like entertainment questions that were very important

331
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,150
to people at nineteen eighty four that

332
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:04,680
we had no idea what the answers

333
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:05,730
were it's so funny it's such a

334
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:07,500
dumb idea to make such a specific

335
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,270
game like it's right i think they

336
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:10,140
fire you don't

337
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:12,484
trivial pursuit was like so big we

338
00:11:12,484 --> 00:11:13,890
yeah get in on this and it's

339
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:15,810

371
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:32,010
great i always think that's ah that's

372
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:33,750
a really cool thing when a day

373
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:36,150
vector can make it so that you

374
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:37,440
see a thing in your mind that

375
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,210
was not yeah oh no show in

376
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:41,190
scream five i did like when the

377
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:43,170
knife went right into the person's face

378
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:45,990
oh yeah that wasn't saying but wait

379
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:47,640
i also have to say i never

380
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,290
understood that norman bates was like a

381
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:50,730
cutie pie nice guy

382
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:53,490
oh is that what they're sort of

383
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:54,750
making him out to be well i

384
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:55,920
think the whole way through he's just

385
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,330
like he then gets weirder as it

386
00:12:57,330 --> 00:12:59,190
goes on but i didn't know i

387
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:01,230
i've never known anything about this movie

388
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,550
so i thought when i hear that

389
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:04,890
name i think it's like creepy you

390
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:06,300
know yeah yeah yeah because in the

391
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:08,640
shot for shot remake that gus van

392
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,500
zandt did with vince vaughn as norman

393
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,280

395
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:17,100
did i know that but they the

396
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:19,500
the additions are very weird because like

397
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:21,840
the the one of the only additions

398
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,890
that they do at shot for shot

399
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:24,420
but one of the only additive things

400
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:26,340
they do is norman bates in the

401
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:27,870

403
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:31,830
like spy on somebody and drinking

00:24:19,205 --> 00:24:20,615
to her and as i reach out

711
00:24:20,645 --> 00:24:23,615

the way around and i just have

1027
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,860

1029
00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:56,080

1030
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:58,197
really bad drink for everyone because i

1031
00:34:58,270 --> 00:35:00,250

00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:08,440
that something has zero of any of

1036
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,850
the things yeah this is cancer

1037
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,260
water that's kind of what i'm saying

1038
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:13,660
yeah yeah yeah yeah who knows here's

1039
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:17,110
because flavored sparkling water is now the

1040
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:19,630
default yeah everywhere you go yeah i

1041
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:21,550
was at a friend's birthday party on

1042
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:25,510
saturday and he offered me a drink

1043
00:35:25,570 --> 00:35:27,760
and it was daytime so i didn't

1044
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,440
want to like wine or anything

1045
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,150
and i said do you have like

1046
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:32,710
a soda and he goes what do

1047
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:34,660
you like do like like cola or

1048
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:35,800
like yeah that would be fine would

1049
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,380
you like a cola what you've this

1050
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:39,760
is not a conversation that a human

1051
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,200
being has had with another human being

1052
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,300
it sounds like you're two weeks late

1053
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:44,680
can i believe you said do like

1054
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:46,780
doing a cola what kind of soda

1055
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:48,790
did you yeah well here hola here's

1056
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:51,820

he's from mars he comes

1058
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:57,280
twenty fifteen he comes back and he

1059
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:00,880
has three sparkling waters because i realize

1060
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:03,190
oh he thinks that's cola well he

1061
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:05,410
hasn't he doesn't know what he doesn't

1062

have soda in the house right i

1063
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:09,040
see so he's like any while he

1064
00:36:09,043 --> 00:36:12,100

1065
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:14,350
just pulled a cola flavored water knows

1066
00:36:14,410 --> 00:36:15,760

1166
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:18,460

first thing i was giving birth i

1168
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:22,180
like i think partly it was like

1169
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:23,170
the first thing i watched her to

1170
00:39:23,170 --> 00:39:24,820
give me ten minutes after well like

1171
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:27,190
once i was bringing in the room

1172
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:28,810
i put it on and i was

1173
00:39:28,810 --> 00:39:30,370
like cracking i think it was like

1174
00:39:30,370 --> 00:39:32,140
so high from every but it's also

1175
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:33,610
very funny and then when rewatching it

1176
00:39:33,610 --> 00:39:35,230
now when it's so funny

1177
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:37,360

1178
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,650
many funny things from it but yeah

1179
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:40,660

so okay look sparkling soft drinks okay

1184
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:52,900
look contained between eighty five percent and

1185
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:55,090
ninety nine percent water which means they

1186
00:39:55,090 --> 00:39:56,950
can help quench thirst and count towards

1187
00:39:56,950 --> 00:39:59,680
your recommended daily fluid intake so it's

1188
00:39:59,710 --> 00:40:01,750
one percent brown

1189
00:40:03,250 --> 00:40:05,320

she's lump it's in she's in my

1206
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:06,780
head i mean eighty meaning namely it's

1207
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:08,160
about someone who sits alone in a

1208
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:11,250
boggy marsh totally emotionless except for her

1209
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:12,600
heart i know because i'm like what

1210
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:13,080
is that

1211
00:41:13,530 --> 00:41:15,750
mud float up into her pajamas and

1212
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:18,030
she totally confused all the passing proud

1213
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:19,140
to say as a child i love

1214
00:41:19,148 --> 00:41:20,580
this song and that makes sense because

1215
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:22,530
it's definitely a goof troop nothing makes

1216
00:41:22,530 --> 00:41:24,178
sense sign for children like that's just

1217
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:25,410
what that is huh

1218
00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:27,840
but it rocks is it from rocks

1219
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:29,550
my cock song would you say it's

1220
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:31,620
true how many cocks do you have

1221
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:32,580
well not anymore

1222
00:41:33,150 --> 00:41:34,410
okay would you say you saved twenty

1223
00:41:34,410 --> 00:41:36,664
six yeah goof troop corps is group

1224
00:41:36,664 --> 00:41:38,474
trooper is your garage if your patrol

1225
00:41:38,474 --> 00:41:39,870
little of the burgers it puts the

1226
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:42,270
lotion in the basket and it gets

1227
00:41:42,330 --> 00:41:45,150
the hose if you if okay so

1228
00:41:45,150 --> 00:41:46,680
if every time you add checks your

1229
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:47,880
penis fell off and you had to

1230
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,590
grow it back for two weeks with

1231
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:52,020
digital never have sex again well i

1232
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:53,250
think animals have that situ

1233
00:41:53,250 --> 00:41:55,350
tion i would because sex is great

1234
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:56,280
oh that's right

1235
00:41:57,390 --> 00:41:59,280
i think you could last two weeks

1236
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:01,147
without with your wife when you are

1237
00:42:01,147 --> 00:42:04,860

00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:07,080
sex is i know the idea of

1239
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:08,520
it what you're doing i talked about

1240
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:10,440
this on a previous episode that unfortunately

00:42:19,410 --> 00:42:20,850
it was in the sense that like

1247
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,830
whole quote or whatever and then coop

1248
00:42:22,830 --> 00:42:24,240

1249
00:42:25,410 --> 00:42:28,576

1250
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,390
we're still together we worked it out

1251
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:33,090
when you break it down yeah it's

1252
00:42:33,112 --> 00:42:35,640
like kissing is discussing oh everything crazy

1253
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:37,770

00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:37,950
or you are we allowed to talk

1340
00:45:37,950 --> 00:45:41,310

1341
00:45:41,310 --> 00:45:44,040
okay not anymore shout did you amy

1342
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:47,730
yes thank you um so this song

1343
00:45:47,730 --> 00:45:49,050
was a song where it was really

1344
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:51,570
about like a master fee so exorbitant

1345
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:55,500
how i wanted more than anything you

1346
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:57,630
listening to him i just had this

1347
00:45:57,660 --> 00:46:00,390
urge in my body to like move

1348
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:03,780
my body but not only by myself

1349
00:46:03,810 --> 00:46:05,250
so i think that that was

1350
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:07,500
something that came to me as like

1351
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:10,740
maybe this is a universal feeling that

1352
00:46:11,250 --> 00:46:14,190
you know when when the sun goes

1353
00:46:14,190 --> 00:46:16,290
down and all these things start happening

1354
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:19,560
i just really want that feeling that

1355
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:22,770
when my body moves around the room

1356
00:46:22,770 --> 00:46:25,230
to the music or whatever space i'm

1357
00:46:25,230 --> 00:46:25,410
in

1358
00:46:25,410 --> 00:46:28,140
and i can do that so either

1359
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:29,910
a room or whatever space you might

1360
00:46:29,910 --> 00:46:32,850
be yes and i would like to

1361
00:46:32,970 --> 00:46:35,580
ideally my preference would be to do

1362
00:46:35,580 --> 00:46:36,510
that activity

1363
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:39,000

1364
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:42,450
well whitney when you say you wanna

1365
00:46:42,450 --> 00:46:44,880

better than having too many sketches because

1523
00:52:47,620 --> 00:52:49,690

1524
00:52:49,690 --> 00:52:50,800
like to see what moore's good i
