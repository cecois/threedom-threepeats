just like someone like the the riddle

16
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:48,990

206
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,250
gorgeous it's probably about a year to

207
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:27,600
two years later we have a new

208
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,650
gnome i feel like i have any

209
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:30,720
new gnome my old gnome is right

210
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,130
outside that window and this could go

211
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:33,390
next to it or in a different

212
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:34,560
spot you know that's up to you

213
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,690
maybe they fall in love yeah mines

214
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:39,000
on the porch next to my ah

215
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:41,700
life size tortoise sculpture yeah i think

216
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:44,370
one question that was like the life

217
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:47,160
of the tortoise oh okay so nine

218
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:49,020
times life yes yeah oh my god

219
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:50,569
did they last they last one hundred

220
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:51,419
or the last one hundred years and

221
00:07:51,419 --> 00:07:53,820
they will disintegrate oh it just instantly

222
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:54,720
instantly

223
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,430
early morning urine because you might get

224
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:57,744
some of the fumes you wanted hey

225
00:07:57,744 --> 00:07:59,640
yeah so not questions that i have

226
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:02,670
about the previous nome marvel you know

227
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,102
when i read them any of this

228
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,750
yeah that was joseph scott's anyone like

229
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:08,760
like nine eleven or they like got

230
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,440
coughs afterward have you ever gone to

231
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,850
blow your nose and then you know

232
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:14,670
this too related the tissue you're right

233
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,070
there was a close choice not related

234
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:17,730
to gnomes

235
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,560
now relating to the gnomes if i

236
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,960
got a domain oh what happens you

237
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:24,120
you go to you and hale but

238
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,710
sometimes you inhale some of the tissue

239
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,920
i did not inhale yeah this tissue

240
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:34,080
when i was chopping broccoli ah well

241
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,700
that's exciting warren thank you so much

242
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:37,200
yeah well i don't question about the

243
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,490
nose because if you did say they

244
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:39,840
could fall in love and that you

245
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:42,480
know brings the question up of like

246
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:45,690
the previous nome was just ahead right

247
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:47,520
yes so like what does that mean

248
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:49,560
just for them sexually and then also

249
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:50,160
don't be ably

250
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,990
ist it's not it's not it's he's

251
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:54,690
just ahead he has like nobody at

252
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:57,600
all well i mean that's it's only

253
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,220
one of the orifices you can use

254
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:01,230
i mean the most important one compared

255
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:02,550
to the head of this gnome which

256
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:04,200
is a full-body gnome yeah it's a

257
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,960
big hit yeah right and my other

258
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,310
question is do you think that means

259
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:09,360
the rest of his body is under

260
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:09,900
the dirt

261
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:12,690
under the dirt like we just placed

262
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:13,710
him and then it's able to kind

263
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:15,870
of sprout down every oh yeah around

264
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:17,190
there when you go down there yeah

265
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:19,080
maybe it is growing down into the

266
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,880
everything's brown there when you go down

267
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:24,060
there yeah under the dirt oh you

268
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:25,860
don't get it no you don't know

269
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,150
what the little mermaid is i don't

270
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,050

271
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:30,810

00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:31,800
i actually do get it but i

273
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,210
thought you were should be a dirt

274
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:35,610
little mermaid will hurt me i thought

275
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:37,410

just so hard to tell we'll never

565
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,690
know at this point yeah and people

566
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:19,760
are you know if you vote now

567
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,470
you've already voted in other elections it

568
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:22,490
kind of just goes like well which

569
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:23,750
one did you really mean yeah yeah

570
00:20:23,759 --> 00:20:25,460
your mind like such a good point

571
00:20:25,463 --> 00:20:27,440
i wish i'd say it was typed

572
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,690
every year when voting comes around like

573
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:32,295
like you voted in other elections i

574
00:20:32,295 --> 00:20:33,675
know and i think like if you

575
00:20:33,675 --> 00:20:34,995
voted for this guy before but you're

576
00:20:34,995 --> 00:20:36,585
not voting from this symbol yeah what's

577
00:20:36,585 --> 00:20:38,415
that all about like let's just cancel

578
00:20:38,415 --> 00:20:39,615
every i think just shouldn't do it

579
00:20:39,615 --> 00:20:41,565
anymore so yeah now who do you

580
00:20:41,565 --> 00:20:43,245
think i mean it might just have

581
00:20:43,245 --> 00:20:44,655
to come organically but do you have

582
00:20:44,655 --> 00:20:46,905
someone in mind o a candidate phenomena

583
00:20:46,935 --> 00:20:48,945
because someone to fill this adam yeah

584
00:20:49,755 --> 00:20:50,505
because look clara

585
00:20:50,535 --> 00:20:52,365

586
00:20:52,605 --> 00:20:55,665

it was about a three hour game

717
00:25:28,725 --> 00:25:29,415
and there were so

718
00:25:29,415 --> 00:25:30,555
so many runs it would have taken

719
00:25:30,555 --> 00:25:32,595
four hours without the pitch clock i

720
00:25:32,595 --> 00:25:34,245

739
00:26:06,293 --> 00:26:07,665
some reason that meant you were going

740
00:26:07,665 --> 00:26:08,955
to a game that's right this is

741
00:26:08,955 --> 00:26:09,585
our say the

742
00:26:09,735 --> 00:26:10,745
the photo where we're standing in front

743
00:26:10,745 --> 00:26:13,815
of television yeah we'll can stand in

744
00:26:13,815 --> 00:26:15,402
front of televisions and then get into

745
00:26:15,405 --> 00:26:17,775
a car and go somewhere it's good

746
00:26:17,775 --> 00:26:19,455

the let me tell you thanks to

750
00:26:24,015 --> 00:26:25,455
television and go ahead and this was

751
00:26:25,455 --> 00:26:27,945
a way to lead the tv okay

752
00:26:27,975 --> 00:26:29,175
you gotta read the tv i didn't

753
00:26:29,175 --> 00:26:29,895

754
00:26:30,345 --> 00:26:31,545
and i just saw you with your

755
00:26:31,545 --> 00:26:32,925
base buddy and i thought well they're

756
00:26:32,934 --> 00:26:36,495
often other game well i wish but

757
00:26:36,555 --> 00:26:37,875
i did watch the game together at

758
00:26:37,875 --> 00:26:40,455
my face and the phillies did not

759
00:26:40,455 --> 00:26:42,615
win it was an upsetting turn of

760
00:26:42,615 --> 00:26:44,865
events but not as upsetting as the

761
00:26:44,865 --> 00:26:48,945
following game where the rangers beat them

762
00:26:48,975 --> 00:26:50,055
i think it was

763
00:26:50,055 --> 00:26:54,975
was sixteen to three suddenly oh hi

764
00:26:55,065 --> 00:26:57,735
yas queen leave leave last three of

765
00:26:57,735 --> 00:26:59,955
three games so far that's almost all

766
00:26:59,955 --> 00:27:01,215
of pretty bad too do you ever

767
00:27:01,215 --> 00:27:02,025
bet against them

768
00:27:03,525 --> 00:27:06,285
first of all i don't gamble oh

769
00:27:06,285 --> 00:27:08,115
okay secondly see the thing is is

770
00:27:08,115 --> 00:27:10,095
paul is still hoping to play and

771
00:27:10,095 --> 00:27:11,505
if he has history i came up

772
00:27:11,598 --> 00:27:13,245
black mark on my record

773
00:27:14,325 --> 00:27:15,732
i feel like if i start ice

774
00:27:15,732 --> 00:27:16,635
i know i say this every year

775
00:27:16,815 --> 00:27:18,495
if i start training now you can

776
00:27:18,495 --> 00:27:19,905
get in by by next year i'll

777
00:27:19,935 --> 00:27:21,165
know by the world series this year

778
00:27:22,005 --> 00:27:24,015
i honestly believe you you can not

779
00:27:24,015 --> 00:27:25,935
only play but you'll win with the

780
00:27:25,935 --> 00:27:27,225
amount of knowledge you have about the

781
00:27:27,225 --> 00:27:29,835
sport the passion you know how many

782
00:27:29,835 --> 00:27:31,635
points it takes to win again yeah

783
00:27:31,695 --> 00:27:34,335
one more than one guy that sends

784
00:27:34,575 --> 00:27:36,195
all you need and you just need

785
00:27:36,195 --> 00:27:37,485
to know where to throw the ball

786
00:27:38,752 --> 00:27:40,125
straight up and share or not to

787
00:27:40,125 --> 00:27:42,138
throw the ball that's right yeah because

788
00:27:42,138 --> 00:27:43,575
if it will come down if you

789
00:27:43,575 --> 00:27:44,835
throw it straight up in the yes

790
00:27:44,865 --> 00:27:46,095
and sometimes it'll bunk you on the

791
00:27:46,095 --> 00:27:47,685
head how to hit the ball you

792
00:27:47,745 --> 00:27:49,185
want to hit it outwards you don't

793
00:27:49,185 --> 00:27:51,195
want to like collaborate you don't feel

794
00:27:51,195 --> 00:27:53,835
like it has virtually no yeah wait

795
00:27:53,955 --> 00:27:56,415
do you like baseball i like baseball

796
00:27:56,565 --> 00:27:57,915
i've been going to games my whole

797
00:27:57,915 --> 00:27:58,695
life so when

798
00:27:58,725 --> 00:28:01,506
credulous i know you don't like baseball

799
00:28:01,525 --> 00:28:03,135
you just felt like you weren't someone

800
00:28:03,135 --> 00:28:05,175
who would throw that on throw it

801
00:28:05,175 --> 00:28:06,615
on what does that mean oh hey

802
00:28:06,615 --> 00:28:08,205
bug ball games i'm gonna i'm gonna

803
00:28:08,205 --> 00:28:09,405
check that i'm not a i'm not

804
00:28:09,405 --> 00:28:11,175
a guy who's like that's my identity

805
00:28:11,415 --> 00:28:13,335
right but ah nor am i to

806
00:28:13,335 --> 00:28:14,955
be clear i mean jason barnes

807
00:28:15,825 --> 00:28:17,355
kind of made things part of jason

808
00:28:17,355 --> 00:28:19,605
bourne was a huge baseball fan do

809
00:28:19,605 --> 00:28:20,745
you think he's good i think his

810
00:28:20,745 --> 00:28:22,485
identity was combined now he's dead

811
00:28:23,685 --> 00:28:25,155
while he was looking for his identity

812
00:28:25,155 --> 00:28:26,235
right he didn't know he was jason

813
00:28:26,235 --> 00:28:27,915
bourne or some shit actually don't know

814
00:28:27,975 --> 00:28:29,355
i think there hasn't there hasn't been

815
00:28:29,355 --> 00:28:31,695
a sql in a number of years

816
00:28:31,695 --> 00:28:32,805
so he has to be dead that's

817
00:28:32,805 --> 00:28:34,515
why there hasn't been a sql hey

818
00:28:34,545 --> 00:28:35,775
guys you probably figured out as i

819
00:28:35,779 --> 00:28:37,155
make sure his identity he felt like

820
00:28:37,155 --> 00:28:38,415
it was kind of the case closed

821
00:28:38,415 --> 00:28:39,465
well i think he figured out as

822
00:28:39,465 --> 00:28:41,115
identity yeah first one she jumped in

823
00:28:41,115 --> 00:28:42,255
the she was like oh wait i'm

824
00:28:42,255 --> 00:28:43,335
a killer for the cia

825
00:28:43,335 --> 00:28:44,865
a or whatever yeah right i forget

826
00:28:44,865 --> 00:28:46,082
now i'm very hazy on the content

827
00:28:46,082 --> 00:28:47,985
of the next couple were like yeah

828
00:28:47,985 --> 00:28:48,975
i'm a killer for the seat you

829
00:28:48,975 --> 00:28:50,445
know i've only seen one second of

830
00:28:50,445 --> 00:28:51,525
one of those movies and it's when

831
00:28:51,525 --> 00:28:52,935
like mini cooper is going down some

832
00:28:52,935 --> 00:28:54,705
stairs in italy or something and that's

833
00:28:54,705 --> 00:28:56,505
premature like god isn't that the italian

834
00:28:56,535 --> 00:28:57,915
nazi italian yeah there you go

835
00:29:00,075 --> 00:29:01,665
is that really who knows maybe well

836
00:29:01,665 --> 00:29:03,165
the italian job famously had a mini

837
00:29:03,165 --> 00:29:05,085
cooper chase both in the original and

838
00:29:05,115 --> 00:29:06,435
does the board and any heavy cars

839
00:29:06,435 --> 00:29:09,045
going down italian or like european sadly

840
00:29:09,135 --> 00:29:10,995
i bet it does maybe cooper going

841
00:29:10,995 --> 00:29:15,165
down stairs movie good i'm looking i

842
00:29:15,165 --> 00:29:16,605
think it's greedy terrible to do this

843
00:29:16,605 --> 00:29:18,465
kind of stuff i think by that

844
00:29:18,465 --> 00:29:19,095
i mean not

845
00:29:19,275 --> 00:29:20,955
italian job the italian job the italian

846
00:29:21,045 --> 00:29:23,715
your every thought you have you just

847
00:29:23,715 --> 00:29:27,495
go mini cooper going downstairs and movie

848
00:29:27,525 --> 00:29:28,965
well and then it's like resolved you're

849
00:29:28,965 --> 00:29:31,455
like alright like i don't like to

850
00:29:31,515 --> 00:29:32,805
i do i do that for every

851
00:29:32,805 --> 00:29:34,605
thought but this time it matches up

852
00:29:34,695 --> 00:29:36,435
and i think that's great i'm happy

853
00:29:36,435 --> 00:29:38,085
i'm wrong i'm happy you're right i

854
00:29:38,085 --> 00:29:39,225
just i just

855
00:29:39,255 --> 00:29:41,955
think sometimes sometimes we should just be

856
00:29:41,955 --> 00:29:44,955
saying many cooper going downstairs movie yeah

857
00:29:45,015 --> 00:29:45,975
let me ask you are you guys

858
00:29:45,975 --> 00:29:48,435
going to use chat gbt to write

859
00:29:48,675 --> 00:29:50,865
paulo write your standard packs yes yeah

860
00:29:50,925 --> 00:29:53,385
lauren to write your movies yeah probably

861
00:29:53,385 --> 00:29:54,945
i think it's just seems like it's

862
00:29:54,945 --> 00:29:56,475
going really well and no i honestly

863
00:29:56,505 --> 00:29:58,245
like i was kinda like it's not

864
00:29:58,245 --> 00:29:59,415
a bad idea to just

865
00:29:59,445 --> 00:30:00,913
use it to write first draft it

866
00:30:00,913 --> 00:30:02,648
seems to be things like let's make

867
00:30:02,661 --> 00:30:04,485
a little funnier as a little joke

868
00:30:04,815 --> 00:30:08,685

00:32:09,775 --> 00:32:11,575
fun moment in time but this feels

923
00:32:11,575 --> 00:32:13,045
like that where it's kind of like

924
00:32:13,315 --> 00:32:15,025
interacting with a bot and then the

925
00:32:15,055 --> 00:32:16,705

anymore after one thousand years so yes

967
00:33:46,163 --> 00:33:48,205
she's methuselah it has been like twenty

00:33:48,205 --> 00:33:50,616
plus years she's been on here forever

969
00:33:50,726 --> 00:33:52,375
must be so weird to be on

970
00:33:52,465 --> 00:33:54,505
the same show for twenty eight years

971
00:33:54,505 --> 00:33:55,795
somebody you don't care about and they're

972
00:33:55,795 --> 00:33:57,175
paying you so much money you've seen

973
00:33:57,175 --> 00:33:59,815
almost the entire cast turnover yeah yeah

974
00:33:59,815 --> 00:34:01,465
i'm sure that would be on the

975
00:34:01,465 --> 00:34:03,595
or billy wow yeah to because they

976
00:34:03,625 --> 00:34:06,535
trust you right after twenty years yeah

977
00:34:06,565 --> 00:34:08,755
okay so how much money is like

978
00:34:08,755 --> 00:34:11,517
twentieth season it's like malia and lydia

979
00:34:11,517 --> 00:34:13,675
show hundred dollars an episode so yeah

980
00:34:13,765 --> 00:34:17,095
so two thousand dollars yeah so okay

981
00:34:17,095 --> 00:34:19,075
so a guy's sticks out in a

982
00:34:19,075 --> 00:34:21,625
girl's goes yes huh and so

983
00:34:22,525 --> 00:34:24,205
so and that's how they fit together

984
00:34:24,205 --> 00:34:25,885
right right but then

985
00:34:26,995 --> 00:34:29,605
for my practice actually not sure but

986
00:34:29,605 --> 00:34:32,455
then for oral sex right a guy's

987
00:34:32,485 --> 00:34:34,825
sticks out and girls goes in much

988
00:34:34,825 --> 00:34:37,525
like the much like the ah their

989
00:34:37,555 --> 00:34:39,715
their private parts okay but when in

990
00:34:39,715 --> 00:34:42,985
reverse shouldn't a guy's mouth stick out

991
00:34:43,045 --> 00:34:45,565
ill so we have like big like

992
00:34:45,565 --> 00:34:46,345
no bills

993
00:34:48,595 --> 00:34:50,725
like tongue i think we should get

994
00:34:50,725 --> 00:34:54,085
yeah ask love to come in here

995
00:34:54,535 --> 00:34:55,225
huh

996
00:34:55,225 --> 00:34:57,445
huh she agree with me and any

997
00:34:57,925 --> 00:34:59,155
time you hear this i mean she'd

998
00:34:59,155 --> 00:34:59,845
never hear this pop

999
00:35:03,475 --> 00:35:04,915
how do you guys feel about that

1000
00:35:04,915 --> 00:35:07,495
about your children ever discovering this yeah

1001
00:35:07,497 --> 00:35:12,235
i'll be gone oh yeah star um

1002
00:35:12,265 --> 00:35:14,965
i feel okay about it i think

1003
00:35:14,965 --> 00:35:16,945
it's okay i think it's by that

1004
00:35:16,945 --> 00:35:18,235
point she'll pretty much know what my

1005
00:35:18,235 --> 00:35:19,795
sense of humor is so i think

1006
00:35:19,795 --> 00:35:21,145
it's safe to say none of it

1007
00:35:21,175 --> 00:35:22,705
would be too surprising but what if

1008
00:35:22,705 --> 00:35:24,175
i played for her when she's like

1009
00:35:24,295 --> 00:35:26,245
seven now i'd probably be pretty bad

1010
00:35:28,015 --> 00:35:29,905
there'll be like an armed guard there

1011
00:35:29,905 --> 00:35:31,795
so we don't be in a bank

1012
00:35:31,795 --> 00:35:33,805
vault oh no it's not worth your

1013
00:35:33,805 --> 00:35:35,485
they're playing a podcast for my daughter

1014
00:35:35,485 --> 00:35:37,465
alone will take that figure to a

1015
00:35:37,465 --> 00:35:39,685
bank vault where he has a safety

1016
00:35:39,685 --> 00:35:41,725
deposit box he unlocks it pulls it

1017
00:35:41,725 --> 00:35:43,525
out there's a taper for ice storm

1018
00:35:43,525 --> 00:35:46,135
style party or like all the adults

1019
00:35:46,135 --> 00:35:47,545
are drunk yeah it's like

1020
00:35:47,575 --> 00:35:48,865
come in come in here come here

1021
00:35:48,955 --> 00:35:50,335
i need you to hear this yeah

1022
00:35:50,365 --> 00:35:52,044
that's your mom this is your mom

1023
00:35:52,045 --> 00:35:53,905
daddy you gotta hear this you hear

1024
00:35:53,905 --> 00:35:55,285

1025
00:35:55,315 --> 00:35:58,255
elfa saying that's your mommy that's your

1026
00:35:58,255 --> 00:36:01,162
sick sick mom i think i think

1027
00:36:01,165 --> 00:36:02,305
a kid would be proud of i

1028
00:36:02,305 --> 00:36:03,865
don't know who knows i think so

1029
00:36:04,045 --> 00:36:05,335
but i think most times a lot

1030
00:36:05,335 --> 00:36:07,135
of times kids are embarrassed by what

1031
00:36:07,135 --> 00:36:07,675
their parents do

1032
00:36:07,735 --> 00:36:08,935
oh yeah that's what it is so

1033
00:36:08,935 --> 00:36:10,315
who cares well but it but if

1034
00:36:10,315 --> 00:36:12,715
we're doing something taboo like yeah kind

1035
00:36:12,715 --> 00:36:13,825
of stuff then i think they'd think

1036
00:36:13,825 --> 00:36:16,585
it was cool maybe who i'm curious

1037
00:36:16,615 --> 00:36:18,205

1199
00:41:31,585 --> 00:41:33,685
here's the problem with that because this

1200
00:41:33,685 --> 00:41:34,735
is the this is the real problem

1201
00:41:34,735 --> 00:41:36,985
with that i need her to decide

1202
00:41:36,985 --> 00:41:39,685
within a week or two because you're

1203
00:41:39,715 --> 00:41:41,035
setting your plans for freedom

1204
00:41:42,325 --> 00:41:44,785
no because she may not know who

1205
00:41:44,785 --> 00:41:46,015
any of us are no this show

1206
00:41:46,015 --> 00:41:47,545
is oh that can't be hold on

1207
00:41:47,575 --> 00:41:50,065
hey that's okay but let's say she

1208
00:41:50,065 --> 00:41:51,925
didn't know right and she she has

1209
00:41:51,925 --> 00:41:53,005
to be willing to come on without

1210
00:41:53,005 --> 00:41:55,045
really having much time to research i

1211
00:41:55,045 --> 00:41:56,695
don't want it to be made may

1212
00:41:56,695 --> 00:41:58,165
and she's listened to the whole backlog

1213
00:41:58,165 --> 00:41:59,785
and she's coming on throwing out references

1214
00:41:59,785 --> 00:42:01,225
like she's always been a fan i

1215
00:42:01,225 --> 00:42:02,185
wanna know

1216
00:42:02,515 --> 00:42:05,095
the facts of her where she's at

1217
00:42:05,095 --> 00:42:06,505
with what she knows about us so

1218
00:42:06,505 --> 00:42:07,675
we need like she wants to talk

1219
00:42:07,675 --> 00:42:09,145
about what topic she's bringing we need

1220
00:42:09,145 --> 00:42:10,345
to make sure there's not enough time

1221
00:42:10,345 --> 00:42:12,025
for her to binge all the previous

1222
00:42:12,025 --> 00:42:14,035
yeah yeah that's good so i think

1223
00:42:14,035 --> 00:42:15,205
it has to just be within one

1224
00:42:15,205 --> 00:42:16,285
to two weeks where does she live

1225
00:42:16,285 --> 00:42:17,635

1226
00:42:17,765 --> 00:42:19,403

towel into the bathroom yeah for her

1313
00:44:58,315 --> 00:44:59,335

1315
00:45:02,155 --> 00:45:05,215

00:45:05,215 --> 00:45:06,595
the look is like through the spring

1317
00:45:06,625 --> 00:45:07,945

them that do move a little bit

1321
00:45:14,215 --> 00:45:15,925
so when you stay yes so when

1322
00:45:15,925 --> 00:45:16,135

1589
00:53:11,455 --> 00:53:12,955
a biscuit on top of it actually

1590
00:53:12,955 --> 00:53:14,125
i guess i could do that yeah

1591
00:53:14,155 --> 00:53:15,025
i mean there'll be a lot of

1592
00:53:15,025 --> 00:53:16,405
chain left over because no one's eating

1593
00:53:16,405 --> 00:53:17,785
the chickens know what that is you

1594
00:53:17,875 --> 00:53:19,585
don't allow asia chicken just give us

1595
00:53:19,585 --> 00:53:21,175
motivation yeah exactly because you get really

1596
00:53:21,175 --> 00:53:22,255
hungry during the record and then of

1597
00:53:22,255 --> 00:53:25,555
course you're funnier yeah but page okay

1598
00:53:25,585 --> 00:53:26,275
i should get to be clear

1599
00:53:26,275 --> 00:53:27,865
or to page she's unexpected to be

1600
00:53:27,865 --> 00:53:30,115
funny on the show oh he's expected

1601
00:53:30,145 --> 00:53:31,615
she also wouldn't kill her to be

1602
00:53:31,615 --> 00:53:33,415
a little funny well look she's naturally

1603
00:53:33,445 --> 00:53:35,035
funny but i'm saying she's a pressure

1604
00:53:35,035 --> 00:53:36,955
we would like that horse but it's

1605
00:53:36,955 --> 00:53:39,835
not honestly if she's not hilarious on

1606
00:53:39,835 --> 00:53:41,935
it we'd be a little disappointed here's

1607
00:53:41,935 --> 00:53:43,195
the thing though we reserve the right

1608
00:53:43,195 --> 00:53:45,895
to scrap the episode yeah so if

1609
00:53:45,895 --> 00:53:46,435
we don't want

1610
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:47,905
put it out you don't have and

1611
00:53:47,905 --> 00:53:50,605
we should we also page you should

1612
00:53:50,605 --> 00:53:52,225
know that after the episode we're gonna

1613
00:53:52,225 --> 00:53:53,785
judge it and say how she did

1614
00:53:53,905 --> 00:53:55,885
to her face well yeah yeah yeah

1615
00:53:55,885 --> 00:53:57,355
we'll give a first thumb that'll be

1616
00:53:57,355 --> 00:53:59,365
a bonus focus yeah reaction yeah yeah

1617
00:53:59,365 --> 00:54:00,295
and kind of it will be like

1618
00:54:00,385 --> 00:54:03,055
trading spaces reveal yeah we reveal how

1619
00:54:03,055 --> 00:54:04,705
we felt about her appearance sometimes people

1620
00:54:04,705 --> 00:54:06,085
didn't like the house when they came

1621
00:54:06,085 --> 00:54:06,595
back you know

1622
00:54:06,595 --> 00:54:08,215
no and sometimes they loved it why

1623
00:54:08,215 --> 00:54:09,865
don't we ever stand behind a bus

1624
00:54:10,075 --> 00:54:11,545
yeah and when we're ready to give

1625
00:54:11,545 --> 00:54:13,855
our verdict we'll hold our thumbs up

1626
00:54:14,095 --> 00:54:15,685
or down when the bus moves she

1627
00:54:15,685 --> 00:54:17,365
can see yes we will drive to

1628
00:54:17,365 --> 00:54:19,135
the greyhound station she'll make her own

1629
00:54:19,135 --> 00:54:21,265
way there and and then we'll find

1630
00:54:21,265 --> 00:54:22,645
a bus that's about to take off

1631
00:54:23,245 --> 00:54:25,585
take it so hard to time because

1632
00:54:25,585 --> 00:54:26,725
occasion is yeah

1633
00:54:26,845 --> 00:54:28,765
occasionally you're standing behind that bus yeah

1634
00:54:28,795 --> 00:54:31,135
like twenty minutes remove that bus until

1635
00:54:31,135 --> 00:54:33,505
it moves it won't move yeah yeah

1636
00:54:33,565 --> 00:54:35,515
or until we're removed yeah if you

1637
00:54:35,515 --> 00:54:36,955

1692
00:56:24,355 --> 00:56:26,905
um it was john ross valley and

1693
00:56:26,905 --> 00:56:30,355
a puppeteer who was the movements of

1694
00:56:30,355 --> 00:56:31,405
the puppet and i was the voice

1695
00:56:31,405 --> 00:56:34,225
of the puppet yeah and the idea

1696
00:56:34,225 --> 00:56:35,305
was that the puppet was the new

1697
00:56:35,305 --> 00:56:37,855
spokesperson for ford focus and john ross

1698
00:56:37,855 --> 00:56:39,085
bowie was a guy who worked for

1699
00:56:39,085 --> 00:56:41,395
ford and was there to like roy

1700
00:56:41,395 --> 00:56:45,805
wrangle this very unconventional guy the puppet

1701
00:56:46,495 --> 00:56:50,425
and um we did these ah bits

1702
00:56:50,425 --> 00:56:53,515
where we would drive somebody around and

1703

people playing characters driving the car and

1709
00:57:05,005 --> 00:57:07,015
then the puppeteer would be in the

1710
00:57:07,015 --> 00:57:08,905
back seat and so the puppet was

1711
00:57:08,905 --> 00:57:11,095

a eulogy that they are willfully unprepared

1771
00:59:32,485 --> 00:59:34,645
for the other to come up with

1772
00:59:34,645 --> 00:59:36,625
a famous person real or fictional who

1773
00:59:36,625 --> 00:59:39,955

1774
00:59:39,955 --> 00:59:41,185

1775
00:59:41,305 --> 00:59:42,925

1777
00:59:46,075 --> 00:59:48,025
that's backing the wind that's better yeah

1778
00:59:48,025 --> 00:59:50,515
who cares who's curious about where to

1779
00:59:50,605 --> 00:59:52,675
maybe i've been where my knee is

1780
00:59:52,675 --> 00:59:54,685
probably covered the house yeah but why

1781
00:59:56,035 --> 00:59:57,415
well because all things must die and

1782
00:59:57,415 --> 00:59:59,455

01:00:03,715 --> 01:00:04,825
they are on the right track the

1786
01:00:04,825 --> 01:00:06,445
congregation says amen

1787
01:00:07,075 --> 01:00:08,635
if they are saying something wrong the

1788
01:00:08,635 --> 01:00:10,915
congregation clears their throats and if the

1789
01:00:10,915 --> 01:00:12,415
pastor is spot on with any of

1790
01:00:12,415 --> 01:00:16,135
the important details the congregation hollers hallelujah

1791
01:00:16,225 --> 01:00:18,055

1792
01:00:18,055 --> 01:00:19,555
with anything the congregation may feel the

1793
01:00:19,555 --> 01:00:21,715
holy spirit through them and say something

1794
01:00:21,715 --> 01:00:23,215

01:08:02,560 --> 01:08:06,070
minutes or so specific date with theater

1954
01:08:06,070 --> 01:08:07,651
yeah theory theory

1955
01:08:09,790 --> 01:08:11,140
alright where do we how do we

1956
01:08:11,140 --> 01:08:13,090
know that he's dead didn't know we're

1957
01:08:13,090 --> 01:08:15,550
just supposed we're no no there's that

1958
01:08:15,550 --> 01:08:16,870
was never a rule that he died

1959
01:08:16,900 --> 01:08:18,520
but let's do another round that was

1960
01:08:18,520 --> 01:08:20,890
great let's do another round who wants

1961
01:08:20,890 --> 01:08:22,600
to be it i assumed he was

1962
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:25,420
a well-known thing that we also knew

1963
01:08:25,420 --> 01:08:27,361
how this personnel i know because i'd

1964
01:08:27,361 --> 01:08:28,720
be a famous person that we

1965
01:08:28,870 --> 01:08:30,250
no we're making it like tom cruise

1966
01:08:30,370 --> 01:08:33,580
items yeah we're making okay oh okay

1967
01:08:33,730 --> 01:08:36,850
who wants to go youtube great but

1968
01:08:36,850 --> 01:08:38,200
hold on a second if they if

1969
01:08:38,200 --> 01:08:40,900
they should we restricted to people who

1970
01:08:40,900 --> 01:08:42,333
are actually dead to me i think

1971
01:08:42,340 --> 01:08:44,740
it was a little faster people who

1972
01:08:44,770 --> 01:08:47,950
are i've i think i've just twenty

1973
01:08:47,950 --> 01:08:48,970
questions where you're trying to

1974
01:08:49,060 --> 01:08:50,530
i think if you lie per se

1975
01:08:50,725 --> 01:08:52,655
and also how they died yeah let's

1976
01:08:52,655 --> 01:08:54,610
just yeah let's do that i assumed

1977
01:08:54,610 --> 01:08:56,530
that it was somebody who had actually

1978
01:08:56,530 --> 01:08:58,270
died that would have made sense

1979
01:08:59,470 --> 01:09:01,060
it's not even a real person but

1980
01:09:01,060 --> 01:09:02,710
i mean i'm proposing why don't we

1981
01:09:02,710 --> 01:09:05,080
do that because it will mean easier

1982
01:09:05,080 --> 01:09:06,850
we need or like oh i think

1983
01:09:06,850 --> 01:09:08,650
not even harder because i don't know

1984
01:09:08,650 --> 01:09:11,590
who died yeah i think it's ten

1985
01:09:11,590 --> 01:09:13,270
you're still playing the same way now

1986
01:09:13,270 --> 01:09:15,160
i think it's easier to to be

1987
01:09:15,336 --> 01:09:17,350
anyone because also if you know how

1988
01:09:17,350 --> 01:09:19,060
the person died then there's none of

1989
01:09:19,060 --> 01:09:19,480
the guessing

1990
01:09:19,510 --> 01:09:21,160
about how the person died and because

1991
01:09:21,370 --> 01:09:23,800
fun as these two things fake game

1992
01:09:24,910 --> 01:09:26,050
well how would i ever have guessed

1993
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:28,210
diphtheria well that's insane

1994
01:09:28,840 --> 01:09:31,360
yeah i don't know maybe you say

1995
01:09:31,360 --> 01:09:32,980
like he had stomach problems and then

1996
01:09:32,980 --> 01:09:34,300
we go amen and amen

1997
01:09:35,410 --> 01:09:36,670
i was never going to get there

1998
01:09:36,940 --> 01:09:39,670
but lets you text me a person
