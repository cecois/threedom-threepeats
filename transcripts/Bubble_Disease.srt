00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:40,530
you have to never do that again

45
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,940

then we all just got in the

189
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:18,000
car went to urgent care

190
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:20,250
which i'm really glad we did because

191
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:22,860
we holly loved it she oh she

192
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:24,420
was crash she had a great time

193
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:27,210
i could hear her laughing from the

194
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:28,761
room that i was still having a

195
00:06:28,761 --> 00:06:31,410
lot of fun um but we got

196
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:33,150
there and and did they say if

197
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:34,740
you had been sixty seconds later you

198
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:35,880
would have lost your hand what can

199
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,500
i say actually it sounds a little

200
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,440
extreme but my finger was blue oh

201
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:43,020
and then they were like it's tied

202
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:44,262
too tight which we of course they

203
00:06:44,262 --> 00:06:45,450
always say do it so tight

204
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,630
yeah strike me yeah but then they

205
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:50,100
were concerned she literally was like if

206
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:50,880
you left i mean i don't know

207
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,780
how long it would have to be

208
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:52,530
but she was like if you left

209
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:53,430
it like this you could have lost

210
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:55,140
your finger oh and like maybe if

211
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:56,250
i wasn't smart enough to go to

212
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:57,300
the urgent care i would like gone

213
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,770
to sleep or you know who know

214
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:00,031
but i was really terrified of that

215
00:07:00,031 --> 00:07:00,960
so that's a good tip for anyone

216
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,370
out there don't go too tight but

217
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:03,240
i thought he was doing right i

218
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,560
mean we both felt very yeah you're

219
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,760
sound like it was probably

220
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:08,310
to cut off the yeah yeah it

221
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:10,080
was bleeding so much i'm so crazy

222
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,850
so it made sense but anyway it

223
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:14,550
was too tight which finger my index

224
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:15,960
fingers right here if it had been

225
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,280
your thumb you have a major artery

226
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,200
and your thumb is that true no

227
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:23,190
anyway so the i didn't ever look

228
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:26,100
at it and they the woman doctor

229
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,120
came in and doctor was a woman

230
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:28,620
what's bizarre

231
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:30,630
most shocking part of the story she

232
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:32,010
could operate on you because you're not

233
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:35,130
related exactly yeah and she stitched it

234
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:37,350
up i got three stitches and i

235
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:39,540
could feel it at a certain point

236
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:41,040
the light cane was wearing off in

237
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:41,940
one part of my hand and i

238
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:44,310
was like oh she's like are you

239
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:45,540
feel that and i was like yeah

240
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:46,320
and then she tried give me a

241
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,850
shot and i still felt it but

242
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:48,960
i will say having your whole

243
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:50,490
vagina sewn up does put things into

244
00:07:50,502 --> 00:07:51,120
perspective

245
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:55,200
an abrupt subject change

246
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:58,770
and you had that as to not

247
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:00,210

of the deepest cut i ever had

312
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:50,340
the first thing that comes to mind

313
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:52,590
is when i was a bachelor and

314
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:54,960

had to start all over again at

322
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:10,940
some point yes of course because you

323
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:12,500

00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:53,720

378
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,980

00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:16,880
my god and so that was definitely

381
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:17,870
a drug to warn you i made

382
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:18,080
these

383
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,470
that's horrible yeah that was a bad

384
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:24,650
one ah so bad why your sweatshirt

385
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:26,428
says twenty four it says eight twenty

386
00:12:26,428 --> 00:12:28,040
twentieth so h when i got there

387
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,480
i don't know what i'd worry about

388
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:31,310
production company company because i know a

389
00:12:31,325 --> 00:12:32,951
twenty four is a production company but

390
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,700
it is something they make like movies

391
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:37,130
and stuff it's jack bauer hwy twenty

392
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:39,020
four big hit because it's it's a

393
00:12:39,037 --> 00:12:39,260
twenty

394
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:41,870
for big head we should always just

395
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:43,610
parodies of these yeah cause everyone will

396
00:12:43,612 --> 00:12:46,760
get that yes it's basic switch when

397
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,620
eight twenty four gives them out for

398
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:50,480
yes we ever also give them to

399
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,190
a twenty two the same people yes

400
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:53,300
yeah let's spend all of our own

401
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,190
money doing that absolutely

402
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:58,700
i think the trickiest part is getting

403
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:00,650
a twenty four to share their contact

404
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:03,380

00:21:29,155 --> 00:21:32,605
so billy joel's the strangler um do

667
00:21:32,605 --> 00:21:36,055
you think that anyone made coasters featuring

668
00:21:36,445 --> 00:21:37,435
the coasters

669
00:21:38,125 --> 00:21:39,235
i don't think so that would be

670
00:21:39,235 --> 00:21:42,295
so disrespectful to them and i think

671
00:21:42,295 --> 00:21:43,825
someone should do it now by the

672
00:21:43,825 --> 00:21:45,295
way we're okay so here's a question

673
00:21:45,295 --> 00:21:47,067
that can also yeah what what why

674
00:21:47,067 --> 00:21:48,625
did they call the coasters that's what

675
00:21:48,625 --> 00:21:50,215
i mean in our day the roller

676
00:21:50,215 --> 00:21:52,105
coasters are they the coasters you put

677
00:21:52,105 --> 00:21:53,635
a glass on it's less cool if

678
00:21:53,635 --> 00:21:55,165
they're the coasters you political are they

679
00:21:55,165 --> 00:21:56,755
just people that little i don't post

680
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:58,135
yeah think they're people

681
00:21:58,165 --> 00:22:00,475
who coast through life that's less cool

682
00:22:00,475 --> 00:22:01,977
to me to know i think it's

683
00:22:02,331 --> 00:22:04,645
cool like roller coasters or drink coast

684
00:22:04,675 --> 00:22:06,355
i think that i think they must

685
00:22:06,355 --> 00:22:08,275
be the coasters like the like the

686
00:22:08,455 --> 00:22:09,715
the roller but let's look them up

687
00:22:09,715 --> 00:22:11,815
what do you say sure i have

688
00:22:11,815 --> 00:22:13,495
nothing else to fucking do yeah i

689
00:22:13,495 --> 00:22:15,215
don't care i don't care

690
00:22:16,435 --> 00:22:19,225
because i gotta say i don't care

691
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:21,325
i may have done premium blend twice

692
00:22:21,595 --> 00:22:22,705
i've you know what i bet you

693
00:22:22,705 --> 00:22:23,575

694
00:22:23,665 --> 00:22:25,615
i'm not chased to watch it okay

695
00:22:25,645 --> 00:22:28,255
i did remember a list oh wait

696
00:22:28,255 --> 00:22:30,295
what's that that was that was where

697
00:22:30,475 --> 00:22:32,485
like before they were doing those comedy

698
00:22:32,485 --> 00:22:34,555
half hours that was like long it

699
00:22:34,555 --> 00:22:36,445
was still a bunch of comedians but

700
00:22:36,445 --> 00:22:36,535
it

701
00:22:36,608 --> 00:22:38,755
be longer sets i think ah huh

702
00:22:38,845 --> 00:22:40,345
it would be like three comedians instead

703
00:22:40,345 --> 00:22:42,355
of six or something like that like

704
00:22:42,355 --> 00:22:44,575
imagine a tiny penis and then imagine

705
00:22:44,575 --> 00:22:46,285
a big penis i can't and it's

706
00:22:46,315 --> 00:22:48,445
in their friends yeah i can't say

707
00:22:48,445 --> 00:22:49,405
i have it by the way it's

708
00:22:49,615 --> 00:22:50,995
none of the ones that we know

709
00:22:50,995 --> 00:22:52,855
it's so different but it's none of

710
00:22:52,855 --> 00:22:54,715

716
00:23:08,005 --> 00:23:10,105

889
00:28:57,475 --> 00:28:59,215

890
00:28:59,215 --> 00:29:02,245
somewhere and then up it wasn't there

891
00:29:02,485 --> 00:29:04,855

bubble remember but

979
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,190

disease bubbles in your blood yeah somebody

982
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:00,440
touch you when you cut open your

983
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,880
hand you are able to get rid

984
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,467
of all the bubbles yeah the combination

985
00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:05,840
is spilled and floated to the ceiling

986
00:32:06,950 --> 00:32:07,940

987
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:09,410
bubbles might go to my brain

988
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:13,670

00:32:13,687 --> 00:32:16,070
how was your christmas my christmas was

990
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:17,330
good all i could think about was

991
00:32:17,330 --> 00:32:19,130
having an injection and then there will

992
00:32:19,130 --> 00:32:20,690
be air bubble in there yeah would

993
00:32:20,690 --> 00:32:22,730
kill me right um oh that's really

994
00:32:22,730 --> 00:32:26,750
scary all christmas all christmas all christmas

995
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:29,930
i thought of my fear um objections

996
00:32:29,930 --> 00:32:30,650
in my rear

997
00:32:31,730 --> 00:32:32,150
ceo

998
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:32,780
up here

999
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:39,560
what is really maybe you've looked at

1000
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:40,610
the sea like what if in willy

1001
00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:44,630
wonka instead of dream this harmony thing

1002
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:45,680
is like you got you need an

1003
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:46,160
injection

1004
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:50,720
you're but let's probably too behind the

1005
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,100
scenes on ejection

1006
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:58,700
because in the right and everybody out

1007
00:32:58,809 --> 00:33:00,530
it's an injection that yeah if it's

1008
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:02,270
entering your rectum i don't know if

1009
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:03,410
that's an issue it's like a hot

1010
00:33:03,410 --> 00:33:05,720
beef injection they call an objection yeah

1011
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:08,840

legendary thing when we were kids that

was like this cartoon was like rated

1324
00:43:50,445 --> 00:43:52,875
x it was rated movie yeah that's

1325
00:43:52,875 --> 00:43:56,295
so that's so nineties yeah that's so

1326
00:43:56,295 --> 00:43:57,915
nineties although this was the eighties but

1327
00:43:57,915 --> 00:43:59,685
people don't say anything is rated x

1328
00:43:59,685 --> 00:44:01,275
now you just go

1329
00:44:01,365 --> 00:44:03,195
it just is no yeah do you

1330
00:44:03,195 --> 00:44:04,635
remember finding out the triple x is

1331
00:44:04,665 --> 00:44:06,568
meaningless like there's no yeah there's there's

1332
00:44:06,585 --> 00:44:08,805
no there there well there's there should

1333

be a double x this is so

1334
00:44:10,665 --> 00:44:13,275
filthy because there are no movies that

1335

1336
00:44:15,315 --> 00:44:16,875
real like hole in the market that

1337
00:44:16,875 --> 00:44:18,045

crimes and i met him but i

1464
00:48:28,245 --> 00:48:29,544

1465
00:48:29,745 --> 00:48:30,765
i know because it got so weird

1466
00:48:30,855 --> 00:48:32,685
we really thought someone was murdered with

1467
00:48:32,685 --> 00:48:33,915
a rubber chicken and it was just

1468
00:48:34,098 --> 00:48:35,025
like two hundred

1469
00:48:35,145 --> 00:48:36,735
yeah oh yeah no i get it

1470
00:48:37,005 --> 00:48:39,285
retrospect call attention to data okay buh

00:48:39,311 --> 00:48:41,055
that was the worst part um

1472
00:48:41,865 --> 00:48:43,305
yeah i'm just talking what here first

1473
00:48:43,305 --> 00:48:44,655
of all you're much taller than i

1474
00:48:44,655 --> 00:48:46,365
thought you look so small on instagram

1475
00:48:46,635 --> 00:48:47,895
i know well what i do is

00:48:47,895 --> 00:48:49,245
i put i put the camera really

1477
00:48:49,245 --> 00:48:51,825
far away okay so yeah i'm retract

1478

close to the camera got it okay

1482
00:49:00,075 --> 00:49:01,695

1486
00:49:04,695 --> 00:49:06,975
the place and anyone who is not

yeah um okay well we haven't put

1492
00:49:16,155 --> 00:49:18,075

00:49:18,075 --> 00:49:21,165
is this fifty people were murdered this

1494
00:49:21,165 --> 00:49:22,185

eighty where a mermaid performer was crawling

1496
00:49:26,595 --> 00:49:28,395
out from the ocean this is kind

1497
00:49:28,395 --> 00:49:30,045
of standard obviously we're on the beach

1498
00:49:30,045 --> 00:49:32,535
right um yeah obviously she crawled up

1499
00:49:32,535 --> 00:49:33,975
from the ocean called up from the

1500
00:49:33,975 --> 00:49:37,065
ocean performance she was it was supposed

1501
00:49:37,065 --> 00:49:38,145
to be like she was supposed to

1502
00:49:38,145 --> 00:49:40,755
take her legs off her her fishtail

1503
00:49:40,755 --> 00:49:42,285

couldn't get her legs off yeah and

1506
00:49:47,175 --> 00:49:49,485
fit her fin she yeah she couldn't

1507
00:49:49,485 --> 00:49:50,955

around and that's all we have we've

1509
00:49:53,925 --> 00:49:56,445

1510
00:49:56,445 --> 00:49:58,965
dead and and we have this eyewitness

1511
00:49:58,965 --> 00:50:00,645
account of the mermaid the mermaid still

1512
00:50:00,645 --> 00:50:02,115
with she's here she's so alive

1513
00:50:02,685 --> 00:50:03,765
and she told us up to that

1514
00:50:03,765 --> 00:50:04,665
and we said a whole lot just

1515
00:50:04,665 --> 00:50:06,405
stop i know just stop right there

1516
00:50:06,495 --> 00:50:08,505

1517
00:50:08,505 --> 00:50:10,245
already i said i'm like yeah i

1518
00:50:10,245 --> 00:50:13,065
said obviously every every person who's dead

1519
00:50:13,065 --> 00:50:15,735
you can see the obvious clues here

1520
00:50:15,735 --> 00:50:18,645
there's the each person is holding a

1521
00:50:18,735 --> 00:50:21,855
a cracker for the crabs to yeah

1522
00:50:22,245 --> 00:50:22,437
and

1523
00:50:22,665 --> 00:50:24,495
open crabs they also all have their

1524
00:50:24,495 --> 00:50:26,655
phones on video and so i think

1525
00:50:26,655 --> 00:50:28,185
they all were they were all recording

1526
00:50:28,185 --> 00:50:31,115
something yeah so they were well with

1527
00:50:31,115 --> 00:50:32,715
this was a party to celebrate the

1528
00:50:32,715 --> 00:50:34,305
turtles being hatched you know how that

1529
00:50:34,305 --> 00:50:36,495
happens on the issue okay so yeah

1530
00:50:36,585 --> 00:50:37,965
the mermaid is gonna come out and

1531
00:50:37,986 --> 00:50:39,225
bring the turtles into or you know

1532
00:50:39,255 --> 00:50:41,445
help escort them into the water and

1533
00:50:41,445 --> 00:50:42,759
then all these people were

1534
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:45,870
and then mayhem ensues so yeah as

1535
00:50:45,870 --> 00:50:47,850
far as we know yeah it's now

1536
00:50:47,850 --> 00:50:49,620
the time to ask about pictures or

1537
00:50:49,650 --> 00:50:51,420
no because i'd love a selfie one

1538
00:50:51,420 --> 00:50:52,470
second okay

1539
00:50:53,615 --> 00:50:55,200
looks like what we've got here is

1540
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:58,860

at this party by the pixies because

1546
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:09,960
it looks like what we got here

1547
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:13,200
is a wave of mutilation

1548
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:19,830

thirty seconds into the song
