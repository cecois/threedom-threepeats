to be the same thing as well

69
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:41,280
to be quite clear when i wouldn't

70
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,300
have come you wouldn't have come i

71
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:44,160
don't want to watch that you don't

72
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,630
want to watch it not at this

73
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:47,340

78
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,440

when it feels like work yeah it's

80
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:59,880
because because you should be watching them

81
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,770
for fun for sure and i think

82
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:04,440

83
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:07,530
be done with the season only because

84
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:08,580

yeah doesn't do when you get off

253
00:09:12,452 --> 00:09:14,640
for less what i like about our

254
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,150
show is it's relaxed it's conversational we're

255
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:19,920
just shooting the breeze and we're three

256
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,481
people know each other meanwhile kevin like

257
00:09:21,481 --> 00:09:23,010
a sneak is trying to take pictures

258
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,960
and even like zeke there's there's a

259
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:28,080
shadow of a microphone stand over kevin's

260
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:29,340
face through the window and it looks

261
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:30,510
like he had a topknot and i

262
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:31,380
was like why did he put his

263
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:33,030
hair up and i was like oh

264
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:35,490
here we go grow enough hair for

265
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:36,990
this top guy oh my god i

266
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:38,280
was so surprised but so did you

267
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,350
think it was sexy though i do

268
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:42,750
think they think whether things are sexy

269
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:43,950
or not with people i'm working with

270
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:46,680
so anyone you're not working with you're

271
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,240
constantly judging if they're sexy

272
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,250
i do allow that tend to the

273
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:53,100
conversation yeah here's a question speaking of

274
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,170
something that i just reminded myself of

275
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:58,530

402
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:33,330
who the

403
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,700
people are not showing us although that

404
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,680
being said i'm i've been bingeing a

405
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,840
podcast called normal gosh oh yes yes

406
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:42,300
yes and it's very enjoyable it's literally

407
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:44,820
people call ah well the the woman

408
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:47,100
host has a guest and then it

409
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:49,440
hosted a host reads a story that

410
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,420
has been submitted that is you're sick

411
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:53,490
because gossip a gossip story

412
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,020
submitted by so you could literally write

413
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:57,360
in and tell the whole story then

414
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,650
she'll read out louder than the guest

415
00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:00,180
kind of like says what they should

416
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:01,800
do what she thinks what the guest

417
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,510
things they would do whatever and it's

418
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:04,710
very very fun it's a really good

419
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:06,270
listen and one thing i'm surprised by

420
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:07,170
is that a lot of times there's

421
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:09,780
no resolution because it's just a story

422
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:13,170
that secondhand more third-hand but you still

423
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:13,650
feel like

424
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,760
it was fun to listen to because

425
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,290

426
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:17,700

428
00:15:20,036 --> 00:15:22,110
as it goes along you're thinking what

429
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:23,250
would i do oh my god this

430
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:24,720

440
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:45,180
homework assignment oh here's the other thing

00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,930
this person's had some good news recently

450
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:06,660
did you do it in a salacious

451
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:06,900
voice

452
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:09,180
i've got to tell you some height

453
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:11,250

yeah but who cares right

459
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:24,480
i mean i didn't say you're this

460
00:16:24,502 --> 00:16:27,150
i do understand the appeal of that

461
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:28,980
because it's like every once in a

462
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:31,320
while i'll see that on instagram solomon

463
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,850
georgio would do it a lot because

464
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:34,920
hey i pass it also similar as

465
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,200
it's but the guest is sharing gossip

466
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,450
from their hometown yes oh yeah but

467
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:41,370
just seeing that like this there was

468
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:41,670
this

469
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:44,160
ah you know guy who worked at

470
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,047
my mom's bank who did whatever it's

471
00:16:46,047 --> 00:16:47,220
like it is kind of fun i

472
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:49,170
think so because yeah there's something very

473
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:51,530
funny about the normalcy of it it's

474
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:53,550
just it just kind of how relatable

475
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:55,620
at all is yes everyone has heard

476
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:57,390
a story like this life and yeah

477
00:16:57,741 --> 00:16:58,890
every once in a while someone that

478
00:16:58,890 --> 00:17:00,960
we know like there will be big

479
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:01,890
huge breaking

480
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:04,140
in like oh yeah when shattering that's

481
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:06,360
when it's fucking crazy young that's winning

482
00:17:06,592 --> 00:17:08,400
the kind that this person was asking

483
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,110

521
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:38,670

00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,280
want to like i'm close to this

524
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,840
person i just don't that was the

525
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,490
thing about words sometimes it seems like

526
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:45,810
like i've had people tell me things

527
00:18:45,810 --> 00:18:48,720
that are so personal yeah that it's

528
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,890
like i understand that

529
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:51,420
that in the context of this story

530
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:53,550
this person is bad or whatever but

531
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:55,530
it's like now you're telling me something

532
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:58,320
that is absolutely none of my business

533
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:00,540
yeah and i don't want to know

534
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:02,760
that's how i would feel about people's

535
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:07,110
dating situations to like if if two

536
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:09,596
people i know dated for awhile and

537
00:19:09,596 --> 00:19:10,050
was then

538
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,400
they would break up and one would

539
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,140
complain about yeah yeah it would be

540
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:15,330
like i you know i don't really

541
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:17,279
care i don't know because people break

542
00:19:17,279 --> 00:19:19,320
up people you know it has to

543
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:21,090
cross into a level of like oh

544
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:24,450
this person like majorly did a wrong

545
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:26,820
thing or yes something illegal or something

546
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:28,440
like that for me to like want

547
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,610
to hear that kind of stuff like

548
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:30,210
because it's true

549
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:31,290
ricky because it becomes kind of a

550
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:33,300
grey area where like so does that

551
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:34,410
mean i'm not supposed to be friends

552
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:35,910

oh yeah the show was actually back

1185
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:02,670
but look for twenty percent off a

1186
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:04,560

1187
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:06,721

1188
00:42:06,810 --> 00:42:09,780

1190
00:42:13,110 --> 00:42:13,890
door work

1191
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:16,920
but then the other the indoor property

1192
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:21,690
brothers the property ones ones outdoor ones

1193
00:42:21,690 --> 00:42:23,430
indoor i'll take your word i think

1194
00:42:23,430 --> 00:42:24,540
it was kept in a crate that

1195
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:26,340
everyone gets to run free no ones

1196
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:27,990
the ones the guy selling the house

1197
00:42:27,990 --> 00:42:30,780
one chance to vulnerable to coyote construction

1198
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:33,360
vs realty so indoor property brothers says

1199
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:35,070
it's how he

1200
00:42:35,070 --> 00:42:36,480
he follows it up and he goes

1201
00:42:37,290 --> 00:42:39,870
goes personal voice assistants have changed the

1202
00:42:39,870 --> 00:42:43,140
way we do whatever right any but

1203
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:45,090
but the implication is he's saying it's

1204
00:42:45,090 --> 00:42:46,830
a fact as well and that's not

1205
00:42:47,010 --> 00:42:49,530
that's not affect the yeah the tiny

1206
00:42:49,530 --> 00:42:51,330
amount of people use them we have

1207
00:42:51,330 --> 00:42:53,970
a personal voice assistant if you can

1208
00:42:53,970 --> 00:42:55,230
call it that right and

1209
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:56,519
the only thing we use it for

1210
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:57,420
is to turn the lights on and

1211
00:42:57,420 --> 00:42:59,310

and it's god of the elkins book

1241
00:44:02,370 --> 00:44:04,200
and they're all really easy recipes and

1242
00:44:04,230 --> 00:44:04,454
i

1243
00:44:04,590 --> 00:44:06,630

1248
00:44:14,730 --> 00:44:16,620
scott said his mom would buy the

1249
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:18,360
ingredients for the week planning me so

1250
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:20,220
i picked out three things i wanted

1251
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:21,660
to make and i or i ordered

1252
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:22,890
my groceries which i've been doing since

1253
00:44:22,890 --> 00:44:24,750
the pandemic anyway and i just put

1254
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:26,100
in all the ingredients which made it

1255
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:27,300
much easier because one of the things

1256
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:28,620
that hold me up from cooking is

1257
00:44:28,620 --> 00:44:29,760
that i don't know what other things

1258
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:31,230
are i'm like books tarragon yeah i

1259
00:44:31,230 --> 00:44:33,000
gotta google that at the grocery store

1260
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:34,560
look around i fear what it looks

1261
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:36,390
like right when i'm ordering groceries i

1262
00:44:36,390 --> 00:44:38,040
could just type it in and then

1263
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:39,330
there it is so that made it

1264
00:44:39,330 --> 00:44:41,430
a lot easier for me yeah and

1265
00:44:41,550 --> 00:44:43,890
i have found that i'm really um

1266
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:44,910
loving it and the

1267
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:46,320

having the baby i feel like ordering

1275
00:45:00,450 --> 00:45:01,500

1303
00:45:54,810 --> 00:45:56,340
the the picket the picture on the

1304
00:45:56,340 --> 00:45:57,900
cover was like a big bowl of

1305
00:45:57,900 --> 00:46:00,209
gummy bears and just a spoon and

1306
00:46:00,209 --> 00:46:03,030
somebody eating um so i know that

00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:13,650
mochi but then i felt that i

1313
00:46:13,650 --> 00:46:15,810
was confusing i was talking about i

1314
00:46:15,810 --> 00:46:17,460

1315
00:46:17,460 --> 00:46:18,930
having mochi and i actually love it

1316
00:46:18,930 --> 00:46:20,130
i never had it before when i

1317
00:46:20,130 --> 00:46:21,060
said that i didn't have a talk

1318
00:46:21,060 --> 00:46:22,650
with something else and i'd like it

1319
00:46:22,650 --> 00:46:24,930
a lot consider the nachos i was

1320
00:46:24,930 --> 00:46:27,210
thinking macho there you go yeah now

1321
00:46:27,210 --> 00:46:28,650
that actually sharing that right because i

1322
00:46:28,650 --> 00:46:29,460
couldn't figure it out and i was

1323
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:30,929
waiting i'm thinking of green tea you

1324
00:46:30,929 --> 00:46:32,430
shouldn't make it sound so similar anyway

1325
00:46:32,490 --> 00:46:33,930
chevron has a voicemail for us and

1326
00:46:33,930 --> 00:46:35,640
let's hear it none of that was

1327
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:37,680
an ad by the three i love

1328
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:39,690
you guys quick question are you a

1329
00:46:39,690 --> 00:46:42,600
question if you could have your own

1330
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:44,550
like disney world kind of theme park

1331
00:46:45,030 --> 00:46:46,440
what would it be what would the

1332
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:49,740
different worlds the whoa the different sections

1333
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:51,210
of the place vs what i mean

1334
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:51,810
whoa

1335
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:55,530
love love you it does i was

1336
00:46:55,530 --> 00:46:58,770
thinking about this regarding disneyland how crazy

1337
00:46:58,770 --> 00:47:01,290
that a guy's name guy's last name

1338
00:47:01,290 --> 00:47:03,810
is now synonymous with we we have

1339
00:47:03,810 --> 00:47:05,039
because i like i'm like laugh kiss

1340
00:47:05,039 --> 00:47:05,790
like if it just had a laugh

1341
00:47:05,790 --> 00:47:07,826
cause i absolutely fucked me here yeah

1342
00:47:08,010 --> 00:47:10,560
oh strange what would your world be

1343
00:47:11,850 --> 00:47:15,030
sex world i mean peep show i

1344
00:47:15,210 --> 00:47:16,680
me a haunted house again but i

1345
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:17,940
would become a column

1346
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:21,570
um i you know i don't know

1347
00:47:21,570 --> 00:47:23,010
i think disney world kinda nailed it

1348
00:47:23,730 --> 00:47:26,190
it's hard to think of something that

1349
00:47:26,190 --> 00:47:28,650
they haven't watched the new disney land

1350
00:47:28,650 --> 00:47:30,660
world be because they they've got the

1351
00:47:30,660 --> 00:47:31,410
future

1352
00:47:32,550 --> 00:47:33,780
then a lot of it is the

1353
00:47:33,780 --> 00:47:36,180
past like frontier land yeah star wars

1354
00:47:36,330 --> 00:47:39,429
the past so yeah the lounge the

1355
00:47:39,429 --> 00:47:41,520
best ancient oh so long ago yeah

1356
00:47:41,670 --> 00:47:43,020
yeah that's confusing to me but then

1357
00:47:43,020 --> 00:47:45,150
adventure land feels like the past because

1358
00:47:45,180 --> 00:47:46,710
no one's really having these types of

1359
00:47:46,740 --> 00:47:49,080
adventures anymore are they like jump happens

1360
00:47:49,110 --> 00:47:51,300
oh that's adventure land that's adventureland indiana

1361
00:47:51,390 --> 00:47:52,560
jones is the

1362
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:54,390
past yeah i'm like yeah we went

1363
00:47:54,390 --> 00:47:56,940
in the cars land right yeah and

1364
00:47:56,970 --> 00:47:58,800
the share was the funniest fucking picture

1365
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:01,106
my nephew looks so freaked out over

1366
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:02,220
because they take it over the last

1367
00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:04,770
big crazy yeah yeah our nephew we

1368
00:48:04,824 --> 00:48:07,020
were there for years or so ago

1369
00:48:07,020 --> 00:48:08,190
and he was a little like i

1370
00:48:08,190 --> 00:48:09,060
don't want to do that again but

1371
00:48:09,060 --> 00:48:10,770
i'm wondering how oh no hell on

1372
00:48:10,770 --> 00:48:12,240
it now yeah buddy i think the

1373
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:12,540
age

1374
00:48:12,750 --> 00:48:13,740
cause they had that too about a

1375
00:48:13,740 --> 00:48:15,030
few things they refused to go on

1376
00:48:15,030 --> 00:48:17,340
haunted mansion because they were they were

1377
00:48:17,820 --> 00:48:20,309
so three and six last time and

1378
00:48:20,309 --> 00:48:21,210
they were scared of it when we

1379
00:48:21,210 --> 00:48:22,645
went on but now they're six and

1380
00:48:22,645 --> 00:48:24,120
nine but i couldn't convince them never

1381
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:25,020
in my life am i going to

1382
00:48:25,020 --> 00:48:26,760
go on that ah my nephews are

1383
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:29,010
veterans of the gulf war oh

1384
00:48:30,390 --> 00:48:31,380
so they're scared of

1385
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:35,670
um but yeah so what i mean

1386
00:48:36,510 --> 00:48:37,950
because the future just takes care of

1387
00:48:37,980 --> 00:48:40,050
everything so what in the past could

1388
00:48:40,650 --> 00:48:42,690
like they're they're they're all there could

1389
00:48:42,690 --> 00:48:47,160
be like like pyramids and stuff oh

1390
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:48,630
no i don't think i really want

1391
00:48:48,630 --> 00:48:50,460
anything from the past i think i

1392
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:52,230
just want something completely fake like

1393
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:55,890
like really cute jello wowed all over

1419
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:55,020

00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:09,300
to it that's a yawn what i

1427
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:10,470
liked about it is you can go

00:50:10,470 --> 00:50:13,500
through a museum scavenger hunt land yeah

1429
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:15,150

of like a sort of cormac mccarthy's

1438
00:50:32,610 --> 00:50:35,490

1439
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:36,930

two people decide on an adverb without

1517
00:53:13,875 --> 00:53:15,855
the third knowing lot of these games

1518
00:53:15,855 --> 00:53:18,613
involves subterfuge yeah the third player asked

1519
00:53:18,613 --> 00:53:20,145
the others to do tasks in the

1520
00:53:20,145 --> 00:53:21,885
manner of the word it could also

1521
00:53:21,885 --> 00:53:22,665
be done as the scene

1522
00:53:23,355 --> 00:53:25,425

we actually know what adverbs armley and

1526
00:53:34,905 --> 00:53:36,225
the third player has three guesses to

1527
00:53:36,225 --> 00:53:38,745
guess the word normally would be horrible

1528
00:53:39,735 --> 00:53:40,245
okay

1529
00:53:41,475 --> 00:53:43,723
