8
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:29,670
a voicemail from you guys that you

9
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:32,460

10
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:38,100

to a voicemail and we're gonna talk

13
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:43,050
about it and these are real people

14
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:44,430
by the way these aren't actors that

15
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:47,160
are reenacting actual voicemails that people have

16
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,480

boys are doing that to us

22
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:01,140
yeah but there's a chance that we

23
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:02,870
will hire actors to read them because

24
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:04,020
we want to protect the identity of

25
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:06,240
somebody who sent it exactly then we

26
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,040

42
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:33,690
to your bank account and stuff but

43
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:35,130
i just wanna be clear isn't acting

44
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,560

45
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,180

acting to me fox is incredible as

53
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,760
ray you as an impersonation of ray

54
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,560
charles but if he was just talking

55
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,240
on a podcast as ray charles is

56
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:00,000
that acting or is it reacting to

57
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,500
to someone asking him to do it

58
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:03,480
and then doing thing that he wanted

59
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,950
to do when did doing the things

60
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:07,710

00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:10,560
the distortion was here we got a

96
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,420
ball i couldn't hear myself think hey

00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:14,550

98
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:16,020
time yo cousin i'm yum

99
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:17,760
i wanted to see if there was

100
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,490
anything in your career whether it's like

101
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:22,860
on a podcaster and stand up or

102
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:25,320
anything that you wish you could redo

103
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:26,970
and i know that that's not a

104
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:28,710
good way to look at things but

105
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:30,660
i'm curious have you ever been a

106
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:32,070
sketch where you're like oh we didn't

107
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:33,540
really get what else trying to do

108
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:35,730
there or like a story you wish

109
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:36,660
you could tell again but

110
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,380
differently without you know getting spanked fiskars

111
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:43,390
alright love you i love you back

112
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:45,300
very nice question this is a good

113
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:46,710
question it's making me think about all

114
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:50,580
my failures yeah it's so tough to

115
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:52,560
because i think about it a lot

116
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,720
about oh man if only i knew

117
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,850
this then or if only i

118
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,710
i'd worked harder if only i had

119
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:01,260
not pursued this particular thing it's it

120
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,720
it is semi fruitless and in a

121
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,450
certain way but yeah maybe if it

122
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:08,310
informs the choices you're making now it's

123
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:09,870
worthwhile i don't know i would say

124
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:12,540
like very broadly macro i wish i'd

125
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:14,904
never smoked yeah and i wish i'd

126
00:04:14,904 --> 00:04:15,930
go to therapy sooner

127
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:19,560
then like more thing like an actual

128
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:22,140
like a do over thing i wish

129
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:25,140
i had taped there was there was

130
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:27,420
a certain standard of our presence together

131
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,140
yeah together so this was one big

132
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:32,940
gift that would have been so good

133
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,430
i quit your gret i wish i'd

134
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:37,200
recorded i have an hour

135
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,490
austin of called you should have told

136
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:40,200
me that i wish i had done

137
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:42,660
later because i recorded it and then

138
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:44,220
i went on tour with it before

139
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:46,800
the recording came out yeah yeah yeah

140
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,180
and it's like i'm not i'm not

141
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:49,740
ashamed of it's recording tomorrow

142
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:54,480
and it will say like it'll i

143
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,070
mean it's what's the difference between that

144
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:57,750
and remastering albums you know what i

145
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,640
mean well because i can't remember the

146
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:03,420
song attitude well that's a problem yeah

147
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:04,200
then why should we

148
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:07,500
yeah i wish i never said this

149
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:10,170
i think so many things you can't

150
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:12,060
do you can't feel that way about

151
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:13,980
because that was your capability at the

152
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,950
time exactly as the thing your parents

153
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:18,660
you have to forgive them because that's

154
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:19,710
the best they could do at the

155
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:21,570
thai right i just i was just

156
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:24,060
listening to a podcast where this sort

157
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,440
of same thing was bro

158
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,730
caught up just sort of the idea

159
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,710
oh i wish i had known this

160
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:30,570
when i was eighteen we know and

161
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:31,470
why did i act this way when

162
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:33,150
i was nineteen nobel and that it

163
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:34,290
was a therapist was talking to this

164
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:35,430
person on the podcast and it was

165
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:36,930
about and she was saying

166
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:39,330
you know if you go back and

167
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:41,130
read like you're like a journal or

168
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:42,450
like an email from when you were

169
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:46,797
nineteen you would be like shocked by

170
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,990
oh damn you are basically like that

171
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,070
yeah she was just saying like she

172
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:51,000
was looking back at her old stuff

173
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:51,600
and she was like oh my god

174
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,220
i can't believe how much i didn't

175
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,750
know if you are just a kid

176
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,100
whatever not saying that's true about all

177
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,900
these things we're talking about but i

178
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:58,260
mean it

179
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,670
applies because i think it's just like

180
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:02,820
letting yourself give yourself grace for what

181
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:05,400
didn't go exactly right or using your

182
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,050
life or career whatever just things you

183
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:08,370
didn't achieve do as well as you

184
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:10,110
could have now but it's like you

185
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:11,940

190
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:22,230
very angry with my with my past

191
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:23,820
self yeah yeah yeah and it's like

192
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:24,750
i think about that a lot yeah

193
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:26,130
like why didn't i work harder why

194
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,540
didn't i know how to do this

195
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:28,590
thing that i now know how to

196
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:29,940
do if only i'd known how to

197
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:31,260
do it back then and then yeah

198
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:33,450
career would be different and i that

199
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:35,010
always makes me think of a story

200
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:37,200
that a friend of mine told about

201
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,640
being in therapy

202
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:42,780
he and the therapist saying to her

203
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:45,630
and if if you could if you

204
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:47,790
could talk to little amy what would

205
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:49,710
you say to her and her name

206
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:50,580
was not amy right

207
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,710
just don't touch lamy

208
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,883
choose point if you've just talked to

209
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:56,670
little amy

210
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:59,130
what would you say to her and

211
00:06:59,130 --> 00:06:59,880
my friend said

212
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,460
thanks a fucking lot

213
00:07:05,610 --> 00:07:06,150
i mean yeah

214
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,930
i definitely um i definitely have things

215
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:11,070
that i would look back i mean

216
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:12,450
because the question was about career which

217
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:13,830
is is lot but it's hard not

218
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:15,840
to apply to everything else but i

219
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:16,950
just look back and i'm like oh

220
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:18,150
that was a waste of time or

221
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:19,680
one night get those waste of time

222
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,000
or whatever it's like because you don't

223
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:24,210
know yeah anything exactly till you know

224
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:25,230
and then you experience the thing i'm

225
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:26,520
going to go oh that's how that

226
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,360
should have been yeah

227
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,890
a or i could have done that

228
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,644
job better if i had known this

229
00:07:30,644 --> 00:07:30,990
sort of

230
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,980
brutal yeah yeah connection cause once you

231
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:36,300
see the answer you're like ah why

232
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:37,260
didn't i put that from the start

233
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:40,052
why didn't i just guess why didn't

234
00:07:40,052 --> 00:07:43,140
know i guess those age rewind i

235
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:44,550
just start with rage

236
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:48,360
so it's a waste of time but

237
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,880
unfortunately we all can't help but think

238
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,436
of it all day every day

239
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,310
yeah we can only be consumed by

240
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:57,420
it every waking moment

241
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:02,520
yeah but um but you know then

242
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,230
again if if things had gone differently

243
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:06,150
i feel like i've lucked into some

244
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,460
many things in my life yeah and

245
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:09,930
it's true i always come back to

246
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:11,640
that though the timing of everything else

247
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,470
is basically everything else that happened like

248
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,570
yeah everything happens for a reason quote

249
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:17,100
unquote you can be sort of like

250
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:18,240
oh man

251
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:20,100
okay we were trying to have that

252
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,600
baby for ten years like

253
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,890
what if like what if my body

254
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:28,020
was ten years younger i was doing

255
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:28,950
the go on

256
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:31,080
it looked like the

257
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:34,170
oh but you know like it's so

258
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:36,020
difficult right you're like oh if we

259
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:37,263
just say this thing

260
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:40,317
if i but then but then it

261
00:08:40,317 --> 00:08:42,210
wouldn't be i mean person wouldn't exist

262
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:43,920
yeah i always yeah back about that

263
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,630
of like if you went back and

264
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:47,730
relive your life the people in it

265
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,130
there's there's no way i ever would

266
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:53,070
have met cool up without all the

267
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:54,870
things happening exactly the way they have

268
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:56,430
because we just weren't not in the

269
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:57,960
same circles i would not have met

270
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:58,290
janie

271
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,550

277
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:15,660
remember loaf of bread but also welcome

278
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:17,610
to stick a butter clipped was a

279
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:19,050
pilot that got picked up and it

280
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:20,910
was a year until we shot the

281
00:09:21,637 --> 00:09:24,240
scene and so we all became friends

282
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,760
over this year wow why why was

283
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,500
that i don't remember it was something

284
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,330
like that's very strange i know i

285
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:31,200
let because i

286
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:32,640
just i have to look back at

287
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,990
this and see what the reason yeah

288
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:35,190
please yeah i'm gonna check in your

289
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:36,960
files i don't know why it was

290
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,766
but anyways yeah but it was like

291
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,860
timing you know so if there's good

292
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:42,300
in your life be thankful that the

293
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:44,070
good is there because it unless you

294
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:45,660
did the exact things that you did

295
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,190
it never would have happened

296
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:50,700
ah you gotta make mistakes yeah you

297
00:09:50,702 --> 00:09:52,350
simply got to yeah and like with

298
00:09:52,371 --> 00:09:53,730
acting and stuff it's like a few

299
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:54,870
if i look back and i'm like

300
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,460
oh that's not that great when you

301
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:57,360
look back and you're like oh i

302
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,350
wish i had done that better but

303
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:00,900
it's like but you literally like you

304
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,640
can't even control which version they take

305
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:04,080
of what you shot so like maybe

306
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,040
you did do it but i mean

307
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,230
you know it's just the whole i

308
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:08,400
had an acting job

309
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:11,850
ah last week and i felt like

310
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:14,550
for the first time and i feel

311
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:15,630
like a long time i felt like

312
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:17,310
i did a good job but like

313
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:18,900
in the moment and i was like

314
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:20,280
man i didn't like that that much

315
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:21,480
and then we did a few more

316
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,310
takes and everything and i felt like

317
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:26,130
that's okay and then you know ah

318
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:28,740
the director like eventually

319
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:31,350
we finished the scene and i was

320
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:33,270
like if they're fine with it then

321
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:34,680
i'm fine with it you know i

322
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,030
mean like right you used to go

323
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:37,650

00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:03,540
yeah yeah yeah

371
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,460
that's so hard though because it's like

372
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:06,660
it sounds like he didn't really know

373
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,610
what he wanted from me it was

374
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:09,750
not him but i think it's hard

375
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:11,370
as a director i went through that

376
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:13,380
the first season of my show where

377
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:16,350
the director just had the way of

378
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:18,720
talking where it was like it felt

379
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,070
like you were doing something wrong every

380
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:21,480
time anytime you gave a note and

381
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,730
then eventually i was like i left

382
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:24,330
that first season

383
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,860
going like i don't think i'm funny

384
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:27,600
at all and then and then we

385
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,190
had a discussion between seasons he was

386
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:30,120
like confirmed

387
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:32,760
you're not funny but it was like

388
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:33,810
no that was just the way he

389
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:35,820
was giving notes of like he's trying

390
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,590
to perfect it after the first take

391
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:38,820
and i'm like well this is comedy

392
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:40,260
let us like just kind of try

393
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,970
some stuff well some directors really can't

394
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,340
talk to actors yeah this is very

395
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:46,830
strange yeah something that i like had

396
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:48,720
to because early plays that i directed

397
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,890
