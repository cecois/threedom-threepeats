54
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:08,760
talk about every single episode every movie

55
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:11,281
in the new iterations and i wanna

56
00:02:11,281 --> 00:02:13,470
save a more dreary thing to do

57
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:15,420
when i was evil when i was

58
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:17,250

sir

61
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:20,580
when they had dairyland choosing

62
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:23,430
everyone had a crush on darla and

63
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:25,950
she used her powers to manipulate them

64
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,740
this is why representation matters because laura

65
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:31,020
likes darla that's right there's something fucked

66
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:34,260
up though about this being a five-year-old

67
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,510
that everyone thinks is the best cutie

68
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:38,370
little cutie pie like that must be

69
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:41,310

strange presents golden opportunities here are ten

191
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,570
mind hacks to use with gen x

192
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,160
o mind hacks

193
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:08,400
like hacking into our minds to control

194
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,020
them is out yeah what he said

195
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:12,840
yeah dumb don't mind hack me bro

196
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,480
before we start i'll be generalizing not

197
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,790
every genetics will think this way especially

198
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:21,030
yes especially those gen xers born in

199
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:23,520
hc either born closer and aged either

200
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,410
boomers born nineteen forty six to sixty

201
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:27,480
four millennials weren't nineteen eighty one ninety

202
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,220
six but these tricks will work with

203
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:33,600
most lets go these trips bring gender

204
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,620
ex hates what you do when you

205
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,120
do this but there's no law against

206
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:39,270
one trick one motivate gen x with

207
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:41,520
two phrases do it your way and

208
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,530
don't sweat the rules many checks grew

209
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:45,450
up in divorce single home parent homes

210
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:47,040
so they were forced to be self-reliant

211
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,170
and unsupervised early on they want independence

212
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:50,760
to get it done their way you

213
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,500
don't relate to that one no never

214
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,700
heard the story about people

215
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:57,210
right now yeah ok next one send

216
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:59,610
your genetics colleagues well written emails gen

217
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:01,140
x grew up with email but before

218
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:03,480
ss or apps their teacher stressed correct

219
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:06,240
writing too poor grammar drives jacks nuts

220
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:06,990
no

221
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:10,110

222
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:13,140
weirdest emails also we've gotten like i

223
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:15,510
understand that one but we've gotten so

224
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:18,150
used to that kind of communication that

225
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:19,800

at all times they grew up when

no i like it when the email

268
00:09:54,931 --> 00:09:56,302
sits for a bit because if the

it's an ongoing conversation first of all

276
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:11,130
i will be so slow team either

277
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:13,560

love that it's the mind hack number

292
00:10:43,415 --> 00:10:46,535
four focus with gen x admission and

293
00:10:46,535 --> 00:10:49,265
results not seniority effort or hours worked

294
00:10:49,295 --> 00:10:50,885
you'll often hear jack say if someone

295
00:10:50,885 --> 00:10:51,965
gets the job done in half the

296
00:10:51,965 --> 00:10:54,275
time that's fine what i do say

297
00:10:54,275 --> 00:10:54,845
that a lot

298
00:10:56,825 --> 00:10:58,475
remember when we were just saying the

299
00:10:58,475 --> 00:10:59,885
other day paul i was like hey

303
00:11:03,815 --> 00:11:04,655
words right out of my mouth i

304
00:11:04,655 --> 00:11:07,415
was about why would someone not want

305
00:11:07,475 --> 00:11:09,515
that i don't because they want argue

306
00:11:09,515 --> 00:11:10,565
about seniority

307
00:11:12,155 --> 00:11:15,035
okay fine see now this this to

308
00:11:15,035 --> 00:11:18,605
me raises questions about other generations that

309
00:11:18,605 --> 00:11:19,925
i guess i didn't i wasn't aware

310
00:11:19,925 --> 00:11:21,695
of that there's what some generation it's

311
00:11:21,845 --> 00:11:23,945
way into arguing about seniority well like

312
00:11:23,945 --> 00:11:25,595
boomers might want you to work all

313
00:11:25,595 --> 00:11:27,035
the hours to get the thing done

314
00:11:27,102 --> 00:11:29,495
whoa are we giving boomers these genetics

315
00:11:29,495 --> 00:11:31,895
mind hacks oh no no no

316
00:11:31,925 --> 00:11:34,625
we can't get bluffing huh the micro

317
00:11:34,865 --> 00:11:37,025
boomers and to them melendez no no

318
00:11:37,025 --> 00:11:38,885

listening boomers turn off this show if

320
00:11:41,315 --> 00:11:42,965
there's any boomers listening to this and

321
00:11:42,965 --> 00:11:44,525
we've we've done a poll of our

322
00:11:44,555 --> 00:11:47,255
oldest audience members youtube better turn this

323
00:11:47,255 --> 00:11:48,545
off right now we've done a good

324
00:11:48,545 --> 00:11:50,375
job of pruning the boomers from the

325
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:51,425
show got pretty the boom

326
00:11:52,235 --> 00:11:54,395
okay mine tag number five allowed x

327
00:11:54,395 --> 00:11:56,525
a balanced life jack scrub with workaholic

328
00:11:56,525 --> 00:11:58,715
boomer parents seeing that gen x things

329
00:11:58,715 --> 00:11:59,735
work is part of life but not

330
00:11:59,735 --> 00:12:02,345
why why they live so what okay

331
00:12:03,635 --> 00:12:05,195
well my generation doesn't want to work

332
00:12:05,195 --> 00:12:07,175
as the you know is what kim

333
00:12:07,175 --> 00:12:10,655
cardassian woodson exactly she works hard she

334
00:12:10,655 --> 00:12:11,555
works so hard

335
00:12:12,402 --> 00:12:13,805
how is it a mind hack like

336
00:12:13,865 --> 00:12:16,175
allow them to have a balanced life

337
00:12:16,445 --> 00:12:18,754
who are you in this scenario yeah

338
00:12:19,475 --> 00:12:20,555
this is a tip for me so

339
00:12:20,555 --> 00:12:21,575
what i'm gonna do with this is

340
00:12:21,575 --> 00:12:23,345
go i shouldn't always talk to them

341
00:12:23,345 --> 00:12:24,725
about work i should i should talk

342
00:12:24,725 --> 00:12:26,285
to them about what are you talking

343
00:12:26,285 --> 00:12:29,225
about us ah

344
00:12:30,815 --> 00:12:32,825
i also i also think that these

345
00:12:32,825 --> 00:12:35,015
mind hacks should be for gen z

346
00:12:35,075 --> 00:12:38,675
only okay well here because they're they're

347
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:41,195
more simpatico with us mind hag members

348
00:12:41,195 --> 00:12:43,385
six bond with gen x as individuals

349
00:12:43,625 --> 00:12:45,515
not as part of a tribe millennials

350
00:12:45,545 --> 00:12:48,545
or institution boomers institutions from government to

351
00:12:48,545 --> 00:12:50,514
marriage showed they couldn't be trusted during

352
00:12:50,615 --> 00:12:54,635
gen x's youth even though you trust

353
00:12:54,635 --> 00:12:55,745
them you're gonna kill me

354
00:12:58,085 --> 00:13:00,785
you gotta understand that they don't find

355
00:13:00,785 --> 00:13:02,705
there's too many here i'll skip to

356
00:13:02,705 --> 00:13:05,555
the twentieth too long didn't read ah

357
00:13:05,615 --> 00:13:07,835
number seven be direct number eight acknowledged

358
00:13:07,835 --> 00:13:08,555
they exist

359
00:13:10,595 --> 00:13:13,325
expect pessimism and number ten expect to

360
00:13:13,325 --> 00:13:16,325
work life separation you know i learn

361
00:13:16,445 --> 00:13:18,215
i first of all i think you

362
00:13:18,215 --> 00:13:19,925

00:13:19,925 --> 00:13:22,355
i that's much appreciated i try hello

364
00:13:22,355 --> 00:13:24,365
we might be segments of your imagination

365
00:13:24,875 --> 00:13:26,915
yes other people might not i don't

366
00:13:26,915 --> 00:13:28,415
know i'm more i've been worried about

367
00:13:28,415 --> 00:13:29,735
that but i think you're

368
00:13:29,736 --> 00:13:31,865
real or what if you found out

369
00:13:31,865 --> 00:13:32,825
that that show we did the other

370
00:13:32,825 --> 00:13:34,265
night you were the only person on

371
00:13:34,265 --> 00:13:36,155
stage i would honestly believe that it

372
00:13:36,155 --> 00:13:37,655
was one of the most surreal experiences

373
00:13:37,655 --> 00:13:40,715
of my life but it was in

374
00:13:40,715 --> 00:13:42,455
retrospect or you know in watching it

375
00:13:42,455 --> 00:13:44,735
i felt like it was um really

376
00:13:44,735 --> 00:13:46,806
fun yeah not that it wasn't retro

377
00:13:46,806 --> 00:13:49,085
nomadic was fun no i mean i'm

378
00:13:49,085 --> 00:13:49,625
saying

379
00:13:50,255 --> 00:13:52,205
once in a moment it was very

380
00:13:52,265 --> 00:13:53,975
odd we should describe what we did

381
00:13:53,975 --> 00:13:56,585
we performed um at dynasty typewriter theater

382
00:13:56,585 --> 00:14:00,035
with no audience again but we had

383
00:14:00,035 --> 00:14:02,465
the cameras roving around the theater following

384
00:14:02,465 --> 00:14:04,715
us to different locations we did all

385
00:14:04,715 --> 00:14:06,755
the scenes were just super weird because

386
00:14:06,755 --> 00:14:08,045
we were like in these we were

387
00:14:08,075 --> 00:14:09,515
it was just a different it was

388
00:14:09,673 --> 00:14:10,055
just differ

389
00:14:10,445 --> 00:14:12,035
it was just different and i really

390
00:14:12,035 --> 00:14:13,565
liked it it had a ground breakers

391
00:14:13,925 --> 00:14:15,605
yeah little yellow and different and what

392
00:14:15,605 --> 00:14:17,825
we do is we shake up the

393
00:14:17,825 --> 00:14:20,855
systems and we break the paradigms which

394
00:14:20,915 --> 00:14:23,045
is very gen x and it's very

395
00:14:23,105 --> 00:14:25,205
real yeah well it's a combo of

396
00:14:25,205 --> 00:14:27,245
the two generations yeah the normal places

397
00:14:27,245 --> 00:14:28,265
are not to be trusted so i'm

398
00:14:28,265 --> 00:14:30,035
glad you didn't perform there that's what

399
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:30,215
i had

400
00:14:30,245 --> 00:14:31,985
to tell lauren i was fired because

401
00:14:32,015 --> 00:14:33,365

402
00:14:33,365 --> 00:14:34,625
show with you but i also consider

403
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:35,645
it like but it's kind of perfect

expression is hey don't have a baby

00:16:21,245 --> 00:16:24,095

464
00:16:31,025 --> 00:16:32,405
that's what we were hoping with you

465
00:16:32,465 --> 00:16:33,545
lauren is that you wouldn't have a

466
00:16:33,545 --> 00:16:35,435
whole baby about this so well i

467
00:16:35,435 --> 00:16:37,505
couldn't help it or do you know

468
00:16:37,625 --> 00:16:38,915
lauren and i hope i hope this

469
00:16:38,915 --> 00:16:39,935
isn't weird to say but i was

470
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:41,375
hoping you would give birth to like

471
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:42,515
a lamb baby like in the movie

472
00:16:42,515 --> 00:16:44,285
lamb look there's a chance that could

473
00:16:44,285 --> 00:16:46,145
happen there's i think one of the

474
00:16:46,205 --> 00:16:48,665
weirdest parts about being pregnant is that

475
00:16:48,785 --> 00:16:50,375
you cannot fathom

476
00:16:50,405 --> 00:16:52,235
that there is an actual baby that

477
00:16:52,265 --> 00:16:54,245
well it's because like it's there should

478
00:16:54,245 --> 00:16:56,225
be like little windows on the stomach

479
00:16:56,435 --> 00:16:58,625
yeah and they think willows will evolve

480
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:00,215
and we'll get there where the stomach

481
00:17:00,215 --> 00:17:01,445
is clear so we could like look

482
00:17:01,445 --> 00:17:02,915

483
00:17:02,915 --> 00:17:04,625

557
00:19:41,676 --> 00:19:43,475
a one who'd just got married is

558
00:19:43,475 --> 00:19:45,395
about to have backs and has to

559
00:19:45,395 --> 00:19:46,685
have oral sex for the first time

560
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:48,005
as to imagine the penis as a

561
00:19:48,005 --> 00:19:49,955
little tiny version of the of the

562
00:19:49,955 --> 00:19:52,055
man that's the worst advice

563
00:19:52,055 --> 00:19:53,615
nice that's like in my well know

564
00:19:53,615 --> 00:19:55,835
and said they don't be loud we'll

565
00:19:55,837 --> 00:19:58,145
know it's gonna be gross and that

566
00:19:58,295 --> 00:20:00,875
you know snag hundred taxes they're sucking

567
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:02,165
your husband's whole body

568
00:20:03,935 --> 00:20:06,725
imagine you're a giant test and you

569
00:20:06,725 --> 00:20:08,495

570
00:20:08,885 --> 00:20:10,625

em out that's so sad it's really

572
00:20:13,055 --> 00:20:15,215

574
00:20:16,955 --> 00:20:18,905

576
00:20:21,635 --> 00:20:23,255

glasses absolutely so i ordered it and

625
00:21:59,945 --> 00:22:00,125
it took

626
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,745
a long time and then one day

627
00:22:03,125 --> 00:22:04,475
i got a package in the mail

628
00:22:05,285 --> 00:22:09,485
and it was a very tiny white

629
00:22:10,055 --> 00:22:11,821
plastic i ripped open and it wasn't

630
00:22:11,821 --> 00:22:13,535

00:22:15,455 --> 00:22:18,245
so small it was nothing to do

633
00:22:18,245 --> 00:22:19,745
with the images that they oh my

634
00:22:19,775 --> 00:22:21,125
but did what did they just find

635
00:22:21,125 --> 00:22:22,565
the tiniest human and put

636
00:22:23,735 --> 00:22:25,685
yeah so yeah picture i mean it

637
00:22:25,685 --> 00:22:26,915

638
00:22:26,915 --> 00:22:28,085
pretty upset but was also kind of

639
00:22:28,085 --> 00:22:28,715
hilarious

640
00:22:29,495 --> 00:22:31,145
did you get money back from it

641
00:22:31,145 --> 00:22:32,195
or were you just know i got

642
00:22:32,195 --> 00:22:33,725
like twenty bucks and it was like

643
00:22:33,875 --> 00:22:35,735
it came from very far away and

644
00:22:35,735 --> 00:22:36,605
i was there's just no way i'm

645
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:38,635
ever gonna track down this situation so

646
00:22:38,645 --> 00:22:40,655
i just i just ate it i

647
00:22:40,655 --> 00:22:42,455
wonder how many other people did this

648
00:22:42,515 --> 00:22:43,955
i'm sure so many people it was

649
00:22:43,955 --> 00:22:46,205
so funny when i was just you

650
00:22:46,205 --> 00:22:48,305
and they're like we got wyoming burn

651
00:22:48,305 --> 00:22:49,265
the factory down

652
00:22:50,555 --> 00:22:52,085
this trunk when an accident they sent

653
00:22:52,085 --> 00:22:52,355
it to me

654
00:22:54,755 --> 00:22:56,405
well thank you buyer beware i'm glad

655
00:22:56,405 --> 00:22:58,295
i know not to bore you but

656
00:22:58,295 --> 00:22:59,885
then i've seen them on different sites

657
00:22:59,885 --> 00:23:02,705
and they're like real yeah so it

658
00:23:02,705 --> 00:23:04,175
was like somebody just use maybe you

659
00:23:04,175 --> 00:23:05,795
just something your dad maybe you didn't

660
00:23:05,795 --> 00:23:06,995
order the right one you should order

661
00:23:07,025 --> 00:23:08,555
another one i should order it again

662
00:23:08,585 --> 00:23:09,695
to see what happens

663
00:23:11,495 --> 00:23:12,665
one thing that's really funny is like

664
00:23:12,665 --> 00:23:16,145
stephanie allen um always messes up the

665
00:23:16,145 --> 00:23:17,462
size of things that she's ordering so

666
00:23:17,462 --> 00:23:20,255
they're either huge or really small and

667
00:23:20,345 --> 00:23:22,055
it's just very funny show like get

668
00:23:22,055 --> 00:23:22,955
an order in the mail and it's

669
00:23:22,955 --> 00:23:24,245
like ten times bigger than what she

670
00:23:24,245 --> 00:23:26,465
thought it was very small anyway that's

671
00:23:26,668 --> 00:23:28,805
there there are many i love stories

672
00:23:28,805 --> 00:23:30,095
like that when you see people post

673
00:23:30,095 --> 00:23:31,025
them that they

674
00:23:31,115 --> 00:23:33,815
accidentally ordered doll furniture whatever yeah i

675
00:23:33,845 --> 00:23:35,165
can't believe this office chair such a

676
00:23:35,165 --> 00:23:35,945
good deal

677
00:23:37,355 --> 00:23:38,345
and they will take a picture of

678
00:23:38,345 --> 00:23:39,425
it in the space like

679
00:23:41,705 --> 00:23:43,565
it's so good the best one was

680
00:23:43,565 --> 00:23:45,605

684
00:23:50,255 --> 00:23:51,485
of astroturf onto

685
00:23:53,435 --> 00:23:55,325
ms garbage oh my god this is

686
00:23:55,325 --> 00:23:57,796
why we don't trust institutions lauren yeah

687
00:23:57,815 --> 00:23:59,883

689
00:24:02,015 --> 00:24:05,285
columbia records and tape club and now

690
00:24:05,285 --> 00:24:07,115
i dig i didn't use that oh

691
00:24:07,145 --> 00:24:09,995
did you really just stay round campy

692
00:24:10,205 --> 00:24:11,285
know we ordered from that when we

693
00:24:11,285 --> 00:24:12,845
were kids and i don't know who

694
00:24:12,845 --> 00:24:14,225
whoever i don't i think it was

695
00:24:14,225 --> 00:24:15,275
a penny i don't think anyone ever

696
00:24:15,275 --> 00:24:16,565
paid like it was like we got

697
00:24:16,715 --> 00:24:17,915
unless we like put my parents' credit

698
00:24:17,915 --> 00:24:19,385
card and we're know you never had

699
00:24:19,385 --> 00:24:20,675
to put a credit card in right

700
00:24:20,675 --> 00:24:22,265
so how did that they would just

701
00:24:22,265 --> 00:24:23,735
they would send you bills through the

702
00:24:23,735 --> 00:24:24,757
mail it was like they would and

703
00:24:24,757 --> 00:24:26,435
then you just never paid them yeah

704
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:28,235
and but i i feel like they

705
00:24:28,235 --> 00:24:30,695
would go through collection agencies or somehow

706
00:24:30,695 --> 00:24:32,405
you know but like using your address

707
00:24:32,705 --> 00:24:33,005
i should

708
00:24:33,035 --> 00:24:34,355
asked my parents they remember because i

709
00:24:34,355 --> 00:24:35,645

these dogs out

1062
00:37:26,865 --> 00:37:28,275

1063
00:37:28,275 --> 00:37:30,345
really upset with us those guys were

1064
00:37:30,375 --> 00:37:31,545
huge

1065
00:37:32,775 --> 00:37:34,365
but um i remember one time we

1066
00:37:34,365 --> 00:37:36,735
watched a television show it was maybe

1067
00:37:36,735 --> 00:37:38,235
like the dog whisper or something like

1068
00:37:38,235 --> 00:37:40,245
that where like one of these houses

1069
00:37:40,245 --> 00:37:43,095
like hey you know instead of constantly

1070
00:37:43,095 --> 00:37:45,435
bending over and using your your hands

1071
00:37:45,435 --> 00:37:47,235
to like correct your dog or whatever

1072
00:37:47,235 --> 00:37:48,495
you can just use your feet and

1073
00:37:48,495 --> 00:37:50,895
tap tap the dog with your feet

1074
00:37:50,895 --> 00:37:52,815
and like like if if he's going

1075
00:37:52,935 --> 00:37:54,225
trying to go forward just stick your

1076
00:37:54,225 --> 00:37:55,545
foot out and block him and stuff

1077
00:37:55,545 --> 00:37:57,135
like that and so we were trying

1078
00:37:57,135 --> 00:37:59,745
that one day and this couple like

1079
00:37:59,895 --> 00:38:01,395
pulls over to the side of the

1080
00:38:01,395 --> 00:38:02,895
road and shouts out their window and

1081
00:38:02,895 --> 00:38:06,255
goes you shouldn't kick your dog oh

1082
00:38:06,255 --> 00:38:09,465
my god and then squeals away and

1083
00:38:09,465 --> 00:38:10,515
all you can think of to say

1084
00:38:10,515 --> 00:38:11,805
in the in a situation like that

1085
00:38:11,805 --> 00:38:13,065
is fuck yeah

1086
00:38:13,065 --> 00:38:15,321
yeah yeah yeah exactly but then you

1087
00:38:15,321 --> 00:38:16,665
look like someone who kicks their dog

1088
00:38:17,085 --> 00:38:19,935
yeah and screams fuck you passing motorists

1089
00:38:20,265 --> 00:38:21,975

1095
00:38:36,825 --> 00:38:38,445

school was when we were really on

1222
00:43:03,645 --> 00:43:06,915
aol yeah but i don't recall trying

1223
00:43:06,915 --> 00:43:08,055
to look up things like that but

1224
00:43:08,055 --> 00:43:09,705
i do recall being in chat rooms

1225
00:43:09,705 --> 00:43:12,465
where you would have conversations like that

1226
00:43:12,465 --> 00:43:13,905
with people and that was always very

1227
00:43:13,905 --> 00:43:15,825
exciting having a sleepover party and then

1228
00:43:15,825 --> 00:43:18,345
you basically go online like um just

1229
00:43:18,495 --> 00:43:19,425

you know presumably most people were like

1233
00:43:26,805 --> 00:43:28,575

1234
00:43:28,635 --> 00:43:30,705
gross reality that other people were not

1235
00:43:30,855 --> 00:43:32,475
yeah yeah that's it is funny though

1236
00:43:32,475 --> 00:43:34,305
to think of like little kids all

1237
00:43:34,305 --> 00:43:36,075
doing that to each other yeah it's

1238
00:43:36,075 --> 00:43:38,835

long time like people yeah there were

1269
00:44:41,025 --> 00:44:41,985
a couple of people that's

1270
00:44:42,015 --> 00:44:43,095
really funny i don't think about it

1271
00:44:43,095 --> 00:44:44,355
much they were comfortable that i did

1272

and didn't ever know who they were

1273
00:44:46,845 --> 00:44:47,955
but it's like someone that i met

1274
00:44:47,955 --> 00:44:49,125
in a chat room or something and

1275
00:44:49,125 --> 00:44:51,585
then we talk all the time um

1276
00:44:51,645 --> 00:44:53,055
and then it's just like you feel

1277
00:44:53,055 --> 00:44:54,765
like you get to know them pretty

1278
00:44:54,765 --> 00:44:57,525
well um and then there were certain

1279
00:44:57,525 --> 00:44:58,965
people from school where you wouldn't only

1280
00:44:58,969 --> 00:45:00,285
talk in person but you would talk

1281
00:45:00,285 --> 00:45:01,875

00:45:04,935 --> 00:45:06,614
like either you were too nervous or

1285
00:45:06,614 --> 00:45:08,295
there was like weird chemistry or like

1286
00:45:08,295 --> 00:45:09,375

each other because oh fuck i love

1456
00:51:14,690 --> 00:51:17,300
these one of us is a parent

1457
00:51:17,930 --> 00:51:19,730
who is short on cash and can

1458
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:23,090
only give one of their two children

1459
00:51:23,090 --> 00:51:25,670
their allowance this month the other two

1460
00:51:25,670 --> 00:51:26,930
are going to try to convince the

1461
00:51:26,930 --> 00:51:29,240
parent to give them the money

1462
00:51:29,313 --> 00:51:31,310
by explaining what they plan to spend

1463
00:51:31,310 --> 00:51:34,130
their allowance on however what they want

1464
00:51:34,130 --> 00:51:35,840
to purchase will be decided by the

1465
00:51:35,870 --> 00:51:38,300

you have to assign each other a

1491
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:32,450
a stupid thing but then you each

1492
00:52:32,450 --> 00:52:35,270

1493
00:52:35,270 --> 00:52:38,840
this thing and i'll decide who ah

1494
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:40,880
who i give the money to based

1495
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:41,000
on

1496
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,250
on the merits of your argument i

1497

1581
00:55:59,420 --> 00:56:02,120
good value as one year for one

1582
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:02,660
month

1583
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:04,760

mouse company not a pretzel company they

you do is that they would make

1623
00:57:34,580 --> 00:57:35,990
it so that the classes were all

1624
00:57:35,990 --> 00:57:38,690
one minute long day and the school

1625
00:57:38,690 --> 00:57:42,110
day would be over by eight thirty

1626
