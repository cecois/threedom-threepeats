search stress me out when you know

198

it's because it's like that the whole

199
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:21,420
thing is that you have to feel

200
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:23,010
you know it yeah before you go

201
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:24,840
in exactly yeah and a lot of

202
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,700
times i know it as i'm sitting

203
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:27,330
in i give my

204
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,740
self like thirty minutes in the car

205
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,970
when i arrive at the base and

206
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:31,410
i will just read it a million

207
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:32,790
times so yeah like i really know

208
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:34,890
what it is but it's much better

209
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:35,940
if i'm able to get up and

210
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:38,010
do it at home my feeling is

211
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:40,920
that i want to be if i

212
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,560
can if i'm completely off book then

213
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,360
i can take whatever note is given

214
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,070
to me yeah no without because i

215
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:47,430
don't have to

216
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:49,500
wow so so like if they make

217
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:50,760
if they make me do a tiny

218
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:53,190
adjustment or something then it's like or

219
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:54,338
even if it's like you know sometimes

220
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:56,070
major issue there's there's a made up

221
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:57,630
word or name in the script or

222
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:58,230
it's like i don't know how to

223
00:07:58,230 --> 00:07:59,880
pronounce this i'm going to ask beforehand

224
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,920
but in the meantime i have to

225
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,080
memorize this right you know and so

226
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,940
i might be memorizing this word wrong

227
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:07,440
yeah right and so i want to

228
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:07,666

229
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,090
able to if they tell me like

230
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,762
oh actually it's pronounced this way that

231
00:08:10,762 --> 00:08:12,900

to multiple people this is what happens

283
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:47,820
usually there's one person most often bored

284
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:48,420
disinterested

285
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,190
person who reads the things very flatly

286
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,160
ah but but so you're trying to

287
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:56,070
act to the one person where where

288
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:57,330

00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:56,450
because he had to pay to to

756
00:27:56,450 --> 00:27:57,560
do this thing and he is now

757
00:27:57,590 --> 00:27:58,880
he never did it before and then

758
00:27:58,880 --> 00:27:59,900
and he said that he couldn't he

759
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:00,770
said he could do it because he

760
00:28:00,770 --> 00:28:02,780
was like oh yeah and then we

761
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:04,520
were kind of teaching him and then

762
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:06,290
he has this thing he can do

763
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:08,840
well that you could teach him skating

764
00:28:09,050 --> 00:28:11,540
oh okay and then he roller or

765
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:14,660
ice rollers roller blading and

766
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:17,420
meetings hard too did manage to figure

767
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:18,770
it out and do it but like

768
00:28:18,770 --> 00:28:20,450
your today he did confess to the

769
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:21,890
people he did on the day because

770
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:23,420
he shot multiple days where he didn't

771
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:24,830
have to do it and they want

772
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:26,060
to be liked and and it will

773
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:27,080
heal and he they already knew him

774
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,220
and knew they wanted to turn out

775
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:29,870
a bunch of senior gentleman but he

776
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:31,370
knew that the other part was coming

777
00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:32,690
later and so we had a couple

778
00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:34,280
weeks to like try and they they

779
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:34,790
he told

780
00:28:34,850 --> 00:28:36,080
when they helped him get lessons they

781
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:38,330
talked about oh that always bad though

782
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,000
i don't think so i don't know

784
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,940
ah let's just try to fix this

785
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:46,700

786
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:48,410

today

823
00:30:26,465 --> 00:30:28,295
um what do you do some were

824
00:30:28,325 --> 00:30:30,305
we talking on this note about you

825
00:30:30,425 --> 00:30:32,975
not having your management that water eating

826
00:30:32,976 --> 00:30:35,015
the things you can do to fix

827
00:30:35,015 --> 00:30:38,645
this i don't like this tone i

828
00:30:38,645 --> 00:30:40,055
mean like i get into situations i

829
00:30:40,055 --> 00:30:41,195
think we all do i would like

830
00:30:41,195 --> 00:30:42,575
to know what your tactics are for

831
00:30:42,575 --> 00:30:45,995
like turning it around honestly i tried

832
00:30:45,995 --> 00:30:46,565
to

833
00:30:46,625 --> 00:30:47,285
um

834
00:30:48,605 --> 00:30:49,745
the the biggest

835
00:30:50,945 --> 00:30:53,135
the hardest part and the biggest hurdle

836
00:30:53,165 --> 00:30:53,705
is

837
00:30:54,815 --> 00:30:57,185
to understand that there will be that

838
00:30:57,185 --> 00:30:59,797
this will affect you later the things

839
00:30:59,797 --> 00:31:01,385
that you agree to now are going

840
00:31:01,385 --> 00:31:04,985
to affect you later and that stacking

841
00:31:04,985 --> 00:31:07,565
up so many things is going to

842
00:31:07,565 --> 00:31:10,115
be can be detrimental um but the

843
00:31:10,115 --> 00:31:14,255
problem is it's like it's hard to

844
00:31:14,255 --> 00:31:14,915
know when to say

845
00:31:14,945 --> 00:31:17,705
say when when there's things like we're

846
00:31:17,705 --> 00:31:19,205
going on tour and i'm writing the

847
00:31:19,205 --> 00:31:22,085
script and an audition comes up whatever

848
00:31:22,385 --> 00:31:24,065
then there's all these other things the

849
00:31:24,065 --> 00:31:25,295
florida like i was supposed to do

850
00:31:25,295 --> 00:31:28,055
the um the zillionaires improv show we

851
00:31:28,055 --> 00:31:30,005
do it every month and i didn't

852
00:31:30,005 --> 00:31:31,055
do it because we were flying the

853
00:31:31,055 --> 00:31:32,735
next day and i was like my

854
00:31:32,735 --> 00:31:34,295
tank was empty yeah it's just like

855
00:31:34,505 --> 00:31:35,015
i gotta go

856
00:31:35,075 --> 00:31:36,125
at early yeah you have to be

857
00:31:36,125 --> 00:31:37,505
able to do it yeah yeah and

858
00:31:37,625 --> 00:31:39,995
honestly i'm now thinking about calling in

859
00:31:39,995 --> 00:31:41,975
sick to the show tonight yeah because

860
00:31:41,975 --> 00:31:44,375
most most everybody will be there and

861
00:31:44,375 --> 00:31:46,265
your priority needs to be for needs

862
00:31:46,265 --> 00:31:48,215
to be yeah you're few miles yeah

863
00:31:48,215 --> 00:31:51,065
yeah it's hard because i feel like

864
00:31:51,575 --> 00:31:53,345
i often want to say yes to

865
00:31:53,345 --> 00:31:55,235
everything the dress

866
00:31:55,385 --> 00:31:59,345
the truss but but and then i

867
00:31:59,345 --> 00:32:00,335
feel like i've gotten a little better

868
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:01,715
in the last couple of years at

869
00:32:01,715 --> 00:32:04,865
saying no just to random even things

870
00:32:04,865 --> 00:32:06,335
like i think sound fun like a

871
00:32:06,335 --> 00:32:08,303
podcast silence movie on or something yeah

872
00:32:08,315 --> 00:32:10,055
yeah but then i'm like you know

873
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:12,095
i think it'd probably be better if

874
00:32:12,095 --> 00:32:14,675
i just had that day to even

875
00:32:14,675 --> 00:32:15,305
do nothing

876
00:32:15,545 --> 00:32:16,835
yeah like if there was a chance

877
00:32:16,835 --> 00:32:18,005
that i could and i probably won't

878
00:32:18,005 --> 00:32:19,895
end up being what happened absolutely but

879
00:32:19,895 --> 00:32:21,605
i would like the opportunity to leave

880
00:32:21,605 --> 00:32:23,315
the window for some time in my

881
00:32:23,315 --> 00:32:24,575
week where it's not like every day

882
00:32:24,575 --> 00:32:26,375
i'm running running running running like twenty

883
00:32:26,375 --> 00:32:28,835
things but it's hard to do because

884
00:32:29,495 --> 00:32:32,105
you're pushing yourself and you like you're

885
00:32:32,195 --> 00:32:33,785
the you're the motivator behind your own

886
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:35,521
career yeah and

887
00:32:35,555 --> 00:32:36,725
so it's hard to say no we

888
00:32:36,755 --> 00:32:38,225
and hard to know when to draw

889
00:32:38,225 --> 00:32:39,815
the line when you don't have a

890
00:32:39,905 --> 00:32:41,615
when you don't have a main thing

891
00:32:41,855 --> 00:32:43,655
yeah if you're know your job yeah

892
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:44,735
yeah your job is made up of

893
00:32:44,735 --> 00:32:45,545
a lot of little out of it

894
00:32:45,545 --> 00:32:47,855
yeah yeah then it's it becomes harder

895
00:32:47,855 --> 00:32:49,535
to to conceive of and manage the

896
00:32:49,535 --> 00:32:51,365
time because if it's like i know

897
00:32:51,365 --> 00:32:52,595
i'm going to be at this place

898
00:32:52,655 --> 00:32:54,335
every day from this time to this

899
00:32:54,335 --> 00:32:55,595
time or whatever like

900
00:32:55,745 --> 00:32:59,075

story so you're in her room your

1171
00:43:04,755 --> 00:43:07,425
room and i remember the doors internal

1172
00:43:07,425 --> 00:43:10,095
life that's certainly did my math did

1173
00:43:10,095 --> 00:43:12,915
you chicken in the corner and i

1174
00:43:12,915 --> 00:43:14,685
remember she had a marilyn monroe poster

1175
00:43:14,685 --> 00:43:15,885
and that was where i was kind

1176
00:43:15,885 --> 00:43:18,015
of fixing your gaze no

1177
00:43:22,035 --> 00:43:23,685
speaking of fix my gaze i adjusted

1178
00:43:23,685 --> 00:43:26,715
my balls those other games like kathy

1179
00:43:26,715 --> 00:43:28,815

pants

1181
00:43:30,645 --> 00:43:33,045
so so and but i remember the

1182
00:43:33,045 --> 00:43:35,175
marilyn monroe poster because i started realising

1183
00:43:35,175 --> 00:43:38,025
the sort of cliche of of ah

1184
00:43:38,055 --> 00:43:40,335
girls of that time like all all

1185
00:43:40,335 --> 00:43:42,375
having a marilyn monroe poster up like

1186
00:43:42,375 --> 00:43:44,685
she was the ideal of glamour whatever

1187
00:43:45,135 --> 00:43:48,405
okay so then she she reached over

1188
00:43:48,405 --> 00:43:50,055
to me and she

1189
00:43:50,295 --> 00:43:52,155

00:43:56,175 --> 00:43:57,525
she was a spy and it was

1193
00:43:57,525 --> 00:43:58,185
a dead drop

1194
00:44:02,197 --> 00:44:04,605
the falcon and the snowman situation um

1195
00:44:04,635 --> 00:44:06,465

his third three zero yeah i think

1448
00:54:32,425 --> 00:54:34,105
it might be two hosts give testimony

1449
00:54:34,105 --> 00:54:35,785
to explain their crimes and plead for

1450
00:54:35,785 --> 00:54:38,035
mercy as a disney character decides whether

1451
00:54:38,035 --> 00:54:38,845
or not to free them from the

1452
00:54:38,845 --> 00:54:40,825

1648
01:02:22,260 --> 01:02:24,420
that most people would look down upon

1649
01:02:24,450 --> 01:02:27,480

huh well i didn't know as a

1653
01:02:32,970 --> 01:02:34,770
dine and dash because i'm a dog

1654
01:02:35,070 --> 01:02:37,980
and i thought you think human rules

1655
01:02:37,980 --> 01:02:38,940
don't apply to you

1656
01:02:40,680 --> 01:02:43,440
no they don't i'm a dog okay

1657
01:02:43,470 --> 01:02:45,090
i thought these two human beings are

1658
01:02:45,090 --> 01:02:48,720
so invested in my relationship right i

1659
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:50,340
assumed the meal was free why wouldn't

1660
01:02:50,340 --> 01:02:52,140
it be around around here in the

1661
01:02:52,170 --> 01:02:55,260
transcript that the owner of the restaurant

1662
01:02:55,860 --> 01:02:58,110
came out to the back alley and

1663
01:02:58,110 --> 01:03:00,210

he's dutch mister the tramp here just

1666
01:03:04,380 --> 01:03:06,180
the trump budget for the tramp thought

1667
01:03:06,210 --> 01:03:07,590
that it was spare food that was

1668
01:03:07,590 --> 01:03:09,870
going to be thrown out and then

1669
01:03:09,870 --> 01:03:11,250
he received a bill on his way

1670
01:03:11,250 --> 01:03:13,860
out and they give me food i

1671
01:03:13,860 --> 01:03:15,600
