24
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:03,180
looks at pr team great mashup there

25
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:05,310
people with they also fucked each other

26
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:08,100
ah do you hear about the under

27
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,320
pressure that basically like they had an

28
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,010
agreement freddie mercury and david bowie that

29
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:15,960
they would each go into the studio

30
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:18,390
without hearing what the other person did

31
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:19,980
and just lay down something and they

32
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:21,090
would try to put it on top

33
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:21,990
of each other and see how it

34
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:24,060
came out and david bowie cheated and

35
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:26,370
listen to freddie mercury and came on

36
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,440
and added to it this man yeah

37
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:29,610
he's decided the better way to do

38
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:31,740
more to cheat sometimes yeah and that's

39
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:32,760
why most people do it that way

40
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:34,320
yeah if you're all feeling

41
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,700
what the song yeah why would they

42
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:36,300
agree to that

43
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:39,180
funny and probably a fun game you

44
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:40,830
know yeah but it's it's it's people's

45
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:43,020
jobs you're you're wasting people's time i

46
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,060
was going to imagine something cool happened

47
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:47,160
yeah but we'll never get to because

48
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,270

49
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:49,800

put out offers to people never expecting

189
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:37,440
anyway and then he agreed to do

190
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,120
it right away and i said why

191
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:40,110

192
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:41,580

194
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:46,740

195
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,330
very nice you never see his episode

196
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:50,970

you have to see it adorable it's

204
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,200
worth taking potential cfcs i were with

mastermind right i find when we do

211
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:23,280

way in to be different to play

220
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:39,540
like a big criminal mastermind right because

221
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:40,350

293
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:55,950

294
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:59,880
as well because someone someone layered the

302
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:17,350
video of the crowd and recorded the

303
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:19,930
crowd's reaction to the big like and

304
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:21,880
wherever everyone comes back from yeah and

305
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,350

fun wasn't there wasn't there

309
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:31,420
like i feel like it was in

310
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:33,610
the most recent spiderman movie where all

311
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,920
three spider-man's were in it and like

312
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,750
when andrew garfield showed up there was

313
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:39,730
somebody recorded in the movie or like

314
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:41,950

get cannibals i mean this is the

431
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:38,080
plot of dear evan hansen but it's

432
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,760
like it's it it's a lot of

433
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,700
pressure of like people going through window

434
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:43,720
oh

435
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:45,520
but i don't know any of the

436
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,890
songs i've never saving through her when

437
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:49,900
i hear the movies but the movie's

438
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:52,930
not good but the bombing was great

439
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,370
and i actually listened to the soundtrack

440
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:55,780
before i saw the show which i

441
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:57,490
never do i really enjoyed it but

442
00:14:57,490 --> 00:14:58,508
i made up my own story of

443
00:14:58,508 --> 00:15:00,070
what was happening and it wasn't funny

444
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:01,630
yeah what was the story you made

445
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:03,910
up in my version um

446
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:06,280
the evan dear evan hansen or the

447
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:09,340
character was secretly gay and he and

448
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:10,960
that guy were having a relationship because

449
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:13,090
i didn't understand the letter of it

450
00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:14,954
all because of course i didn't have

451
00:15:14,954 --> 00:15:18,400
ready dialogue necessary domain number two indeed

452
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,470
what was the context clue yeah um

453
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:21,250
as i thought that was a whole

454
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:22,510
storyline and so i was like kind

455
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:23,980
of making all the songs make sense

456
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:24,070
with

457
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:26,260
making the whole storyline i recommend the

458
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:28,420
nineteen ninety four little women over the

459
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:30,370
more recent one oh row saw that

460
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:32,530
one back in the day but i

461
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:35,110
would watch again with wine owner yes

462
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:38,080

465
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:44,230
way i apologize to the entire

466
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:46,540
judge grimm i was very sad yeah

467
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:48,460
that's not something you want to see

468
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:52,450
her memorial was great okay um and

469
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:53,890
why not tell was very funny at

470
00:15:53,890 --> 00:15:56,230
it oh really yeah yeah cracking wise

471
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,210
she's cracking wise she was like doing

472
00:15:58,210 --> 00:15:59,740
a roast of her dear old mama

473
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:01,180
and it was and it was really

474
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:03,310
funny i was i'd never seen her

475
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:04,330
speak that much

476
00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:06,040
much less make jokes it was really

477
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,870
funny okay i'll have to check that

478
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:09,400
out for a good time here's a

479
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:12,700
four good time i'm hearing wanna time

480
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:14,860
here's why i say that is because

481
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:18,460
the nineteen eighty four one is told

482
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:22,300
linearly and the the most recent one

483
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:24,100
shifts back and forth in time it

484
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:24,610
feels for

485
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:27,820
for just arbitrary reasons when it's become

486
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,380
like that's such a thing now where

487
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:31,780
people are telling stories out of order

488
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:34,150
and meanwhile let's go back eighty minutes

489
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:36,580
earlier yeah anyone saying it is a

490
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:39,160
thing to when we were eating lunch

491
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:41,530
yeah janney was watching a show that

492
00:16:41,530 --> 00:16:43,480
was in i think it was in

493
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,770
dutch am

494
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:46,840
and it's about the this cast of

495
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:49,630
characters i'll think in the present and

496
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:50,860
in when they were like in their

497
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:53,500
twenties ah but the people in their

498
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:56,890
twenties look absolutely nothing like that's not

499
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:58,900
good people so it's you'll nothern has

500
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,610
to go on you got passed as

501
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:02,290
close to that as you pause yeah

502
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,730
you have to you know i think

503
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:04,900
senior year did a good

504
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:07,990
job with casting the characters i think

505
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:09,880
it was a good job i think

506
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:12,910

507
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:15,370

each that just liberty guessed your mood

843
00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:28,050
but i also wish i was famous

844
00:29:28,050 --> 00:29:29,040
enough that people knew how to spell

845
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:31,620
my name that is actually driving me

846
00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:32,904
crazy at this point when i see

847
00:29:32,981 --> 00:29:35,430
this point it's like come on google

848
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:37,350
it here's what's really shitting you're typing

849
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:39,450
someone's name googly shit if you're typing

850
00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:41,130
someone's name onto so we predicted the

851
00:29:41,130 --> 00:29:42,420
bear i think should make sure you're

852
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:44,190
spelling it correctly but here's the thing

853
00:29:44,430 --> 00:29:47,040
i get why people think they they

854
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:48,630
hear it and they and they think

855
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:50,910
they got it but most most usually

856
00:29:50,910 --> 00:29:52,230
by the time i'm seeing it like

857
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:54,330
on a placard or something like happen

858
00:29:54,330 --> 00:29:56,700
to comicon it's because it's been written

859
00:29:56,700 --> 00:30:00,090
down by the initial person who thought

860
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:01,140
they knew how to spell right yeah

861
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,370
and then would also just cop why

862
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,500
does anyone think it's thump kins anyway

863
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:07,200
it's it's either falcons

864
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:09,060
because with each and the p yeah

865
00:30:09,090 --> 00:30:11,400
because of that yeah or it's ah

866
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:13,440
t o m k ins or it's

867
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,560
t h o m k ins but

868
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:17,880
the new thing is to what it

869
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:20,250
actually the only time i ever encountered

870
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:22,410
those spellings is when someone is spelling

871
00:30:22,410 --> 00:30:24,900
my name incorrectly because tompkins is not

872
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:26,550
a name because when you see your

873
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:27,330

often when the only time i see

1024
00:35:33,335 --> 00:35:35,615
manageable and american tv is now getting

1025
00:35:35,615 --> 00:35:38,585
that manageable with streaming yeah two episodes

1026
00:35:38,585 --> 00:35:40,505
are you think so well to the

1027
00:35:40,505 --> 00:35:42,635
actors and people who make them detriment

1028
00:35:42,635 --> 00:35:44,015
yeah it's more fun to photograph famous

1029
00:35:44,015 --> 00:35:45,605
people that are in five tv shows

1030
00:35:46,445 --> 00:35:47,645
i think they're doing okay that is

1031
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:49,085
true people do get to do a

1032
00:35:49,085 --> 00:35:50,405
little business sucks

1033
00:35:51,935 --> 00:35:53,315
oh why did we bother it sucks

1034
00:35:53,375 --> 00:35:55,175
getting luckier when there's so many times

1035
00:35:55,175 --> 00:35:56,645
we're actors being like five shows and

1036
00:35:56,645 --> 00:35:57,905
i'm like why are they allowed to

1037
00:35:57,905 --> 00:35:59,315
do that when i feel like i'm

1038
00:35:59,315 --> 00:36:00,395
never allowed to do more than one

1039
00:36:00,395 --> 00:36:02,915

1050
00:36:27,515 --> 00:36:29,615
too vaguely i've been having a lot

1051
00:36:29,615 --> 00:36:31,325
of dreams okay i'm having

1052
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:34,085
a weird thing lately where i actually

1053
00:36:34,085 --> 00:36:36,935
feel very i'm feeling very positive and

1054
00:36:36,935 --> 00:36:41,165
very um like excited creatively about the

1055
00:36:41,165 --> 00:36:42,695
things that i'm doing and really enjoying

1056
00:36:42,695 --> 00:36:46,265
them but i'm having weird stress dreams

1057
00:36:46,865 --> 00:36:50,105
where things are not going well right

1058
00:36:50,135 --> 00:36:51,485
but i'm not feeling like the day

1059
00:36:51,485 --> 00:36:53,885
daylight fear of that stuff like i

1060
00:36:54,005 --> 00:36:55,925
often have in the past so it's

1061
00:36:55,925 --> 00:36:57,425
very strange to me that i'm having

1062
00:36:57,425 --> 00:37:03,125
these these classic stress dreams that i

1063
00:37:03,125 --> 00:37:04,535
used to have when i was feeling

1064
00:37:04,535 --> 00:37:05,735
that way all the time do they

1065
00:37:05,735 --> 00:37:07,445
relate to something else in your life

1066
00:37:07,445 --> 00:37:09,185
though and and your brain is just

1067
00:37:09,185 --> 00:37:10,475
reverting back to oh this is the

1068
00:37:10,475 --> 00:37:11,435
stress dream that night

1069
00:37:11,645 --> 00:37:12,665
to get out of my marriage but

1070
00:37:12,695 --> 00:37:17,465
oh oh well no i don't need

1071
00:37:17,795 --> 00:37:19,265
no i don't i don't know if

1072
00:37:19,265 --> 00:37:21,695
it's like if it's like the vestiges

1073
00:37:21,725 --> 00:37:24,335
of that feeling that i've just made

1074
00:37:24,335 --> 00:37:26,015
with just so long maybe just everyone's

1075
00:37:26,045 --> 00:37:27,635
while they trot out the classics yeah

1076
00:37:27,755 --> 00:37:29,315

we have a family together their mayor

1310
00:46:13,035 --> 00:46:14,685
what i thought was really interesting was

1311
00:46:14,715 --> 00:46:16,605
he did this for all of his

1312
00:46:16,605 --> 00:46:20,085
children he wrote his name on five

1313
00:46:20,085 --> 00:46:21,435
dollar bills and just left them lying

1314
00:46:21,435 --> 00:46:23,025
around that yes and if you figure

1315
00:46:23,025 --> 00:46:24,765
this out then i'm your dad what

1316
00:46:24,765 --> 00:46:26,496
i thought was interesting about it and

1317
00:46:26,625 --> 00:46:27,135
i'm not saying this

1318
00:46:27,135 --> 00:46:28,305
this is good but i thought was

1319
00:46:28,305 --> 00:46:30,345
interesting is that it's almost like a

1320
00:46:30,345 --> 00:46:32,715
reverse link later where instead of revisiting

1321
00:46:32,715 --> 00:46:35,925
these characters taking years to catch various

1322
00:46:35,955 --> 00:46:38,265
points in life it's one twenty four

1323
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:40,785
hour movie yeah and it's twenty four

1324
00:46:40,785 --> 00:46:42,495
hours after their wedding which i thought

1325
00:46:42,495 --> 00:46:44,055
was really interesting they adopted all these

1326
00:46:44,055 --> 00:46:45,795
children in that twenty four hour it's

1327
00:46:45,795 --> 00:46:47,295
really you know not a lot huh

1328
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:49,335
happens in the day no and you're

1329
00:46:49,335 --> 00:46:51,435
very tempted or sleeping they're sleeping for

1330
00:46:51,585 --> 00:46:53,025
they get daily hours of it but

1331
00:46:53,295 --> 00:46:54,795
you don't want to miss anything when

1332
00:46:54,795 --> 00:46:56,355
kenny that the filmmakers seemed to know

1333
00:46:56,355 --> 00:46:57,645
when you the audience member will be

1334
00:46:57,645 --> 00:46:59,535
dropping off to sleep because loud noises

1335
00:46:59,535 --> 00:47:02,325
start yeah right yeah alarms fire alarms

1336
00:47:02,325 --> 00:47:04,335
smoke alarm yes yeah all sorts of

1337
00:47:04,335 --> 00:47:05,655
stuff that the people on screen can

1338
00:47:05,655 --> 00:47:07,305
hear because they're dubbed in later

1339
00:47:07,485 --> 00:47:08,685
no they're not it's part of this

1340
00:47:08,685 --> 00:47:10,755
techno undertake to keep us awake these

1341
00:47:10,755 --> 00:47:12,795
characters can't hear this yeah in case

1342
00:47:12,795 --> 00:47:14,175
you're wondering why they're not react which

1343
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:16,125
sort of made me mad anytime i

1344
00:47:16,125 --> 00:47:17,955
would wake up at you know jarring

1345
00:47:17,955 --> 00:47:19,875
awake and then see that these people

1346
00:47:20,055 --> 00:47:21,165
the worse thing i'm learning is like

1347
00:47:21,165 --> 00:47:23,745
they're they're sleeping peacefully yeah yeah yeah

1348
00:47:23,745 --> 00:47:25,065
here's why i didn't think this movie

1349
00:47:25,065 --> 00:47:26,205
should be made oh i thought we

1350
00:47:26,205 --> 00:47:27,195
were paying more

1351
00:47:28,725 --> 00:47:31,755
you two siskel and ebert always fighting

1352
00:47:33,135 --> 00:47:35,415
okay i won't talk about it sorry

1353
00:47:35,445 --> 00:47:36,435
i think it should have been made

1354
00:47:36,435 --> 00:47:37,965
because obviously it's a horrible idea i

1355
00:47:37,965 --> 00:47:39,615
think why should have been made is

1356
00:47:39,615 --> 00:47:41,055
because we need to know more about

1357
00:47:41,055 --> 00:47:42,645
these characters we go we watched the

1358
00:47:42,645 --> 00:47:44,295
whole first film we'd all go where

1359
00:47:44,295 --> 00:47:45,705
they go this is the first film

1360
00:47:45,705 --> 00:47:47,715
that truly answers the question is there

1361
00:47:47,715 --> 00:47:49,815
a happily ever after yes but how

1362
00:47:49,815 --> 00:47:51,135
many times you watch a movie in

1363
00:47:51,135 --> 00:47:52,395
the movie ends and you go now

1364
00:47:52,395 --> 00:47:53,055
what are they

1365
00:47:53,145 --> 00:47:54,615
oh no it should go why why

1366
00:47:54,615 --> 00:47:55,725
are all these names on i do

1367
00:47:55,725 --> 00:47:58,155
that three players they go into these

1368
00:47:58,275 --> 00:47:59,475
are they all right are they dead

1369
00:47:59,475 --> 00:48:01,065
that's why first i was a day

1370
00:48:01,065 --> 00:48:02,985
off remains the best movie because at

1371
00:48:02,985 --> 00:48:05,895
the end the filmmakers take care to

1372
00:48:05,895 --> 00:48:07,275
have the main character come out and

1373
00:48:07,275 --> 00:48:09,225
say go home the movie is over

1374
00:48:09,315 --> 00:48:11,622
thank you we and i appreciate never

1375
00:48:11,622 --> 00:48:13,215
any other bow off and i do

1376
00:48:13,216 --> 00:48:14,865
don't know what happened and i'm scared

1377
00:48:14,925 --> 00:48:17,145
yes yeah i'm frightened lights come up

1378
00:48:17,145 --> 00:48:18,525
i'm like i'm even more frightened now

1379
00:48:18,525 --> 00:48:20,205
that lights are up yeah absolutely the

1380
00:48:20,205 --> 00:48:22,545
world and the screen has disappeared and

1381
00:48:22,545 --> 00:48:24,615
as my world asbjørn exactly can people

1382
00:48:24,615 --> 00:48:26,895
see me my ghost yeah and this

1383
00:48:26,895 --> 00:48:28,335
film takes care of that and in

1384
00:48:28,335 --> 00:48:30,225
a really interesting way and i also

1385
00:48:30,225 --> 00:48:31,365
love what the film is that it's

1386
00:48:31,365 --> 00:48:33,045
all new actors playing the roles that

1387
00:48:33,045 --> 00:48:33,375
looked none

1388
00:48:33,375 --> 00:48:35,445
nothing like the original cat absolutely nothing

1389
00:48:35,445 --> 00:48:37,305
like them ah there's a difference in

1390
00:48:37,335 --> 00:48:39,735
ages of about forty years yeah um

1391
00:48:39,795 --> 00:48:42,345
and they're all they're all birds as

1392
00:48:42,345 --> 00:48:43,635
well i mean we can spoil it

1393
00:48:43,665 --> 00:48:45,945
but rockers you've seen the trailer you

1394
00:48:45,975 --> 00:48:47,415
know that they're all birds i thought

1395
00:48:47,415 --> 00:48:48,975
i was also weird that the the

1396
00:48:48,975 --> 00:48:51,045
actors playing the parents were also playing

1397
00:48:51,045 --> 00:48:52,905
the children and i would say they

1398
00:48:52,905 --> 00:48:53,535
were able to rang

1399
00:48:53,535 --> 00:48:54,825
like themselves yeah and they were double

1400
00:48:54,825 --> 00:48:56,085
check to their single lines at the

1401
00:48:56,085 --> 00:48:57,735
center like one suggestion i would give

1402
00:48:57,735 --> 00:48:58,635
like i liked how it was called

1403
00:48:58,635 --> 00:49:00,375
seren to pity yeah but i feel

1404
00:49:00,375 --> 00:49:01,845
like could have been seren two can

1405
00:49:01,845 --> 00:49:04,890

1407
00:49:08,535 --> 00:49:10,335

of what does that mean oh i

1409
00:49:12,435 --> 00:49:13,365
just haven't be good

1410
00:49:14,175 --> 00:49:15,135
i thought a good title will be

1411
00:49:15,135 --> 00:49:17,535
serengeti to pity if it had been

1412
00:49:17,565 --> 00:49:20,325
alliance instead of sharing getty typically yeah

1413
00:49:20,385 --> 00:49:22,155
you heard me i thought was interesting

1414
00:49:22,155 --> 00:49:24,165
how one scene in the middle of

1415
00:49:24,165 --> 00:49:26,655
the actors understudies played and what i

1416
00:49:26,655 --> 00:49:27,855
thought was weird was i was called

1417
00:49:27,855 --> 00:49:30,555
usually we're holding stairs it's actually called

1418
00:49:30,555 --> 00:49:33,555
serin get a tipi tonight to notice

1419
00:49:35,925 --> 00:49:39,855
tenants well i on the whole praise

1420
00:49:39,857 --> 00:49:41,445
the movie for the concept i think

1421
00:49:41,445 --> 00:49:43,485
the concept is flawless yeah but the

1422
00:49:43,485 --> 00:49:45,464
execution was a little lacking for the

1423
00:49:45,464 --> 00:49:47,385
execution in the scene in the middle

1424
00:49:47,385 --> 00:49:48,855
of the execution scene yeah it was

1425
00:49:48,855 --> 00:49:51,045
gross and yeah well i didn't die

1426
00:49:51,345 --> 00:49:52,995
it was really raw and you know

1427
00:49:52,995 --> 00:49:54,015
they gave miss last me

1428
00:49:54,015 --> 00:49:55,395
real and he wanted ice cream i

1429
00:49:55,395 --> 00:49:56,475
thought okay i'm gonna watch me to

1430
00:49:56,475 --> 00:49:58,395
gallon of ice cream really the bird

1431
00:49:58,485 --> 00:50:00,255
when they behead him in the guillotine

1432
00:50:00,285 --> 00:50:01,725
than the ice cream spills up the

1433
00:50:01,725 --> 00:50:03,014
neck it's like i didn't have and

1434
00:50:03,014 --> 00:50:04,875
it was like another bird starts eating

1435
00:50:04,875 --> 00:50:06,225
it oh my for it was he

1436
00:50:06,225 --> 00:50:07,905
didn't get to digest it yeah i

1437
00:50:07,905 --> 00:50:08,895
mean you don't even give them a

1438
00:50:08,895 --> 00:50:10,815
minute it was also store brand ice

1439
00:50:10,815 --> 00:50:11,925

in the face it was kroger i

1441
00:50:13,065 --> 00:50:13,875
thought that was kind of like

1442
00:50:14,175 --> 00:50:16,005
we have just for the sake of

1443
00:50:16,005 --> 00:50:17,685

00:50:25,065 --> 00:50:26,385
committed but i feel that he could

1449
00:50:26,385 --> 00:50:27,975

1450
00:50:27,975 --> 00:50:29,085

1460
00:50:44,925 --> 00:50:45,165

yeah what are you doing i i

1464
00:50:51,765 --> 00:50:52,845
i did an end run because i

1465
00:50:52,845 --> 00:50:54,255
thought i bet the quality of the

1466
00:50:54,255 --> 00:50:55,725
last meal is not that good so

1467
00:50:55,725 --> 00:50:56,985
i said i want a swanson tv

1468
00:50:56,985 --> 00:50:58,755
dinner because i know what that is

1469
00:50:58,815 --> 00:51:00,375
i know what to expect got it

1470
00:51:00,405 --> 00:51:02,895
um i'm getting the salisbury steak mashed

1471
00:51:02,895 --> 00:51:05,595
potatoes and the little apple pie you

1472
00:51:05,595 --> 00:51:06,435
do worry it won't be

1473
00:51:07,125 --> 00:51:08,925
yeah that's fine oh i forgot it's

1474
00:51:08,925 --> 00:51:10,185
only heat it up they might give

1475
00:51:10,185 --> 00:51:12,490
it to co no frozen i didn't

1476
00:51:12,490 --> 00:51:14,025
think any of us yeah bro i

1477
00:51:14,025 --> 00:51:15,885
requested watch frozen two things that kevin

1478
00:51:15,885 --> 00:51:18,765
had a parrot but what's that you

1479
00:51:18,765 --> 00:51:19,755
have to tell them how to prepare

1480
00:51:19,755 --> 00:51:21,711
it yeah i guess that's allowed the

1481
00:51:21,711 --> 00:51:23,745
last detail yeah yeah yeah so i

1482
00:51:23,745 --> 00:51:24,704
think anyone would know to put it

1483
00:51:24,704 --> 00:51:26,235
in the microwave because a lot of

1484
00:51:26,235 --> 00:51:27,285
times people asked for fried

1485
00:51:27,285 --> 00:51:29,595
chicken ah they'll just get a chicken

1486
00:51:29,595 --> 00:51:30,465
and a fryer and then they have

1487
00:51:30,465 --> 00:51:32,145
to do it themselves yeah that's tedious

1488
00:51:32,218 --> 00:51:33,645
now that you've had a consuming like

1489
00:51:33,645 --> 00:51:35,115
a friar like people to make their

1490
00:51:35,115 --> 00:51:37,455
own last meals do people understand that

1491
00:51:37,845 --> 00:51:40,215
the prisoners know or don't don't and

1492
00:51:40,215 --> 00:51:42,165
don't order something too complicated yeah because

1493
00:51:42,165 --> 00:51:43,275
you're going to be there all night

1494
00:51:43,335 --> 00:51:44,985
i'd say if i simply p b

1495
00:51:44,985 --> 00:51:46,785
and j was just gonna say yeah

1496
00:51:46,815 --> 00:51:47,445
you just stop

1497
00:51:47,475 --> 00:51:50,355
together anyway i mean slapped together i

1498
00:51:50,355 --> 00:51:51,855
thought this movie like why didn't the

1499
00:51:51,855 --> 00:51:53,205
other movie right why didn't they turn

1500
00:51:53,205 --> 00:51:55,545
the cameras on well it was all

1501
00:51:55,545 --> 00:51:56,565
supposed to be audio i think that

1502
00:51:56,565 --> 00:51:58,515
was like a sort of so strange

1503
00:51:58,515 --> 00:51:59,535
because you could hear them go should

1504
00:51:59,535 --> 00:52:01,531
return these on and if someone didn't

1505
00:52:01,531 --> 00:52:03,015
know don't worry about they didn't edit

1506
00:52:03,015 --> 00:52:04,095
that out which was the point of

1507
00:52:04,095 --> 00:52:06,135
the polaroids but they described the ice

1508
00:52:06,135 --> 00:52:07,410
cream pouring out of his neck and

1509
00:52:07,410 --> 00:52:07,545
at

1510
00:52:07,605 --> 00:52:08,895
the point is some of it was

1511
00:52:08,895 --> 00:52:11,895
the descriptive yeah yeah and we also

1512
00:52:11,895 --> 00:52:12,885
we don't even know if that's actually

1513
00:52:12,885 --> 00:52:15,375
what happened yeah oh yeah oh hey

1514
00:52:15,405 --> 00:52:16,515
i mean that's how you save on

1515
00:52:16,515 --> 00:52:18,135
it probably was with a they'd probably

1516
00:52:18,135 --> 00:52:19,785
didn't film anything because i remember it

1517
00:52:19,785 --> 00:52:21,165
was the director's voice at the very

1518
00:52:21,165 --> 00:52:23,025
beginning saying this is this is what

1519
00:52:23,025 --> 00:52:23,925
happens to the movie you'll have to

1520
00:52:23,925 --> 00:52:25,455
take my word for it yeah and

1521
00:52:25,455 --> 00:52:27,345
