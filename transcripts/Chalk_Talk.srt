follower and

77
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:01,860
it's a screen shot of a clickbait

78
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,260
news ad or whatever you'd call it

79
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,780
and it's a sponsored post and it's

80
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:10,140
a picture of well that's the headline

81
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:12,330
says his ex wife dropped a bombshell

82
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:14,250
in d'avoir data that so i'm guessing

83
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:17,310
something about divorcing and there's three pages

84
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:19,200
of abuse the town divorce

85
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:22,230
chilling divorce and then three faces of

86
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:23,880
shock and horror and then the the

87
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:26,160
couple is me and d j qualls

88
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:26,820
next to each other

89
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:28,770

00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:33,480

we're married and apparently i divorced him

97
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:50,790
and it's pretty great oh so that

98
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:52,740

99
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:54,810

190
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:04,170

address one where they draft people oh

194
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:12,960

of volunteers nowadays yeah is that really

197
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,510
why because people are volunteering so we

don't have to draft well no big

199
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:23,790

more saints gone out of fashion but

202
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,140
they don't draft people just to be

203
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:33,390

335
00:11:59,473 --> 00:12:01,070
each far longer had a little referee

336
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:03,080
in there oh really like yeah just

337
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,280
sitting in the cupboard yes to keep

338
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,210
the clothes separated

339
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:07,850
i used to call that movie the

340
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:10,550
engine in the breadbox huh just to

341
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:12,890
be offensive i guess well i was

342
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:14,660
fifteen i went to see it with

343
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:15,920
my mom and it made her laugh

344
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:17,420
so hey

345
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,560
that's her uber all right yeah tell

346
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:24,950
me about it i'm red boxes wait

347
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:27,260
so what would happen at these lunches

348
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:31,820
well he would explain what my duties

349
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:33,920
would be the army the marines it

350
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,450
was that she was the army army

351
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,550
and do it because i think the

352
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,450
my high school was

353
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:40,280
right next to a recruitment centre right

354
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,410
um and so yeah he would just

355
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:45,590
basically like he would really gloss over

356
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:47,480
basic training like oh that's no big

357
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,730
deal and that's and that's the end

358
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:51,350
but you know in the eighties like

359
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:53,480
every army movie was about basic training

360
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:55,280
and how early well yeah i don't

361
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,500
know if that's the case i you

362
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:58,610
know i have all i've seen

363
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:00,650
or movies then say it's horrible but

364
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:02,150
i wonder if it's like fine now

365
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:03,770
there's just no way it's good now

366
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:05,030
it's gonna be really hard is that

367
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:06,260
the whole point that they're showing you

368
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:07,310
like how hard you can push your

369
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:09,260
body well yeah and there's trying to

370
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:11,240
break you down to where you don't

371
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,580
question things anymore yeah you're not like

372
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:15,380

373
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:17,480

374
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,740
i'm just getting that from movies

375
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,240
no well i think it is it

376
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,700
is about i think conditioning you to

377
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:25,070
be a unit you know because they

378
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:27,410
you're not i mean i don't believe

379
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:29,060
that is supposed to be about individualism

380
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:31,490
in right yeah but ah and also

381
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:32,600
you're not supposed to be the type

382
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,710
of person who have someone gives an

383
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:35,630
order you're like well what i'm okay

384
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:37,730
that's good but what if we you

385
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:38,990
know you're just supposed to follow

386
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:41,000
yeah what have we did it oh

387
00:13:41,007 --> 00:13:43,520
nine hundred hours kind just snooze a

388
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,440
little on the other running can you

389
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,150
imagine like having a run i mean

390
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:49,580
so hard i mean it's very impressive

391
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,860
pulling like just doing pull-ups i did

392
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:54,590
you ever take the presidential fitness oh

393
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:56,420
yes i did not why didn't you

394
00:13:56,450 --> 00:13:58,220
did you abstain i don't yeah i

395
00:13:58,220 --> 00:13:59,150
was conscientious object

396
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:01,460
yeah i don't know why we didn't

397
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:02,900
at my school but i don't remember

398
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:04,400
taking that at all what is that

399
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,570
was how you became president

400
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:08,960
well we wouldn't have our current disqualified

401
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:10,610
it's

402
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:13,070
did you not take it nowhere was

403
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:14,630
it not a thing but it was

404
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:16,940
why is it called presidential i guess

405
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:20,150
because the president made it an issue

406
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:22,220
of like every school child should be

407
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:24,560
should have a basic level of fitness

408
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:26,240
i can't remember who instituted that but

409
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,790
it was it must have been at

410
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:30,950
least carter because i remember taking it

411
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:34,520
ah don't worry we did some work

412
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:35,840
at least like that if it wasn't

413
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,010
that but it was like we had

414
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:38,742
to do the sit and reach or

415
00:14:38,742 --> 00:14:39,980
you like didn't did you do that

416
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:41,300
where it's like oh what's up along

417
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:43,100
with l b j j o b

418
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:46,280
j wang ruler on a really long

419
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,960
couple rulers connected or something on top

420
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:48,950
of a milk crate maybe that's just

421
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:50,600
my cheap school and then you'd put

422
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,950
your feet against the mill like

423
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:53,570
it's just an aisle of gold and

424
00:14:53,570 --> 00:14:55,820
other schools and they were maybe like

425
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:57,290
a real ruler that's made to be

426
00:14:57,290 --> 00:14:58,820
the length of the thing you would

427
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:01,070
like then what like a fourteen inch

428
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:03,500
ruler like they were making these special

429
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:06,440
just for this fitness really was like

430
00:15:06,804 --> 00:15:09,500
yardstick probably and then you're trying to

431
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,480
like put your feet against ammo crate

432
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,110
and it went past

433
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:13,070
at the edge of the milk crate

434
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,840
and you would lean forward with your

435
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,800
hands on top of each other and

436
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,720
try to press the furthest number you

437
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,460
could and then that was your score

438
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:20,330
so if you get like i got

439
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:21,890
like as far as i could reach

440
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:24,076
sixty inches or something that's not like

441
00:15:24,076 --> 00:15:25,010
your age sixty nine

442
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:28,070
three cats and then we had to

443
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:30,093
do like the hang or the pull

444
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,280
ups or either yeah that's really going

445
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,270
to hang and hang for a really

446
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:34,130
long time i you were supposed to

447
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:37,100
do overhand pull-ups but i could only

448
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,260
do underhand and maybe wanted that you

449
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:40,490
know and that i've for some reason

450
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:41,480
i've just never been able to do

451
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,890
pull-ups do you have to climb rope

452
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:44,630
in your gym you know what i

453
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:46,177
was forced to to

454
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:50,000
take gymnastics when i was ten and

455
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,640
eleven or so by my parents ah

456
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:55,550
because when i ah ok so here

457
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:58,070
i grew up no the end

458
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:03,260
um when i was six seven and

459
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:06,830
eight i ah was in baseball was

460
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:08,360
in little league did you guys ever

461
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:11,450
do literally deserted by baseball my school

462
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:12,920
okay in eighth grade so but this

463
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:15,230
was like during the the you know

464
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:17,900
afternoons and evening games and stuff like

465
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:19,310
that nighttime yeah

466
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,220
yeah and i sleep sleep time um

467
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:24,200
good night moon the dark of night

468
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:28,070
the dark knight rises um so i

469
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,660
for three years in a row i

470
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:32,090
was forced to and this is my

471
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:33,500
recollection of it i was forced to

472
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:36,920
play baseball little league ah and my

473
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:39,140
coaches would always yell at me and

474
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:39,290
the

475
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,300
the team hated me and i couldn't

476
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:44,120
bat for shit and ah at one

477
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:46,100
point ah i was always made to

478
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,960
play right field because that's where noble

479
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,700
two that's right and at one point

480
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:51,589
someone hit a fly ball and it

481
00:16:51,589 --> 00:16:52,730
hit me right in the nuts

482
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:55,910
and then you win ten grand max

483
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:58,970
wish i got the last laugh

484
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:02,780
so so i i remember and there

485
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:03,980
were so many afternoons where i was

486
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:05,510
crying and crying and saying i don't

487
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:06,530
want to go i don't want to

488
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:08,030
go and they forced me to go

489
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:10,070
and so then after my third year

490
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:11,300
i was just like i can't do

491
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:12,170
it i don't want to do it

492
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:14,030
anymore please don't make me go and

493
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:15,890
they said okay well you have to

494
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,570
take gymnastics then or you have to

495
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:19,070
do something else first it was to

496
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:20,120
get made fun of for

497
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,800
yeah and and i could see the

498
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:24,470
carter then you don't like that they'll

499
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:28,100
flip around being and a unitar so

500
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:30,890
here's what here's what actually happened and

501
00:17:30,890 --> 00:17:32,450
they didn't tell me this until i

502
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:35,240
was twenty maybe when i stopped having

503
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:35,720
your cycle

504
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:40,580
when i went into kindergarten they did

505
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,030
i guess the kindergarten ah equivalent of

506
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:45,920
the presidential test but they just revised

507
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:46,850
presidential for this

508
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:48,740
they were just trying to figure out

509
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:50,990
your basic level of fitness and i

510
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:52,640
couldn't i guess i i could not

511
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,490
hop on one foot i was so

512
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:58,400
uncoordinated that they were like you need

513
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,280
to get him involved in some sort

514
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,040
of like physical activity and so they

515
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,270
put me into these things but they

516
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:06,770
never told me it was because of

517
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:07,940
that they say

518
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:09,620
just helped you they were just saying

519
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:11,090
like you have to do this and

520
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,190
they never gave me a reason wow

521
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:15,440
yeah so i took i took gymnastics

522
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:19,400
um from ten until twelve or something

523
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,540
like that and i was forced to

524
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:22,430
go to a i couldn't just go

525
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:24,080

saw them but they were like maybe

762
00:26:25,925 --> 00:26:27,395

763
00:26:27,395 --> 00:26:29,255

770
00:26:42,185 --> 00:26:44,135
but these were like holy shit commemorating

771
00:26:44,405 --> 00:26:46,955
so i e i saved up my

772
00:26:46,955 --> 00:26:49,625
car wheel money and i know i

773
00:26:49,625 --> 00:26:50,675
paid all that to the tip

774
00:26:52,595 --> 00:26:53,765
but i bought a pair of mirrored

775
00:26:53,765 --> 00:26:55,235
sunglasses and they were expensive i think

776
00:26:55,235 --> 00:26:56,495
they were like three dollars or something

777
00:26:56,495 --> 00:27:00,065
like that and i bought them and

778
00:27:00,065 --> 00:27:01,355
i was riding my bike around by

779
00:27:01,355 --> 00:27:05,075
myself and i thought to myself these

780
00:27:05,105 --> 00:27:06,515
are so cool you can't see my

781
00:27:06,515 --> 00:27:09,695
eyes it would be so cool to

782
00:27:09,695 --> 00:27:11,555
be like riding my bike with my

783
00:27:11,555 --> 00:27:12,035
eyes clue

784
00:27:12,035 --> 00:27:14,315
closed and everyone looking at me saying

785
00:27:14,345 --> 00:27:17,375
oh hey like obviously thinking well that's

786
00:27:17,375 --> 00:27:19,805
a kid with his eyes open and

787
00:27:19,805 --> 00:27:21,755
but they wouldn't know that my eyes

788
00:27:21,755 --> 00:27:23,915
are closed because i have these mirrored

789
00:27:23,915 --> 00:27:26,882
sunglasses so i love kid logic because

790
00:27:26,882 --> 00:27:27,935
like why even thinking

791
00:27:29,105 --> 00:27:30,005
so i was like you know what

792
00:27:30,005 --> 00:27:32,945
i should do i should start at

793
00:27:33,065 --> 00:27:34,415
the other end of the street because

794
00:27:34,415 --> 00:27:36,185
my house was was on one end

795
00:27:36,185 --> 00:27:38,075
of the street i should start on

796
00:27:38,075 --> 00:27:39,665
one end of the street and i'll

797
00:27:39,695 --> 00:27:41,825
with my eyes open i'll count how

798
00:27:41,855 --> 00:27:43,835
all count how long it takes me

799
00:27:43,835 --> 00:27:46,865
to ride my bike from here to

800
00:27:46,865 --> 00:27:49,235
my house right and then i'll go

801
00:27:49,265 --> 00:27:51,155
back and i'll do it with my

802
00:27:51,185 --> 00:27:54,515
eyes closed and it'll be so awesome

803
00:27:54,515 --> 00:27:57,005
because idiots these idiots no one will

804
00:27:57,005 --> 00:27:59,165
know they'll still be thinking to themselves

805
00:27:59,345 --> 00:28:01,265
look there's a normal kid drives like

806
00:28:01,832 --> 00:28:03,845
cooler to have people see that your

807
00:28:03,845 --> 00:28:05,885
eyes were closed right but no one

808
00:28:05,885 --> 00:28:08,190
was around but this is like and

809
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:09,395
no one there were no windsor

810
00:28:09,395 --> 00:28:11,015
there's no one here it's a ghost

811
00:28:11,015 --> 00:28:12,545
town on my street and that's why

812
00:28:12,545 --> 00:28:13,865
i think i've felt like i was

813
00:28:13,865 --> 00:28:15,845
safe too because there's no traffic or

814
00:28:15,845 --> 00:28:17,765
anything like that so i i go

815
00:28:17,765 --> 00:28:18,935
to one end of the street and

816
00:28:18,935 --> 00:28:21,335
i countdown it's like ah thirty three

817
00:28:21,335 --> 00:28:23,525
seconds right i'm like ok alright so

818
00:28:23,585 --> 00:28:26,105
at at thirty three i'm gonna open

mean mein jab from um a you

868
00:30:20,165 --> 00:30:21,632
reminded me of two stories one is

869
00:30:21,632 --> 00:30:23,435
that this new rog moved to my

870
00:30:23,435 --> 00:30:26,345
school um and she moved to like

871
00:30:26,345 --> 00:30:27,155
my neighborhood and

872
00:30:27,155 --> 00:30:28,295
and my friend and i went to

873
00:30:28,295 --> 00:30:29,165
go hang out with her one day

874
00:30:29,165 --> 00:30:30,785
we went to her backyard to play

875
00:30:31,175 --> 00:30:33,185
and she wanted to play blind man's

876
00:30:33,185 --> 00:30:34,235
bluff i don't think it's the my

877
00:30:34,235 --> 00:30:35,645
other friend to play bindmans but which

878
00:30:35,645 --> 00:30:37,355
i thought that was called blind man's

879
00:30:37,355 --> 00:30:40,685
buff because the man's naked yeah that's

880
00:30:40,685 --> 00:30:40,955
how we

881
00:30:42,625 --> 00:30:45,085
yeah makes sense i can't remember what

882
00:30:45,085 --> 00:30:46,705
that game so it's i think what

883
00:30:46,705 --> 00:30:48,385
it is is that it's like kind

884
00:30:48,385 --> 00:30:50,245
of like marco polo on languages as

885
00:30:50,245 --> 00:30:51,535
some kids were playing that the other

886
00:30:51,535 --> 00:30:52,525
day when i was staying at a

887
00:30:52,525 --> 00:30:53,965
hotel and they were playing the fool

888
00:30:53,965 --> 00:30:55,675
that is a dangerous game it doesn't

889
00:30:55,675 --> 00:30:58,075
make someone using your module paulo well

890
00:30:58,075 --> 00:31:01,045
especially with like kids running around at

891
00:31:01,045 --> 00:31:02,785
the pool and everyone's closing their eyes

892
00:31:02,785 --> 00:31:04,825
eyes and there my first concussion i

893
00:31:04,825 --> 00:31:07,255
think was from running alongside the first

894
00:31:07,465 --> 00:31:09,505
kitchen and then you played nashville for

895
00:31:09,505 --> 00:31:11,035
seven years i've had i think two

896
00:31:11,065 --> 00:31:14,785
concussions um but this was so this

897
00:31:15,115 --> 00:31:17,035
blind man's bluff are playing so basically

898
00:31:17,035 --> 00:31:18,205
the new girl was going to be

899
00:31:18,205 --> 00:31:19,855
the blind man he closed her eyes

900
00:31:19,855 --> 00:31:21,415
we run around and she has to

901
00:31:21,415 --> 00:31:22,255
find us by the sound of our

902
00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:22,885
voice and

903
00:31:22,945 --> 00:31:24,085
and with her eyes closed yes like

904
00:31:24,085 --> 00:31:27,115
tagged someone yeah yeah and it was

905
00:31:27,115 --> 00:31:28,765
fun for about eight seconds then she

906
00:31:28,765 --> 00:31:31,495
ran full steam into a tree like

907
00:31:31,495 --> 00:31:33,475
a big tree and her nose just

908
00:31:33,475 --> 00:31:36,355
like explode oh it was insane and

909
00:31:36,355 --> 00:31:37,855
then her nanny came out which i

910
00:31:37,855 --> 00:31:40,345
had never known anyone to have yeah

911
00:31:40,525 --> 00:31:42,925

by you staying away or like what

1083
00:37:04,405 --> 00:37:06,145

1120
00:38:25,585 --> 00:38:27,355
where we are just you know like

1121
00:38:27,385 --> 00:38:28,945
you know you pull back a rubber

1122
00:38:28,945 --> 00:38:31,219

you should remember mazzy just fancy so

1124
00:38:33,415 --> 00:38:35,095

1125
00:38:35,125 --> 00:38:35,875
parents

1126
00:38:37,285 --> 00:38:39,865

my great aunt was not fair so

1128
00:38:41,515 --> 00:38:42,505
it may have been she had just

1129
00:38:42,505 --> 00:38:44,657
passed away i can't remember because i

1130
00:38:44,725 --> 00:38:46,915
believe my parents were packing up her

1131
00:38:46,915 --> 00:38:48,925
stuff so either they either she'd passed

1132
00:38:48,925 --> 00:38:50,425
away or were they robbing her

1133
00:38:52,225 --> 00:38:54,925
the airfare right up into dollars label

1134
00:38:56,665 --> 00:38:58,345
they may be moving her to the

1135
00:38:58,345 --> 00:39:00,265
home where she ended up that's probably

1136
00:39:00,265 --> 00:39:02,845

1137
00:39:02,845 --> 00:39:04,225

00:40:41,845 --> 00:40:42,775
time that i hit my head on

1186
00:40:42,775 --> 00:40:45,115
the radiator um i had a babysitter

1187
00:40:45,115 --> 00:40:47,335
over and i was bouncing on the

1188
00:40:47,335 --> 00:40:48,565

1196
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:02,220

1197
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:03,300
you might have just been a senior

1198
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:04,980

1199
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:06,840
he knows right i mean i don't

1200
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:09,660

1201
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:11,670

00:41:23,250 --> 00:41:25,440
my friend natalie who's my best friend

1207
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,660
to this day and we would always

1208
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:28,770
just drive around to listen to music

1209
00:41:28,770 --> 00:41:29,820
like once we had the abyss

1210
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:31,590
oddity to drive so i was alone

1211
00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:32,490
with the car and we were just

1212
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:33,990
like drive around was fourth of july

1213
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:35,160
or the third of july but my

1214
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:36,540
town does fireworks on the third as

1215
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:38,250
well and i think it was the

1216
00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:40,020
fourth of july yeah i think it

1366
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:11,520
actually i was seventeen i was driving

1367
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:13,260
around by myself and i had an

1368
00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:13,980
experience where all

1369
00:46:14,010 --> 00:46:15,480
of the cops in where i grew

1370
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:17,040
up or it's a private town you

1371
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:18,930
know so it's like they they're a

1372
00:46:18,930 --> 00:46:21,390
lot of them and they're constantly patrolling

1373
00:46:21,390 --> 00:46:23,910
constantly you know pulling people over so

1374
00:46:23,910 --> 00:46:25,170
i put their cups they're not like

1375
00:46:25,170 --> 00:46:27,540
security know their collars but but it's

1376
00:46:27,540 --> 00:46:30,030
like it's like burbank where you know

1377
00:46:30,030 --> 00:46:31,320
it's a private town and they have

1378
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:32,820
their own police force i don't know

1379
00:46:32,820 --> 00:46:34,110
they have a weird rule and

1380
00:46:34,170 --> 00:46:35,760
rank that i just learned that um

1381
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:37,350
you can't put on a drag show

1382
00:46:37,350 --> 00:46:39,390
in a public establish establishment really and

1383
00:46:39,390 --> 00:46:41,340
there's all like a law i just

1384
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:43,350
saw something on twitter about it interested

1385
00:46:43,350 --> 00:46:44,820
did somebody get in trouble for having

1386
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:47,070
yeah this show is cancelled and then

1387
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:49,860
um daniel franzese he would think i

1388
00:46:49,870 --> 00:46:50,910
was being about being like we have

1389
00:46:50,910 --> 00:46:51,720
to like make a change i think

1390
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:52,590
that would be one of those things

1391
00:46:52,590 --> 00:46:54,210
where they're like oh there's this antiquated

1392
00:46:54,210 --> 00:46:54,300
law

1393
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:55,857
la but no one right which it

1394
00:46:55,857 --> 00:46:57,750
sounds like some old fashioned thing that

1395
00:46:57,780 --> 00:46:59,850
yeah but i guess somehow we think

1396
00:46:59,850 --> 00:47:02,790
it was arrival drag queen shut them

1397
00:47:04,050 --> 00:47:04,680
sounds like a movie

1398
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:08,610
it's like i just put out just

1399
00:47:08,610 --> 00:47:10,500
went out because of this letter we

1400
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:12,660
got right this movie yeah yeah um

1401
00:47:12,690 --> 00:47:14,100
so there was a period of time

1402
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:15,810
where i was constantly being pulled over

1403
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:18,300
for various things and um and i

1404
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:20,790
found out once later by a different

1405
00:47:20,790 --> 00:47:22,470
cop that the reason i was constantly

1406
00:47:22,470 --> 00:47:23,580
being pulled over because i had a

1407
00:47:23,580 --> 00:47:25,770
lot of stickers yeah carre about this

1408
00:47:25,770 --> 00:47:25,980
yeah

1409
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:28,200
and one of them was a what

1410
00:47:28,230 --> 00:47:29,610

1411
00:47:29,610 --> 00:47:32,520
one love and people think you're a

1412
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:34,103
hippie then people thought smoking that it

1413
00:47:34,103 --> 00:47:36,090
was possible because they're like they're like

1414
00:47:36,090 --> 00:47:37,740
where's all your pod and it was

1415
00:47:37,740 --> 00:47:39,150

1416
00:47:39,150 --> 00:47:40,260

1439
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:35,010
my life that i never brought up

1440
00:48:35,010 --> 00:48:37,620
the logic of of why that were

1441
00:48:37,620 --> 00:48:38,220
like deep dark

1442
00:48:38,264 --> 00:48:40,770
secrets that i think years later i

1443
00:48:40,770 --> 00:48:42,450
finally admitted there was that one and

1444
00:48:42,450 --> 00:48:44,310
then there was the time there was

1445
00:48:44,310 --> 00:48:47,040
the time that i woke up and

1446
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:48,360
didn't want to go to school and

1447
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:50,280
took a red marking pen and drew

1448
00:48:50,310 --> 00:48:52,890
dots all over my face like i

1449
00:48:52,890 --> 00:48:54,540

1450
00:48:54,540 --> 00:48:57,450

i don't know what your diet yeah

1456
00:49:06,540 --> 00:49:08,880

00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:10,680
to take you to a doctor and

1458
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:12,150

00:58:01,470 --> 00:58:03,420
someone's here a long period of time

1710
00:58:03,450 --> 00:58:06,000
because if they're clean they've just had

1711
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,500
some sort of liquid all over him

1712
00:58:07,890 --> 00:58:09,180
