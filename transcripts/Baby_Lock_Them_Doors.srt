this thing and it was it wasn't

217
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:43,560
gaining traction fast enough and then a

218
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,970
lot of time and we just came

219
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,311
let's do it for scotty mccreery now

220
00:07:47,311 --> 00:07:49,860

221
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,320
dirt lane around boo

222
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:54,510
alright so i was gonna tell was

223
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:56,165
that i went to a workout like

224
00:07:56,349 --> 00:07:57,450
i went to a place i'd never

225
00:07:57,450 --> 00:08:00,300
been for an exercise class a gymnasium

226
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:03,060
it's a boutique pilati studio and i

227
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:04,710
don't want to name the place because

228
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:05,910
i don't want to drag them but

229
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:07,230
i also don't want to cross streets

230
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:08,700
though no but i also don't want

231
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:09,810
to but i also feel that the

232
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:11,400
name is really essential because it's a

233
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,660
huge part of the theme of the

234
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:13,020
place

235
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:15,720

can find a place to work out

266
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:12,360
there used to be in when i

267
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,440
was going to school in santa maria

268
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:13,680
there was

269
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:15,000
a gym that you could pay a

270
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,530
daily rate to like if you ever

271
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:19,380
went and i loved it and then

272
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,580
i went to when i when i

273
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:22,830
moved back here ah i went to

274
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:24,210
gold's gym and i was like couldn't

275
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:25,440
i do what they did over there

276
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,480
and they're like no because it's like

277
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,830
their whole business model is getting you

278
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:30,060
to pay for something you've never doing

279
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:33,180
right um so this place i've been

280
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:33,750
you said right

281
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:35,640
you are patronizing me i think i

282
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,930
just wanted you to stop talking oh

283
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:38,130
okay got it that's how it read

284
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:38,850
to me okay done

285
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:42,930
so i saw i've seen this place

286
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:44,010
pop up a handful of times and

287
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:47,100
it's new and it's like ah felt

288
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:48,780
like special compared to the other places

289
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:50,550

let me tell you i mean it's

292
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:54,900
a commitment for me to try it

293
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,280
because it was like a forty minute

294
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,770
drive to forty manic in the morning

295
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:00,150

yeah really classical and the class is

297
00:10:03,725 --> 00:10:05,135
fifty minutes which is how many minutes

but it's like not the point of

361
00:12:14,735 --> 00:12:15,785
working out to me is not about

362
00:12:15,785 --> 00:12:18,425
how i am yes it becomes clear

363
00:12:18,425 --> 00:12:20,495
that it matters because we get into

364
00:12:20,495 --> 00:12:21,725
the room that i meet the teacher

365
00:12:21,725 --> 00:12:23,375

371
00:12:32,645 --> 00:12:33,455
much prefer

372
00:12:33,515 --> 00:12:35,555
that too the hard handshake that i've

373
00:12:35,555 --> 00:12:37,685
been getting from people lately i like

374
00:12:37,685 --> 00:12:39,485
where they're squeezing my hand and i'm

375
00:12:39,485 --> 00:12:41,211
go out like literally like well there's

376
00:12:41,225 --> 00:12:42,965
a middle ground but like i don't

377
00:12:42,965 --> 00:12:44,735
like what a normal handshake it made

378
00:12:44,735 --> 00:12:46,063
me feel like i'm like a a

379
00:12:46,145 --> 00:12:47,405
woman going i'm a woman and she

380
00:12:47,405 --> 00:12:48,845
was like i'm a real woman like

381
00:12:48,845 --> 00:12:51,485
it was like yeah i'm definitely dainty

382
00:12:51,485 --> 00:12:53,165
i'm gonna dainty the fuck out yeah

383
00:12:53,195 --> 00:12:53,675
and so i didn't like

384
00:12:53,705 --> 00:12:55,835
that and then i i didn't like

385
00:12:55,835 --> 00:12:57,035
the conversation the women were having because

386
00:12:57,035 --> 00:12:58,715
they were like one one was in

387
00:12:58,715 --> 00:12:59,735
germany and then the other one was

388
00:12:59,735 --> 00:13:01,055
like ah

389
00:13:01,115 --> 00:13:03,065
germany is just like america like it's

390
00:13:03,065 --> 00:13:05,195
like it's just like america with more

391
00:13:05,195 --> 00:13:06,845
pretzels like you could be in washington

392
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:07,985
for all you know like it's just

393
00:13:07,985 --> 00:13:09,515
like nature and she's like it's really

394
00:13:09,515 --> 00:13:10,833
pretty like she's trying like makeup because

395
00:13:10,836 --> 00:13:12,005
the other woman had just been there

396
00:13:12,035 --> 00:13:13,265
oh yeah and it was like she's

397
00:13:13,265 --> 00:13:15,245
basically negating yeah person going i went

398
00:13:15,245 --> 00:13:16,655
to germany i loved it oh yeah

399
00:13:16,655 --> 00:13:18,515
that sucks yeah and then we get

400
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:21,125
the exercise class and they start filming

401
00:13:21,125 --> 00:13:21,245
them

402
00:13:21,305 --> 00:13:23,165
rooms is this feeling you do traveling

403
00:13:23,165 --> 00:13:25,355
from room to anteroom know is two

404
00:13:25,565 --> 00:13:26,255
and then we get in the room

405
00:13:26,255 --> 00:13:28,895
and they start instagramming while we wait

406
00:13:29,525 --> 00:13:31,565
to start and it's just me three

407
00:13:31,565 --> 00:13:32,645
women who are together and then some

408
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:33,635
other woman who like doesn't speak the

409
00:13:33,635 --> 00:13:34,955
whole time it's probably more on my

410
00:13:34,955 --> 00:13:37,055
page of how this sucks but they

411
00:13:37,055 --> 00:13:39,395
were like filming like we're here we're

412
00:13:39,395 --> 00:13:40,835
working i couldn't believe it i know

413
00:13:40,835 --> 00:13:41,435
that everyone does

414
00:13:41,435 --> 00:13:43,025
that on their stories but i've never

415
00:13:43,025 --> 00:13:45,575
really watched someone go into it when

416
00:13:45,575 --> 00:13:47,675
it's like you're in an environment where

417
00:13:47,675 --> 00:13:49,775
this is unnatural yeah you've seen the

418
00:13:49,775 --> 00:13:51,455
result of it yes yeah are they

419
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:53,705
all lifestyle influencers they might as well

420
00:13:53,825 --> 00:13:55,415
be my style brand or whatever they

421
00:13:55,535 --> 00:13:57,440
trying to yeah that's what i got

422
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,805
i thought they were like one girl

423
00:13:58,805 --> 00:14:00,155
just got her mba so i was

424
00:14:00,155 --> 00:14:01,415
like this she's doing something

425
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:03,695
but like but she was filming herself

426
00:14:03,755 --> 00:14:05,105
working out in the mirror and i

427
00:14:05,105 --> 00:14:06,785
was like why so then they're doing

428
00:14:06,785 --> 00:14:07,685
that and then i'm definitely in the

429
00:14:07,685 --> 00:14:09,665
background like grumble at a w n

430
00:14:09,665 --> 00:14:11,915
b a w m b o i

431
00:14:11,915 --> 00:14:13,385
said to you mba oh you did

432
00:14:13,385 --> 00:14:14,874
i thought yeah because i said nva

433
00:14:15,515 --> 00:14:17,345
correctly the letters are so no i

434
00:14:17,345 --> 00:14:19,355
didn't scott didn't correct anyone the listener

435
00:14:19,355 --> 00:14:21,185
i'm just telling you this i'm choosing

436
00:14:21,185 --> 00:14:21,755
you i'm just saying

437
00:14:21,785 --> 00:14:23,285
just your accusing me i don't like

438
00:14:23,285 --> 00:14:24,125
it i'm sure i was like

439
00:14:25,355 --> 00:14:26,495
i'm accusing you of being late

440
00:14:27,635 --> 00:14:29,705
um okay and then they're filming me

441
00:14:29,855 --> 00:14:31,805
i'm not therefore not filming no good

442
00:14:31,805 --> 00:14:33,635
purpose but i'm definitely being caught in

443
00:14:33,695 --> 00:14:36,575
batches small space and i'm not happy

444
00:14:36,575 --> 00:14:38,435
looking so you're like a background artist

445
00:14:38,465 --> 00:14:40,835
i did great background work and then

446
00:14:41,435 --> 00:14:43,175
they were doing the class then this

447
00:14:43,235 --> 00:14:45,095
woman starts filming herself in these big

448
00:14:45,095 --> 00:14:46,445
mirrors they have that are definitely like

449
00:14:46,505 --> 00:14:47,525
i kept hitting my foot on there

450
00:14:47,705 --> 00:14:48,755
like first of all there's another thing

451
00:14:48,905 --> 00:14:50,705
i'm too tar was so big you

452
00:14:50,735 --> 00:14:52,262
kept hitting you it was an angle

453
00:14:52,297 --> 00:14:54,275
it was like a gold framed mirror

454
00:14:54,275 --> 00:14:55,745
at an angle leaned against the wall

455
00:14:55,745 --> 00:14:57,035
and my machine was really close to

456
00:14:57,035 --> 00:14:58,985
it and i'm tall which is also

457
00:14:59,015 --> 00:15:00,545
they should have been taking into consideration

458
00:15:00,545 --> 00:15:01,715
when they placed me there like it

459
00:15:01,715 --> 00:15:02,435
was a whole thing

460
00:15:03,575 --> 00:15:04,655
and i was too tall for the

461
00:15:04,655 --> 00:15:06,245
machine which i've gone to many parties

462
00:15:06,245 --> 00:15:07,625
classes and they will give you extends

463
00:15:07,625 --> 00:15:08,675
and like different things that make the

464
00:15:08,675 --> 00:15:10,209
machine work for you oh really yeah

465
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:12,455
i'm just but i kept not being

466
00:15:12,455 --> 00:15:13,325
able to do things and the woman

467
00:15:13,325 --> 00:15:14,525
like thought i was not capable and

468
00:15:14,525 --> 00:15:15,636
i was like i'm too tall and

469
00:15:15,636 --> 00:15:16,895
then she would be like not just

470
00:15:16,895 --> 00:15:18,695
lean forward and i know my legs

471
00:15:18,695 --> 00:15:20,285
can't go further whatever the teacher was

472
00:15:20,285 --> 00:15:22,445
horrible then the woman starts filling yourself

473
00:15:22,445 --> 00:15:23,675
in the mirror and the teach

474
00:15:23,675 --> 00:15:24,785

easier that way i'll just like shoot

477
00:15:27,335 --> 00:15:28,265

478
00:15:28,265 --> 00:15:30,365
takes the phone goes and one two

479
00:15:30,395 --> 00:15:31,805

class while filming filming somewhat everyone yeah

481
00:15:34,955 --> 00:15:37,595
this woman's story or whatever this doesn't

482
00:15:37,595 --> 00:15:39,425

wow that was totally unnatural or like

516
00:16:39,845 --> 00:16:41,105
it just came out of nowhere i

517
00:16:41,105 --> 00:16:42,515
have and i am surprised that i

518
00:16:42,515 --> 00:16:44,075
haven't actually i mean i've seen people

519
00:16:44,075 --> 00:16:45,635
taking selfies and stuff but i haven't

520
00:16:45,635 --> 00:16:49,325
seen anyone narrating themselves in that way

00:16:49,385 --> 00:16:51,155
yeah and the y yeah yeah i

522
00:16:51,155 --> 00:16:52,865

and the person behind you if you're

524
00:16:55,475 --> 00:16:57,485

the person next year whatever is just

526
00:16:59,075 --> 00:17:01,175

527
00:17:01,175 --> 00:17:02,705
they get selfie face and they start

528
00:17:02,705 --> 00:17:04,776
going oh yeah he wants we'll take

about them and we feel really yuck

537
00:17:21,815 --> 00:17:23,645
and then i also had a moment

538
00:17:24,545 --> 00:17:25,805
the other day where this was like

539
00:17:25,805 --> 00:17:26,945
a positive version of it where i

540
00:17:26,945 --> 00:17:28,925
was driving up beachwood canyon where they

541
00:17:28,955 --> 00:17:29,645
you could see the hollywood

542
00:17:29,705 --> 00:17:30,395
i'm really well on a lot of

543
00:17:30,395 --> 00:17:32,435
people take photos there it's filled with

544
00:17:32,435 --> 00:17:34,925
people thinking you can get to the

545
00:17:34,925 --> 00:17:36,605
hollywood sign from there so it's so

546
00:17:36,605 --> 00:17:38,255
if you're walking along that street

547
00:17:39,455 --> 00:17:42,006
tourists of various countries are constantly stopping

548
00:17:42,049 --> 00:17:43,565

00:17:45,155 --> 00:17:46,865
and it doesn't go directly to that

551
00:17:47,255 --> 00:17:49,685
but they i started crying because i

552
00:17:49,685 --> 00:17:51,155
was so happy for all these people

553
00:17:51,155 --> 00:17:52,904

of whether it was about the movie

653
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:10,420
yesterday

654
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:12,280
oh yeah okay oh lord did you

655
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:13,690
take your headphones off for yeah take

656
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:16,540
your headphones off i haven't seen the

657
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:19,090
movie yesterday oh okay but you know

658
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:20,800
when i say hi but i know

659
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:24,400
when did you see it yesterday i

660
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,770
feel like i know the synopsis of

661
00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:28,990
the film yeah and what the story

662
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:30,400
that she told i don't think

663
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:32,860
lyons lines up exactly into one with

664
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:34,240
the movie there were some words that

665
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,400
were very similar she used the for

666
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,500
sure she used a those have to

667
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,600
be in the movie yeah so somewhere

668
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,910
in the trailer i think that part

669
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:44,260
of her story was definitely about the

670
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:46,210
movie where she said nah she's sunni

671
00:21:46,239 --> 00:21:48,040
and i think it's i think it's

672
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,840
ah you know i think she dipped

673
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:50,770
in and out though because then

674
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,030
she would follow it up by saying

675
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:53,830
like jim and i don't think there

676
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:55,030
was a gym in the movie i

677
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:56,650
think it's parallel thinking that other stuff

678
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:59,080
i don't know he never wrote it

679
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,190
seemed like a rip off to me

680
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:01,810
it seemed like she was wow she

681
00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:03,310
was we might have a hung jury

682
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:03,550
here

683
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,790
you know you see i'm gonna say

684
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:10,690
whip em out

685
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:15,280
imo whip em i'm gonna say hello

686
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:16,720
my name is whip em i was

687
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,880
gonna say that her story was not

688
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,750
about the movie yesterday

689
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:22,690
this is a tough one for me

690
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:25,000
because i've seen the movie

691
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:29,020
ah i watched every single minute of

692
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:30,430
it and i never dipped out to

693
00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:33,790
go pee so i know pretty much

694
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:35,530
i could answer any question that you

695
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:37,900
have about the movie zero oil detail

696
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:40,270
you have zero questions good that works

697
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:44,320
out great but um i think that

698
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,180
when i saw

699
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:48,700
the movie it was about everything that

700
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:51,029
she talked about so yeah ok what

701
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:52,990
you're saying the movie was about her

702
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:55,750
story she was in it too but

703
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:57,670
you're not but but that's different than

704
00:22:57,670 --> 00:22:59,020
her story being about the movie you

705
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:01,870
see yeah and come to think of

706
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:04,300
it i actually was just following her

707
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:06,370
around and watching her i don't see

708
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,240
a movie i think that's what you're

709
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:09,520
thinking yeah yeah guys guys hi are

00:39:10,105 --> 00:39:12,235
once yeah it was a story about

1156
00:39:12,235 --> 00:39:15,895

00:39:15,985 --> 00:39:17,665
that he was gonna do three um

1158
00:39:17,695 --> 00:39:20,305
three installments of and the first one

1159
00:39:20,305 --> 00:39:21,385
was about any notch

1160
00:39:23,515 --> 00:39:25,015
the first one was about his childhood

1161
00:39:25,465 --> 00:39:26,305
and when that came out i was

1162
00:39:26,305 --> 00:39:28,075
still living in philly and i went

1163
00:39:28,645 --> 00:39:31,105
instead of a long line to meet

1164
00:39:31,105 --> 00:39:32,215
him and have him sign the book

1165
00:39:32,365 --> 00:39:32,965
and

1166
00:39:34,195 --> 00:39:36,145
ah you know like after about ten

1167
00:39:36,145 --> 00:39:39,055
minutes they you know the bookstore people

1168
00:39:39,055 --> 00:39:41,485
came to tell everyone online he's getting

1169
00:39:41,485 --> 00:39:42,415
tired so he's not going to have

1170
00:39:42,445 --> 00:39:44,065
time to personalize all the books i

1171
00:39:44,065 --> 00:39:45,235
was like i gotta get this god

1172
00:39:45,259 --> 00:39:47,815
person with my fucking book yeah so

1173
00:39:47,845 --> 00:39:49,345
i at the time would occasionally do

1174
00:39:49,345 --> 00:39:52,165
an impression of him on stage ah

1175
00:39:52,225 --> 00:39:54,325
if my closer did not get

1176
00:39:54,355 --> 00:39:56,067
a laugh that i would do this

1177
00:39:56,067 --> 00:39:57,565
oppression because it was a big shouty

1178
00:39:57,565 --> 00:39:59,395
thing and it would oh yeah things

1179
00:39:59,395 --> 00:40:00,985
like anything where you shout or do

1180
00:40:00,985 --> 00:40:04,795
a pie or oh yeah exactly so

1181
00:40:04,825 --> 00:40:05,995
i wanted to get him it was

1182
00:40:05,995 --> 00:40:08,995
the impression was him reciting the itsy

1183
00:40:08,995 --> 00:40:10,195
bitsy spider and so i was like

1184
00:40:10,195 --> 00:40:11,185
i have to get part of that

1185
00:40:11,395 --> 00:40:12,415
have to get him right some of

1186
00:40:12,415 --> 00:40:13,705
that in this book

1187
00:40:14,695 --> 00:40:16,405
and so when i got up to

1188
00:40:16,405 --> 00:40:17,275
him in the line

1189
00:40:18,895 --> 00:40:21,535
i lied and said my father used

1190
00:40:21,535 --> 00:40:22,705
to do an impression of him he's

1191
00:40:22,735 --> 00:40:24,295
passed away but we were kids used

1192
00:40:24,295 --> 00:40:26,545
to do this pressure that always wow

1193
00:40:26,875 --> 00:40:28,705
and so he signed part of a

1194
00:40:28,705 --> 00:40:31,285
side like up comes the sun wow

1195
00:40:31,285 --> 00:40:33,625
alumni zion the best part to pick

1196
00:40:33,625 --> 00:40:35,935
that that was also the loudest part

1197
00:40:36,085 --> 00:40:38,395
oh wow impression assad up

1198
00:40:39,635 --> 00:40:42,365

1199
00:40:42,365 --> 00:40:45,485
yeah yeah absolutely and then it got

1200
00:40:45,485 --> 00:40:47,915

dead celebrities and from your conversation you

1299
00:44:17,165 --> 00:44:18,545
have to figure out who you are

1300
00:44:18,575 --> 00:44:20,765
without asking direct questions each of us

1301
00:44:20,795 --> 00:44:22,265
not you the listener yeah although you're

1302
00:44:22,265 --> 00:44:23,975

1306
00:44:28,778 --> 00:44:29,885
if we are and we talk to

1307
00:44:29,885 --> 00:44:30,245

1309
00:44:31,565 --> 00:44:33,785
ever figure it out we say oh

1310
00:44:34,025 --> 00:44:35,525
this is a twist i thought that's

1311
00:44:35,525 --> 00:44:37,055
how i understood it so so what

1312
00:44:37,055 --> 00:44:38,915
