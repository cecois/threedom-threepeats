145
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:35,190
on a phone in a scene where

146
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:36,510
it's takes place in the eighties and

147
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:38,160
i was aged eighty phone see i

148
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,600
was taping on i was typing my

149
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,940
number and i did a number that

150
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:43,260
israel do you do that when you

151
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:43,440

152
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,790

153
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:46,410
j gibb or if i have to

154
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:48,510
type something all gibberish if i've to

155
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:50,250
dial a number all gibberish because i

156
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,260
don't want anyone like slowing down the

157
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:54,300
frame and figuring out like a real

158
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,580
yeah i dread having to do any

159
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:57,660
scenes where i have to type because

160
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:59,130
i'm such a terrible typist and people

161
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:00,240
will know that i'm not typing

162
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:02,820
i once was because if i type

163
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,170
the way i actually type you'd be

164
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:05,760

169
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,340

yeah just remember they will do anything

247
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:02,160
to go viral crest is a ruthless

248
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,980
toothpaste company guys did you have in

249
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:06,690
halloween did you have the local dentist

250
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:07,440
who would give you crap

251
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,238
yes in halloween we held in a

252
00:09:09,238 --> 00:09:09,630
hell

253
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,180
like there was a dentist who lived

254
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:13,890
on your street yeah not on the

255
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:17,160
next street over who basically like you

256
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,720
would just go you would approach it

257
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,830
and kids would be coming back going

258
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:21,540
like don't bother because it would just

259
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:23,790
be like a toothbrush and some crest

260
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:25,560
and a lot of free toothbrush huh

261
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,930
i actually don't mind that because kids

262
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:30,420
are i understand the momentary disappointment kids

263
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:30,930
are getting

264
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:32,580
but i think it's i think it's

265
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:34,170
okay to give them a little reminder

266
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:36,870
ah fuck without eye candy i don't

267
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:38,370
really think it's okay you think it's

268
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:41,250
okay together where reminder i watched you

269
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:42,900
slip him a business card so get

270
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,160
lost you know what i mean like

271
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,210
the kids aren't going to be the

272
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:47,280
kids will forget it instantly you know

273
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:49,470
such a bigger initial outrage was a

274
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:51,120
moment of stuff having fun

275
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,670
on kids yeah you go all in

276
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:55,140
or don't go or don't i guess

277
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:56,730
it's sort of like memento mori kind

278
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:58,710
of thing like remember youtube shall get

279
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:00,780

559
00:19:41,545 --> 00:19:43,015
percent of it i loved it i

560
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:44,335

561
00:19:44,335 --> 00:19:46,405
guess i'm a real dump mister magoo

562
00:19:47,155 --> 00:19:48,955
yeah i liked it would you describe

563
00:19:48,955 --> 00:19:51,355
her as somebody who wears glasses no

564
00:19:51,865 --> 00:19:53,485
why is that because she's a woman

565
00:19:53,575 --> 00:19:54,595
yeah women don't

566
00:19:56,575 --> 00:19:57,654

567
00:19:57,654 --> 00:19:58,375
them that often

568
00:19:59,427 --> 00:20:02,425

741
00:25:57,345 --> 00:25:58,875
responsibility to make sure that you have

749
00:26:13,215 --> 00:26:14,745
about the concept of a last meal

750
00:26:14,805 --> 00:26:16,935
to her referencing something person was being

751
00:26:16,965 --> 00:26:18,705
executed was given a last meal yeah

752
00:26:18,885 --> 00:26:20,295
what their last meal was and it's

753
00:26:20,295 --> 00:26:21,585
like did we talk about last meals

754
00:26:21,585 --> 00:26:23,006
on this yeah i think so but

00:26:23,006 --> 00:26:24,315
ah we talked about what we would

756
00:26:24,315 --> 00:26:26,265

757
00:26:26,265 --> 00:26:28,365
would you eat it's such a depressing

758
00:26:28,995 --> 00:26:30,705
whenever i think about it now i

759
00:26:30,705 --> 00:26:31,545

00:26:34,155 --> 00:26:35,387
because you know things good enough do

763
00:26:35,387 --> 00:26:36,555
you not want to know what your

764
00:26:36,555 --> 00:26:37,425
last meal is

765
00:26:38,505 --> 00:26:40,005
that that should be on people's death

766
00:26:40,005 --> 00:26:41,775
certificate what their last meal was no

767
00:26:41,775 --> 00:26:43,180

a into a computer but it's such

830
00:28:35,745 --> 00:28:37,485
an old computer at that point that

if i'm my consciousness jandy co they

839
00:28:54,495 --> 00:28:56,145
figured they figured out a way to

840
00:28:56,175 --> 00:28:57,435
digitize meals

841
00:28:58,335 --> 00:28:59,475
candy coated rain job

842
00:29:00,825 --> 00:29:02,175
they figured out a way to digitize

843
00:29:02,175 --> 00:29:04,005
meals so you find steed you finally

844
00:29:04,005 --> 00:29:05,445
say i want out of this computer

845
00:29:05,475 --> 00:29:07,485
and you eat the digital meal and

846
00:29:07,485 --> 00:29:09,885
then god comes down and says when

847
00:29:09,885 --> 00:29:11,445
you eat the digital meals like this

848
00:29:11,805 --> 00:29:14,115
people hoping oh no i didn't buy

849
00:29:14,775 --> 00:29:16,125
all those ones here i come down

850
00:29:16,125 --> 00:29:18,495
says now you never need to eat

851
00:29:18,495 --> 00:29:19,755
again i wasn't going to kill you

852
00:29:19,785 --> 00:29:20,655
you just never need to

853
00:29:20,685 --> 00:29:22,155
eat again you could have eaten that

854
00:29:22,155 --> 00:29:23,505
at any point in your life i

855
00:29:23,505 --> 00:29:24,945
would say this is less sexy

856
00:29:26,265 --> 00:29:28,305
i like eating yeah

857
00:29:29,385 --> 00:29:30,795
that's the reason why when you tell

858
00:29:30,795 --> 00:29:32,835
me that that's the point though that's

859
00:29:32,835 --> 00:29:35,505
the parable that is what okay so

860
00:29:36,525 --> 00:29:38,325
god comes down and gives me very

861
00:29:38,325 --> 00:29:40,785
little information yeah but gives me misleading

862
00:29:40,785 --> 00:29:42,855
information for sure yes it's like a

863
00:29:42,855 --> 00:29:44,445
trick and the parable is what was

864
00:29:44,445 --> 00:29:46,215
the what should i have done trust

865
00:29:46,215 --> 00:29:49,095
god above all else

866
00:29:50,235 --> 00:29:51,975
so so god was just saying if

867
00:29:51,975 --> 00:29:53,385
you eat this you never need to

868
00:29:53,385 --> 00:29:56,085
eat again that that's what he that's

869
00:29:56,085 --> 00:29:57,165
what he was going to say if

870
00:29:57,165 --> 00:29:58,305
you had taken him up on his

871
00:29:58,305 --> 00:30:00,615
offer what i mean his offer his

872
00:30:00,615 --> 00:30:02,055
offer to for you to eat this

873
00:30:02,055 --> 00:30:03,315
i thought he was just telling me

874
00:30:03,315 --> 00:30:05,143
that well that's your problem you didn't

875
00:30:05,143 --> 00:30:07,455
trust god and communicating with him well

876
00:30:07,515 --> 00:30:10,125
that's the point way he's gonna be

877
00:30:10,125 --> 00:30:10,335
okay

878
00:30:10,755 --> 00:30:13,005
well that's impossible do you think this

879
00:30:13,005 --> 00:30:15,225
because he's god yeah very convenient do

880
00:30:15,225 --> 00:30:16,365
you think this terrible will be taught

881
00:30:16,365 --> 00:30:17,805
in seminary yeah for sure

00:36:43,790 --> 00:36:43,940
wrap

1063
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:46,280

is is like four inches by four

1071
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:04,550

00:37:16,070 --> 00:37:18,860
that is a heavy statement just that

1077
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:20,180
every idea you have is already an

1078
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:21,590
idea but you know what you could

1079
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,660
they can't copyright that you could create

1080
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:25,250

00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:10,190
game and i

1107
00:38:10,490 --> 00:38:13,160
creased that card in candyland the princess

1108
00:38:13,199 --> 00:38:15,530
you would get it yeah you little

1109
00:38:15,530 --> 00:38:18,200
cheat sheet and i also crease maria

1110
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,460
and guess who because she was the

1111
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:19,970
pretty one

1112
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:27,590
dora taya electoral loren lapis reversing lounger

1113
00:38:27,590 --> 00:38:31,250
think our spending typically reverse

1114
00:38:32,690 --> 00:38:34,130
so you would cheat at games and

1115
00:38:34,130 --> 00:38:35,630
you're young just trying to get the

1116
00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:38,054
good card it wasn't really cheating like

1117
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:39,350
and guess who like you could be

1118
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:40,880
the same person every time you're only

1119
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:42,497
tricking though you know the other person

1120
00:38:42,502 --> 00:38:43,520
still so guess

1121
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:46,280
so guess who is the game where

1122
00:38:46,310 --> 00:38:47,270
yeah i don't know it's a bunch

1123
00:38:47,270 --> 00:38:48,770
of different faces and you have to

1124
00:38:48,770 --> 00:38:51,710
say is your personal glasses flipped down

1125
00:38:51,710 --> 00:38:53,420
every person in his classes she only

1126
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:55,490
have ten did people catch on that

1127
00:38:55,490 --> 00:38:57,500
you were always the same person people

1128
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:58,760
would be like my brother and you

1129
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:01,340
probably are using dss again or whatever

1130
00:39:01,370 --> 00:39:03,920
yeah exactly um ah what is the

1131
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:04,790
game where you have to

1132
00:39:04,850 --> 00:39:08,810
match the people ah tinder what do

1133
00:39:08,810 --> 00:39:11,600
you mean match you have to ah

1134
00:39:11,615 --> 00:39:13,100
yeah it's like a memory game so

1135
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:14,180
you see like a guy with a

1136
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:15,710
beard and glasses and then you have

1137
00:39:15,710 --> 00:39:17,900
to find him again somewhere else yeah

1138
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,190
i don't know that game

1139
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:22,010
i don't know it's official name but

1140
00:39:22,010 --> 00:39:23,954
it's i'm at astounded by this power

1141
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:25,100
account it looks humongous let me see

1142
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:26,330
how big this is well that okay

1143
00:39:26,330 --> 00:39:27,800
so my my addition to it is

1144
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,240
each square is bigger so that you

1145
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:33,080
can pop twenty things yeah now this

1146
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:34,010
is a big calendar

1147
00:39:35,090 --> 00:39:36,800
i mean do you like the idea

1148
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,330
though yeah i love it i son

1149
00:39:38,330 --> 00:39:39,950
was so excited about his twenty twenty

1150
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:41,120
calendar and that he is going to

1151
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:43,430
pop the dates each day so he

1152
00:39:43,430 --> 00:39:46,040
doesn't have to achieve anything yeah it's

1153
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:48,140
just purely a like okay so mad

1154
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:49,970
about kids says great idea for bubble

1155
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:52,010
poppers are those who rely on touch

1156
00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:54,770
you know idea for bubble poppers a

1157
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:55,100
bubble

1158
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:58,160
shoppers might say that's no moon for

1159
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,870
ten fun i mean it's more about

1160
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:01,857
i had this idea i could be

1161
00:40:01,857 --> 00:40:04,010
getting you you would gild the lily

1162
00:40:04,010 --> 00:40:05,180

need that i still say that now

1165
00:40:09,830 --> 00:40:11,450
doesn't i see that now when you

1166
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:12,530
were a kid would you get a

1167
00:40:12,530 --> 00:40:14,030

and everyone's gonna day-by-day calendar too and

1171
00:40:18,108 --> 00:40:19,400

1173
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:23,060

1175
00:40:24,890 --> 00:40:27,324
got them in like high school it

1176
00:40:27,324 --> 00:40:28,610
would be like war today or something

1177
00:40:28,610 --> 00:40:30,920
like that okay yeah whatever data yeah

1178
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:32,720
but sometimes i would let it go

1179
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:33,830
for a few months then you rip

1180
00:40:33,830 --> 00:40:35,540
off a big thick gummy chung

1181
00:40:36,125 --> 00:40:38,045
yeah and that's fun too well i

1182
00:40:38,045 --> 00:40:39,515
mean when we would go away to

1183
00:40:39,515 --> 00:40:41,703
like our european home of course see

1184
00:40:41,703 --> 00:40:44,135
back for three months yes and then

1185
00:40:44,225 --> 00:40:45,665
to dribble three months at a time

1186
00:40:45,665 --> 00:40:48,395
as what about luggage turns into calendar

1187
00:40:48,965 --> 00:40:51,395
perfect if it's notable rap calendar i

1188
00:40:51,395 --> 00:40:54,695

follow reblog

1190
00:40:56,521 --> 00:40:58,175
this is perfect fun for people who

1191
00:40:58,175 --> 00:41:00,365
work in the airport because they can

1192
00:41:00,365 --> 00:41:02,525
throw it in it pops yeah that

1193
00:41:02,525 --> 00:41:04,295
would be so they'd be like throwing

1194
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:06,076
the luggage suddenly go pat pat pat

1195
00:41:06,095 --> 00:41:07,565
and you wouldn't mind that they throw

1196
00:41:07,565 --> 00:41:09,845
your luggage you can be protected when

1197
00:41:09,845 --> 00:41:11,225
you see that out the window it's

1198
00:41:11,285 --> 00:41:12,965
wild it's going to do they're just

1199
00:41:13,115 --> 00:41:14,645
awesome that shit and they're like oh

1200
00:41:14,675 --> 00:41:15,695
if you had to do that job

1201
00:41:15,695 --> 00:41:16,336
that's what you would do

1202
00:41:16,625 --> 00:41:18,485
yeah and i like gatto fully one

1203
00:41:18,515 --> 00:41:20,495
hundred percent yeah one of the things

1204
00:41:20,495 --> 00:41:21,905
you'll ever make it like a machine

1205
00:41:21,905 --> 00:41:24,095
that just like lifts lifts hopefully hopefully

1206
00:41:24,155 --> 00:41:25,805
every job will be illimitable you know

1207
00:41:25,835 --> 00:41:27,245
what i think yup they need to

1208
00:41:27,245 --> 00:41:29,345
store wheelchairs more safely i've seen many

1209
00:41:29,345 --> 00:41:31,205
stories of leaves were too yeah she's

1210
00:41:31,415 --> 00:41:33,665
ruining yeah yeah chairs mean people are

1211
00:41:33,665 --> 00:41:35,315
stuck because you don't have a mode

1212
00:41:35,315 --> 00:41:36,605
of transportation it's thirteen fucked

1213
00:41:36,875 --> 00:41:38,465
bananas that they would do that yeah

1214
00:41:38,525 --> 00:41:39,815
why do they take care of them

1215
00:41:39,815 --> 00:41:42,065
so poorly i don't know like they

1216
00:41:42,065 --> 00:41:43,205
know what they're doing i'm sure they're

1217
00:41:43,205 --> 00:41:44,885
under some pressure to get things done

1218
00:41:44,915 --> 00:41:45,785
quickly and they're like a way to

1219
00:41:45,785 --> 00:41:47,615
strap it into its doesn't not knocking

1220
00:41:47,615 --> 00:41:48,725
around all over the place and it's

1221
00:41:48,725 --> 00:41:50,885
probably it is probably like an amazon

1222
00:41:50,885 --> 00:41:52,565
thing where they're like under quota or

1223
00:41:52,565 --> 00:41:54,335
like a time thing or it's awful

1224
00:41:54,485 --> 00:41:56,075
yeah i mean it's not everything is

1225
00:41:56,075 --> 00:41:56,765
like determine

1226
00:41:56,765 --> 00:41:57,875
lol wherever one who works at an

1227
00:41:57,875 --> 00:42:00,125
airport is jolly and wonderful to each

1228
00:42:00,125 --> 00:42:02,135
other i'm sure it's like if you

1229
00:42:02,135 --> 00:42:03,065
had to live at an airport which

1230
00:42:03,065 --> 00:42:04,895
ones you pick this is a good

1231
00:42:04,895 --> 00:42:07,115
question here's the phyllis

1232
00:42:12,828 --> 00:42:15,425
i picked the hawaii airport john wayne

1233
00:42:16,505 --> 00:42:17,855
you'd pick hawaii look out and see

1234
00:42:17,855 --> 00:42:20,795
hawaii yeah plus it's it's very chill

1235
00:42:20,825 --> 00:42:22,055
if you had told that little one

1236
00:42:22,055 --> 00:42:24,455
that's like sm yeah yeah yeah you

1237
00:42:24,455 --> 00:42:26,015
know that one yeah it's like outdoorsy

1238
00:42:26,015 --> 00:42:27,875
and yeah nice yeah like the kawaii

1239
00:42:27,902 --> 00:42:30,005
airport yeah i picked that one yeah

1240
00:42:30,215 --> 00:42:31,385
i mean if i had to live

1241
00:42:31,385 --> 00:42:32,795
one ran and maybe it would rain

1242
00:42:32,795 --> 00:42:34,415
too much in the in our immediate

1243
00:42:34,415 --> 00:42:35,705
area i guess i would have to

1244
00:42:35,705 --> 00:42:36,605
choose l a x if

1245
00:42:36,605 --> 00:42:38,015
i'm just living there's a lot of

1246
00:42:38,015 --> 00:42:40,715
restaurants like choose the genre so terminal

1247
00:42:40,745 --> 00:42:43,265
i gotta go what about j f

1248
00:42:43,265 --> 00:42:45,845
k though like that giant part of

1249
00:42:45,845 --> 00:42:47,075
j f k i do like the

1250
00:42:47,225 --> 00:42:48,785
j f k has a shake shack

1251
00:42:48,845 --> 00:42:50,165
as to shake shack yeah but you

1252
00:42:50,195 --> 00:42:52,367
die only in the delta place you

1253
00:42:52,445 --> 00:42:53,345
get sick of that soon

1254
00:42:54,575 --> 00:42:56,705
don't fall i wouldn't eat them every

1255
00:42:56,705 --> 00:42:58,055
day but i like it as an

1256
00:42:58,055 --> 00:43:00,365
option all right you're right she said

1257
00:43:00,365 --> 00:43:01,745
it would be a hurry it would

1258
00:43:01,745 --> 00:43:02,765
be trying to control my life in

1259
00:43:02,765 --> 00:43:05,135
the alpha and delta swarovski crystals every

1260
00:43:05,135 --> 00:43:05,435
day

1261
00:43:08,105 --> 00:43:09,575
i'd probably go to that bobby van's

1262
00:43:09,575 --> 00:43:12,515
restaurant would probably be difficult to eat

1263
00:43:12,515 --> 00:43:13,655
healthy if you had to live in

1264
00:43:13,655 --> 00:43:15,395
an airport wouldn't yeah you don't like

1265
00:43:15,395 --> 00:43:16,835
jersey mike's you would but i mean

1266
00:43:16,835 --> 00:43:18,335
you're likely to show so why not

1267
00:43:18,395 --> 00:43:19,985
live it up you'd probably figure out

1268
00:43:19,985 --> 00:43:21,215
a way to do it though i'll

1269
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:24,095
be so drunk i would be just

1270
00:43:24,095 --> 00:43:26,015
like a fan if you weren't a

1271
00:43:26,015 --> 00:43:26,765
mess if you

1272
00:43:26,807 --> 00:43:28,475
work at the airport and then you

1273
00:43:28,475 --> 00:43:29,465
have to eat lunch the airport it's

1274
00:43:29,465 --> 00:43:32,135
so expensive that's unfair that's why you

1275
00:43:32,135 --> 00:43:33,455
brown bag it i mean i would

1276
00:43:33,455 --> 00:43:35,645
imagine people get discounts i should hope

1277
00:43:35,645 --> 00:43:37,205
so or bring their their lunch from

1278
00:43:37,205 --> 00:43:39,065
home but that's more their wife comes

1279
00:43:39,065 --> 00:43:40,355
and drops it off for them

1280
00:43:41,435 --> 00:43:44,105
holy and you forgot this and all

1281
00:43:44,105 --> 00:43:45,725
these play or they work at the

1282
00:43:45,725 --> 00:43:47,315
restaurant they just eat it off the

1283
00:43:47,375 --> 00:43:49,505
out of the troughs yeah yeah awesome

1284
00:43:49,535 --> 00:43:51,935

1558
00:53:52,060 --> 00:53:53,740
is all stuff was ok

1559
00:53:55,150 --> 00:53:57,670
hear what happened to you i don't

1560
00:53:57,670 --> 00:53:59,740
know so this is all stuff that

1561
00:53:59,740 --> 00:54:03,397
would be sold during medieval times doesn't

1562
00:54:03,397 --> 00:54:05,350
so i think it is actually i

1563
00:54:05,350 --> 00:54:07,840
don't know i mean certainly some things

1564
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:09,550
you could buy like but i think

1565
00:54:09,550 --> 00:54:10,900
both of these things are things that

1566
00:54:10,900 --> 00:54:12,760
you could buy well the customer's always

1567
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:14,950
right so i don't know this guy

1568
00:54:15,010 --> 00:54:16,633
this definitely fits what do you think

1569
00:54:16,870 --> 00:54:18,400
buddies like what i have what do

1570
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:20,050
you like wow yeah but what yeah

1571
00:54:20,050 --> 00:54:21,850
what i think what you have is

1572
00:54:21,910 --> 00:54:23,620
i i feel like i've seen something

1573
00:54:23,620 --> 00:54:26,200
like this before is yeah some cause

1574
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:28,600
it's famous ah no it's definitely not

1575
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:30,790
famous but i just i i used

1576
00:54:30,790 --> 00:54:32,107
to work at a swap meet at

1577
00:54:32,107 --> 00:54:33,190
like a flea market and

1578
00:54:34,390 --> 00:54:36,790

sir yes is incredible that a circular

1581
00:54:42,492 --> 00:54:44,590
light is so large like well it's

1582
00:54:44,590 --> 00:54:46,060
logic of course the price is a

1583
00:54:46,060 --> 00:54:47,830
little bit high because of the size

1584
00:54:48,490 --> 00:54:49,810
i understand that if it were smaller

1585
00:54:49,810 --> 00:54:51,430
it would definitely be less yes but

1586
00:54:51,910 --> 00:54:53,890
i would just like what does that

1587
00:54:54,970 --> 00:54:56,470
just said oder what do you mean

1588
00:54:57,040 --> 00:54:58,630
