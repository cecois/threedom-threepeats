78
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:05,730
brand disney branded earbuds

79
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:07,350
that i gave to my are they

83
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:14,400
had mickey mouse on the on the

84
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,380
the case i like it on the

85
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:18,390
case but there must have been something

86
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:19,740
else in there and perhaps it was

87
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,651
an edible or drinkable thing yeah because

88
00:03:22,651 --> 00:03:24,570
that would not have making me weak

89
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,140
edibles this is what disney came up

90
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:29,700
with all this shit hey there was

91
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,620
a brick of hash there have i

92
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:33,030
already mentioned this to you that i

93
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:36,090
was watching the imagineers show on disney

94
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,250
plus i feel like i've seen some

95
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:39,540
of that was saying it's all i've

96
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:41,460
seen you mention that to me ah

97
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:43,650
disney made up the whole disney thing

98
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:45,300
but one thing that i always think

99
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:45,840
is so fat

100
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,490
fascinating when i learned about disney which

101
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:50,100
i do all the time is it's

102
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,810
a constant quest for now because there's

103
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:53,190
always so much you can never know

104
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:55,830
everything like oh i want to know

105
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:58,380
what what kind of guts it takes

106
00:03:58,530 --> 00:03:59,846
like if you made a theme parking

107
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:02,974
just say called otterman i know yesterday

108
00:04:02,974 --> 00:04:05,040
it is crazy because as long as

109
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:05,790
i've been alive

110
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:08,340
the the name disney is just a

111
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:09,810
brand yeah yeah i know he's a

112
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:11,220
guy but it's like yeah one of

113
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:12,960
the most famous prevents but hard to

114
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,580
reverse that and just go yeah that

115
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:16,020
was a man's like i've just calling

116
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:18,120
i open the same locker on laccase

117
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:21,690
it's just kiss land i think like

118
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:23,580
no one has done is go down

119
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:24,930
to laugh because oh hey going on

120
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:25,140
now

121
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,900
just like the best comedians

122
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:31,920
though the one of the best guys

123
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,150
who should have been a cast member

124
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:35,310
should have been okay honestly seems to

125
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:36,660
have hosts who are good enough to

126
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:37,380
be in it

127
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:41,970
only occasionally he's like just fitch's fault

128
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:43,620
of the child i loved to talk

129
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:45,780
about some other things that have happened

130
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:48,510
on the show boyer your yearning are

131
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:50,610
you going to her no no okay

132
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,810
but i will say it feels like

133
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:53,580
what the coven restrict i'm guessing it's

134
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:55,500
covered restrictions they're barely putting people the

135
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,700

00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:38,760
and your dick needs to do something

189
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:39,690
eighty percent

190
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:43,111
he's like oh no here it comes

191
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:45,390
there's no situation you're like i gotta

192
00:06:45,472 --> 00:06:47,220
take my pants off while i'm doing

193
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:48,660
the zoom even if it's some long

194
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:50,670
thing maybe maybe this is how you've

195
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:52,800
been resolved by now but the first

196
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,940
thing i thought of is is that

197
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:55,440
there was like a sexy anchor who

198
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,090
was on that he was like all

199
00:06:57,090 --> 00:06:59,220
manage to me on track like it

200
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:00,810
was like this using camera

201
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,790
on and he doesn't you think it

202
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:04,890
was intentional that's why they that's my

203
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:06,570
way maybe it's all out in the

204
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:07,740
open now i just think it's hard

205
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:09,810
for that to be an excellent i

206
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:10,620
could see it if he met he

207
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:11,911
was just looking at something else on

208
00:07:11,911 --> 00:07:13,886

348
00:12:18,525 --> 00:12:20,535
wing a lot of sweat pants but

what i mean but look under it

352
00:12:30,915 --> 00:12:32,565
but it's like i need to feel

353
00:12:32,565 --> 00:12:34,452
like i'm doing something like yeah like

354
00:12:34,485 --> 00:12:35,415

00:19:25,995 --> 00:19:27,855
bring a the smartest person you know

556
00:19:27,855 --> 00:19:30,495
to help you write and that was

557
00:19:30,645 --> 00:19:32,235
very important because there's no way i

558
00:19:32,235 --> 00:19:33,165
would have gotten as far as i

559
00:19:33,165 --> 00:19:34,695
did and then i also had

560
00:19:34,755 --> 00:19:36,405
my dad is my lifeline and then

561
00:19:36,825 --> 00:19:38,265
we should say you brought your husband

562
00:19:38,265 --> 00:19:39,675
mike i brought mike and there's a

563
00:19:39,675 --> 00:19:41,835
new thing to wear you i almost

564
00:19:41,835 --> 00:19:44,055
forgot tall i was i was very

565
00:19:44,055 --> 00:19:45,735
fine line first i went home and

566
00:19:45,735 --> 00:19:46,905
then i was like well it should

567
00:19:46,905 --> 00:19:48,615
be you like you know mike is

568
00:19:48,645 --> 00:19:49,965
mike knows a lot i know i

569
00:19:49,965 --> 00:19:51,285
know what mike knows and doesn't know

570
00:19:51,645 --> 00:19:53,175
so it was very easy to go

571
00:19:53,175 --> 00:19:54,735
like and i was very upset that

572
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:54,855
you

573
00:19:54,885 --> 00:19:57,495
didn't even consider you were your um

574
00:19:57,855 --> 00:19:59,415
you know once i decided that it

575
00:19:59,415 --> 00:20:01,095
was mike there was no even thinking

576
00:20:01,125 --> 00:20:04,125
about everyone although somehow you considered paul

577
00:20:04,125 --> 00:20:05,295
but not me well that was such

578
00:20:05,295 --> 00:20:06,525
a flash you know it was like

579
00:20:06,615 --> 00:20:09,495
this guy who's barely even shines by

580
00:20:09,495 --> 00:20:12,705
the way i normally know like all

581
00:20:12,705 --> 00:20:14,775
the questions ah in

582
00:20:15,655 --> 00:20:16,917
like baron holtz was on one yeah

583
00:20:16,917 --> 00:20:18,655
i watch and he there was a

584
00:20:18,655 --> 00:20:20,136
morse code one that i was just

585
00:20:20,343 --> 00:20:22,375
screaming at the screen wow you knew

586
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:25,732
that yeah work and it may like

587
00:20:25,732 --> 00:20:27,865
because here's something know he he called

588
00:20:27,865 --> 00:20:30,085
his lifeline of his father i believe

589
00:20:30,085 --> 00:20:31,345
and his father gave him the wrong

590
00:20:31,345 --> 00:20:34,405
one wrong answer and was pretty certain

591
00:20:34,405 --> 00:20:35,785
about it but somehow he

592
00:20:35,815 --> 00:20:37,615
worked it out of what his father

593
00:20:37,615 --> 00:20:39,145
was trying to say instead of what

594
00:20:39,145 --> 00:20:41,125
he actually said and did the right

595
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:42,865
answer but i was like with with

596
00:20:43,045 --> 00:20:44,845
having people that you can read really

597
00:20:44,845 --> 00:20:47,845
well because with my dad my dad

598
00:20:47,845 --> 00:20:49,675
eventually while we can get there but

599
00:20:49,765 --> 00:20:52,585
he was confused with his response and

600
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:54,205
then i had to ah okay yes

601
00:20:54,325 --> 00:20:55,945
here's what i think he was

602
00:20:55,945 --> 00:20:58,165
i would say about this right um

603
00:20:58,795 --> 00:21:00,535
but mike was great because he knew

604
00:21:00,535 --> 00:21:01,645
a lot of stuff i didn't know

605
00:21:01,675 --> 00:21:03,355
and yes i should say i was

606
00:21:03,355 --> 00:21:05,275
upset that you didn't consider me until

607
00:21:05,275 --> 00:21:06,415
i saw how you guys did and

608
00:21:06,415 --> 00:21:07,795
you can did you know all the

609
00:21:07,795 --> 00:21:10,165
answers ah your you know what was

610
00:21:10,165 --> 00:21:12,145
interesting is yours in particular i think

611
00:21:12,145 --> 00:21:13,495
once it got up to like sixty

612
00:21:13,495 --> 00:21:16,075
four somewhere around there i didn't know

613
00:21:16,135 --> 00:21:17,035
one or two of them and i

614
00:21:17,035 --> 00:21:18,505
was like yeah she made a bed

615
00:21:18,505 --> 00:21:20,215
we weren't so lucky we're like live

616
00:21:20,215 --> 00:21:21,895
texting while we were watching it right

617
00:21:21,895 --> 00:21:23,335
yeah right yeah know what you didn't

618
00:21:23,335 --> 00:21:25,135
tell anyway you did right and i

619
00:21:25,135 --> 00:21:27,505
was so excited it was very exciting

620
00:21:27,505 --> 00:21:30,805
to watch and i ah mike mike

621
00:21:30,805 --> 00:21:32,545
and i were really doing well and

622
00:21:32,545 --> 00:21:33,355
it was going really well i was

623
00:21:33,355 --> 00:21:35,425
so nervous i truly couldn't even like

624
00:21:36,055 --> 00:21:36,265
thi

625
00:21:36,265 --> 00:21:37,615
think straight i was so nervous and

626
00:21:37,615 --> 00:21:39,145
like so many the questions were really

627
00:21:39,145 --> 00:21:40,315
hard for me and i don't know

628
00:21:40,315 --> 00:21:43,075
a lot about presidents and that's an

629
00:21:43,075 --> 00:21:44,695
interesting thing that came up later so

630
00:21:44,785 --> 00:21:46,255
there was a president question that i

631
00:21:46,255 --> 00:21:48,385
didn't know but mike knew or something

632
00:21:48,385 --> 00:21:50,425
we got through it and then when

633
00:21:50,425 --> 00:21:51,355
then he had to leave and so

634
00:21:51,355 --> 00:21:52,585
at thirty two thousand five hundred i

635
00:21:52,585 --> 00:21:55,135
was alone and the only lifeline trade

636
00:21:55,165 --> 00:21:56,395
him for anyone

637
00:21:56,455 --> 00:21:58,105
no and here's what you could do

638
00:21:58,315 --> 00:22:00,175
you can keep your smartest person for

639
00:22:00,175 --> 00:22:04,525
whatever question he just leaves or you

640
00:22:04,555 --> 00:22:06,805
can get to fifty fifty and i

641
00:22:06,835 --> 00:22:08,515
chose to pick him because i thought

642
00:22:08,665 --> 00:22:09,835
i'd rather talk it out with someone

643
00:22:09,835 --> 00:22:11,125
than have a fifty fifty where i'm

644
00:22:11,125 --> 00:22:12,535
alone a guy that doesn't really help

645
00:22:12,535 --> 00:22:14,815
write sounds so yeah and then the

646
00:22:14,815 --> 00:22:16,255
other thing was because of covert so

647
00:22:16,285 --> 00:22:16,555
everything

648
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:18,025
is just shutting down right that this

649
00:22:18,025 --> 00:22:19,285
was the last day i think the

650
00:22:19,285 --> 00:22:20,215
next day was the last day they

651
00:22:20,215 --> 00:22:22,285
were shooting at all and and someone

652
00:22:22,285 --> 00:22:23,363
had a positive test or something that

653
00:22:23,363 --> 00:22:24,925
was like something crazy that happened shut

654
00:22:24,925 --> 00:22:26,815
down before some people got to play

655
00:22:26,995 --> 00:22:28,165
day so it was really lucky you

656
00:22:28,165 --> 00:22:29,725
know i didn't know that you know

657
00:22:29,725 --> 00:22:30,775
we just didn't know how serious it

658
00:22:30,775 --> 00:22:31,765
was whenever but they didn't have the

659
00:22:31,765 --> 00:22:33,985
audience there well in those episodes like

660
00:22:34,105 --> 00:22:35,995
they're airing two months into coven but

661
00:22:36,025 --> 00:22:36,685
everyone's doing the

662
00:22:36,745 --> 00:22:39,265
cute like touching elbows yeah haha this

663
00:22:39,265 --> 00:22:40,675
is funny you know yeah it was

664
00:22:40,675 --> 00:22:42,775
day one of talking about yeah yeah

665
00:22:42,805 --> 00:22:44,395
never even heard of it and then

666
00:22:44,785 --> 00:22:46,345
um you can they didn't have an

667
00:22:46,345 --> 00:22:47,455
audience where you could do ask the

668
00:22:47,455 --> 00:22:49,225
audience to then you had the option

669
00:22:49,225 --> 00:22:51,055
of chinese economy and now turn out

670
00:22:51,055 --> 00:22:52,585
to be amazing for me he's he's

671
00:22:52,585 --> 00:22:53,935
very good at it oh my god

672
00:22:53,935 --> 00:22:55,285
he was great but he did do

673
00:22:55,285 --> 00:22:56,695
it wrong with kaitlin olson he gave

674
00:22:56,695 --> 00:22:56,905
her the

675
00:22:56,935 --> 00:22:58,975
wrong answer right well do you remember

676
00:22:59,425 --> 00:23:01,495
something about like assuming with the heart

677
00:23:01,555 --> 00:23:04,285
or something like it was a biology

678
00:23:04,285 --> 00:23:06,355
hasn't yeah that's the law he didn't

679
00:23:06,355 --> 00:23:08,108
know where to begin yeah because i

680
00:23:08,108 --> 00:23:09,475
often go to sleep but i had

681
00:23:09,535 --> 00:23:11,935
to do a couple alone and i

682
00:23:12,025 --> 00:23:13,975
think god knew this one there was

683
00:23:14,005 --> 00:23:15,295
i hadn't seen uncut gems yet but

684
00:23:15,295 --> 00:23:17,065
there was an uncut gems question yeah

685
00:23:17,305 --> 00:23:19,375
about what is the rhinestone or the

686
00:23:19,375 --> 00:23:21,631
diamond studded oh yeah and i have

687
00:23:21,631 --> 00:23:22,795
just seen on instagram a lot it

688
00:23:22,795 --> 00:23:23,935
was yeah for me so i got

689
00:23:23,935 --> 00:23:25,585
that which was like amazing because i

690
00:23:25,585 --> 00:23:27,235
never never worked out if i got

691
00:23:27,235 --> 00:23:28,645
it wrong or if i had used

692
00:23:28,645 --> 00:23:29,755
him on that one and he didn't

693
00:23:29,755 --> 00:23:32,155
know it whatever so then the next

694
00:23:32,155 --> 00:23:33,805
one was spelling out atlanta's more sets

695
00:23:33,805 --> 00:23:35,455

697
00:23:37,045 --> 00:23:37,225
knew

698
00:23:37,285 --> 00:23:39,295
but constantly like i was now was

699
00:23:39,295 --> 00:23:41,575
alphabetizing cds with her in and i'd

700
00:23:41,575 --> 00:23:43,465

00:23:46,855 --> 00:23:47,965
think you know and then you start

704
00:23:47,965 --> 00:23:49,045
looking at all the options because they

705
00:23:49,045 --> 00:23:50,575
were all just like different variations of

706
00:23:50,605 --> 00:23:52,945

really good at spelling and then i

709
00:23:55,375 --> 00:23:56,875
called my dad and there was ah

710
00:23:56,965 --> 00:23:57,355

722
00:24:16,585 --> 00:24:17,545
one of those things where oh

723
00:24:17,575 --> 00:24:19,375

oh you know i have to say

740
00:24:44,695 --> 00:24:46,885
that quest easily effective yeah that question

741
00:24:46,885 --> 00:24:48,475

742
00:24:48,475 --> 00:24:50,665
it's yeah it's not fair yeah but

743
00:24:50,695 --> 00:24:53,095

00:25:08,065 --> 00:25:09,625
silent for like ten seconds and then

754
00:25:09,625 --> 00:25:11,215
he goes james and then he hung

00:25:11,995 --> 00:25:12,865

00:25:59,065 --> 00:26:00,235
stay in there i feel like it

786
00:26:00,235 --> 00:26:01,495
was very random that i was there

787
00:26:01,705 --> 00:26:03,235
like jane fonda was i was truly

788
00:26:03,235 --> 00:26:06,325
like just don't let them question this

789
00:26:06,595 --> 00:26:08,395
right but it was amazing we were

790
00:26:08,395 --> 00:26:10,345
all doing so exciting new mop was

791
00:26:10,375 --> 00:26:12,925
was pumping her fists like tiger woods

792
00:26:13,165 --> 00:26:15,775
yeah my god it was crazy and

793
00:26:15,775 --> 00:26:16,345
i played for the

794
00:26:16,375 --> 00:26:17,665
crohn's and colitis foundation and then i

795
00:26:17,665 --> 00:26:18,685

798
00:26:22,675 --> 00:26:25,585
they i mean is that that has

799
00:26:25,585 --> 00:26:27,115
to be one of the biggest i

800
00:26:27,115 --> 00:26:30,595
think so yeah ah no donation donations

801
00:26:30,595 --> 00:26:32,455
that they would although the there must

802
00:26:32,455 --> 00:26:34,405
be i'm sure all of those corporations

803
00:26:34,405 --> 00:26:36,265
have like these fundraisers where people go

804
00:26:36,265 --> 00:26:36,505
like

805
00:26:36,565 --> 00:26:38,275
a million dollars you know yeah they

806
00:26:38,275 --> 00:26:39,685
were really excited though and i think

807
00:26:39,685 --> 00:26:41,185
part of it was like just talking

no idea so whatever and i got

859
00:28:12,295 --> 00:28:13,975
to meet the creator of the show

860
00:28:14,335 --> 00:28:15,505
and that i met some of the

861
00:28:15,505 --> 00:28:16,765
guys who wrote the joe millionaire

862
00:28:18,955 --> 00:28:21,715
joel and the question yes the guys

863
00:28:21,715 --> 00:28:23,845
who wrote the questions were um really

864
00:28:23,845 --> 00:28:25,525
nice and they lie later i was

865
00:28:25,525 --> 00:28:26,845
dealing with them about how there was

866
00:28:26,845 --> 00:28:28,375
like they're like oh this one question

867
00:28:28,375 --> 00:28:29,335
was even supposed to be in your

868
00:28:29,335 --> 00:28:30,625
games so that was so lucky that

869
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:32,695
that happened wow i need it really

870
00:28:32,995 --> 00:28:35,575
like a lot of times just the

871
00:28:35,575 --> 00:28:37,375
stars align for a person

872
00:28:37,465 --> 00:28:39,475
or it's like like your instagram thing

873
00:28:39,535 --> 00:28:41,095
yeah for instance you know where's just

874
00:28:41,095 --> 00:28:43,075
like total luck and then you know

875
00:28:43,075 --> 00:28:44,545
you see other people in there just

876
00:28:44,575 --> 00:28:47,485
after thirty-two they're just they're okay you

877
00:28:47,485 --> 00:28:48,445
know you know when i thought about

878
00:28:48,445 --> 00:28:49,945
using my lifeline on the herbie one

879
00:28:49,945 --> 00:28:51,445
because i knew my dad had seen

880
00:28:51,475 --> 00:28:52,555
uncut gems but i was like i

881
00:28:52,555 --> 00:28:53,919
don't think he'll know what herb yeah

882
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:55,495
yeah when i was like if i

883
00:28:55,705 --> 00:28:57,535
if i waste him that

884
00:28:57,625 --> 00:28:59,072
good thing it's such a it's such

885
00:28:59,224 --> 00:29:00,835
a ah thing you have to wrestle

886
00:29:00,835 --> 00:29:02,095
with like i don't want to waste

887
00:29:02,095 --> 00:29:04,285
lifelines because you can back your mind

888
00:29:04,285 --> 00:29:06,565
into not being sure about anything totally

889
00:29:06,625 --> 00:29:08,485
and so i can like like the

890
00:29:08,485 --> 00:29:10,285
tiffany haddish one that was last night

891
00:29:10,285 --> 00:29:12,655
and you know there was one question

892
00:29:12,655 --> 00:29:14,485
where she worked it out perfectly in

893
00:29:14,485 --> 00:29:15,625
her mind but then she started going

894
00:29:15,625 --> 00:29:16,735
like oh i don't know should i

895
00:29:16,735 --> 00:29:17,755
call this person i call

896
00:29:17,785 --> 00:29:19,405
this you know when you also want

897
00:29:19,405 --> 00:29:20,725
the person to be able to be

898
00:29:20,725 --> 00:29:22,015
your lifeline so i was like what

899
00:29:22,015 --> 00:29:23,725
if i get kicked out and then

900
00:29:23,725 --> 00:29:25,375
he didn't get to ever have the

901
00:29:25,375 --> 00:29:27,715
car or that would suck but being

902
00:29:27,715 --> 00:29:29,005
so but i think the calls are

903
00:29:29,185 --> 00:29:32,935
are almost worthless because most people don't

904
00:29:32,935 --> 00:29:34,765
know to condense the question oh yeah

905
00:29:34,825 --> 00:29:36,683
tiffany haddish didn't really well like she

906
00:29:36,683 --> 00:29:37,945
shorthanded the question but mm

907
00:29:37,945 --> 00:29:40,195
most people yeah say i int every

908
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:41,965
word of the question than say a

909
00:29:42,115 --> 00:29:44,335
disadvantage tell me not to do that

910
00:29:44,365 --> 00:29:45,655
like before and they're like most people

911
00:29:45,655 --> 00:29:46,795
do i don't know if you're on

912
00:29:46,795 --> 00:29:48,025
the phone like you only have thirty

913
00:29:48,025 --> 00:29:49,795
seconds of ah i think my dad

914
00:29:49,795 --> 00:29:51,295
didn't even understand no matter how many

915
00:29:51,295 --> 00:29:53,485
times a explained it though like it's

916
00:29:53,605 --> 00:29:56,635
this much like there's no time to

917
00:29:56,635 --> 00:29:58,105
yeah did you study at

918
00:29:58,105 --> 00:29:59,995
all did joe and i regretted it

919
00:29:59,995 --> 00:30:01,375
because i was like actually almost thinking

920
00:30:01,375 --> 00:30:03,205
about brushy you gotta brush up on

921
00:30:03,205 --> 00:30:04,915
the presidents at at the very least

922
00:30:04,915 --> 00:30:07,585
yeah and well we all should i

923

00:30:10,645 --> 00:30:11,515
of elements i said at the night

926
00:30:11,515 --> 00:30:12,505
before i was like oh i should

927
00:30:12,505 --> 00:30:14,605
study that and then i didn't do

928
00:30:14,605 --> 00:30:15,925
it of course and then the question

929
00:30:15,925 --> 00:30:17,335
was about the periodic table it was

930
00:30:17,335 --> 00:30:18,265
the last question but it wa

931
00:30:18,875 --> 00:30:20,375
um and i wouldn't have and also

932
00:30:20,375 --> 00:30:22,445
by the way couldn't wasn't even on

00:30:22,445 --> 00:30:23,865
the wikipedia up here at a table

934
00:30:23,865 --> 00:30:25,745
yeah it was really hard to find

935
00:30:25,745 --> 00:30:27,125
that information it's like one of those

936
00:30:27,125 --> 00:30:28,745
things where you have to be interested

937
00:30:28,745 --> 00:30:30,125
in that subject in order to know

938
00:30:30,125 --> 00:30:32,735
but it's yeah it's usually usually the

939
00:30:32,735 --> 00:30:34,325
final question is one of these things

940
00:30:34,325 --> 00:30:36,035
where if if it's in your wheelhouse

941
00:30:36,455 --> 00:30:39,035

943
00:30:40,565 --> 00:30:42,185
won the million it was or at

944
00:30:42,185 --> 00:30:43,655

i was making fun of something that

00:31:51,275 --> 00:31:53,345
people like shit no doubt you've heard

973
00:31:53,345 --> 00:31:55,895
of this here's a song so random

974
00:31:56,645 --> 00:31:58,205
the songs were not meant to be

975
00:31:58,205 --> 00:32:00,995
funny i lived for a lot of

976
00:32:01,025 --> 00:32:02,495
fucking us now like this is the

977
00:32:02,525 --> 00:32:04,325
greatest thing that could have happened it's

978
00:32:04,325 --> 00:32:06,605
so not funny now and it's no

979
00:32:06,605 --> 00:32:09,545
fun so funny about it it's no

980
00:32:09,545 --> 00:32:12,185
offense to him i mean oh if

981
00:32:12,185 --> 00:32:13,775
you're listening steve no fancy you know

982
00:32:13,775 --> 00:32:15,725
what's really what's really wild is that

983
00:32:15,725 --> 00:32:16,715
i love when i was

984
00:32:16,715 --> 00:32:18,605
a kid i loved steve martin and

985
00:32:18,815 --> 00:32:22,175
going back and listening to his stuff

986
00:32:22,205 --> 00:32:24,035
as an adult and even thinking about

987
00:32:24,035 --> 00:32:25,235
it like the stuff that i love

988
00:32:25,985 --> 00:32:28,745
it's so anti comedy that yeah doesn't

989
00:32:28,775 --> 00:32:30,065
it doesn't hold up for me at

990
00:32:30,065 --> 00:32:32,225
all really so you only get that

991
00:32:32,473 --> 00:32:33,965
you have to be really aware of

992
00:32:33,965 --> 00:32:36,755
comedy at the time to appreciate what

993
00:32:36,755 --> 00:32:36,875
is

994
00:32:36,905 --> 00:32:38,435
funny about it at the time because

995
00:32:38,435 --> 00:32:40,355
you're like yeah i think playing with

996
00:32:40,715 --> 00:32:41,705
i don't know i remember when i

997
00:32:41,705 --> 00:32:43,085
was a kid i just like because

998
00:32:43,085 --> 00:32:44,405
you is silly you know what i

999
00:32:44,405 --> 00:32:46,595
mean but but now i understand like

1000
00:32:46,595 --> 00:32:49,355
he was subverting what standup was at

1001
00:32:49,355 --> 00:32:50,825
the time it's what i liked about

1002
00:32:50,825 --> 00:32:52,145
it in high school though and when

1003
00:32:52,145 --> 00:32:54,065

1004
00:32:54,155 --> 00:32:55,535
all of the albums and would do

1005
00:32:55,535 --> 00:32:56,975
the jokes over and over again

1006
00:32:57,035 --> 00:32:59,165
yeah so it's like i don't know

1007
00:32:59,165 --> 00:33:01,145
like it's from maybe if i were

1008
00:33:01,145 --> 00:33:02,255
to listen to it again i would

1009
00:33:02,555 --> 00:33:03,575

1010
00:33:03,575 --> 00:33:05,202

it with us that's that's a good

1197
00:40:26,945 --> 00:40:28,805

1425
00:49:11,925 --> 00:49:14,235
we're back and we were just wondering

1426
00:49:14,505 --> 00:49:17,175
if lauren cheated at million yesterday like

1427
00:49:17,175 --> 00:49:18,525
wishes a quiz show or what no

1428
00:49:18,525 --> 00:49:20,415
but you but paul said he wondered

1429
00:49:20,625 --> 00:49:22,455
if my dad possibly was googling there's

1430
00:49:22,455 --> 00:49:25,155
no way for many reasons but part

1431
00:49:25,155 --> 00:49:28,695
of it is that he was confused

1432
00:49:28,725 --> 00:49:29,805
about the ah he goes giddy

1433
00:49:29,835 --> 00:49:32,295
it wrong but he later said i

1434
00:49:32,295 --> 00:49:34,155
just saw a chart a bar chart

1435
00:49:34,155 --> 00:49:35,454
in my guevara for my head and

1436
00:49:35,454 --> 00:49:37,482
i and james had more he kay

1437
00:49:37,482 --> 00:49:40,095
had no reason to understand no

1438
00:49:41,415 --> 00:49:42,675
but actually that's how i describe a

1439
00:49:42,675 --> 00:49:43,663
lot of things so it really makes

1440
00:49:43,663 --> 00:49:44,655
sense like i'm just like i just

1441
00:49:44,655 --> 00:49:46,305
know that that's how that is or

1442
00:49:46,305 --> 00:49:47,865
what i'm remembering yeah know why i

1443
00:49:47,865 --> 00:49:49,665
wonder if you would talk to that

1444
00:49:49,665 --> 00:49:50,625
would you have been able to figure

1445
00:49:50,625 --> 00:49:52,215
it out or no no i swear

1446
00:49:52,425 --> 00:49:53,805
i did talk it out for like

1447
00:49:53,805 --> 00:49:56,865
ten minutes and i was like um

1448
00:49:57,705 --> 00:50:00,015
james literally i was like i don't

1449
00:50:00,015 --> 00:50:01,485
know i was mad

1450
00:50:01,515 --> 00:50:03,465
soon but i i couldn't and then

1451
00:50:03,465 --> 00:50:05,805
jimmy sandbank do you have as much

1452
00:50:05,805 --> 00:50:08,175

00:50:08,265 --> 00:50:10,575

five nights i made a dr phil

1455
00:50:12,525 --> 00:50:13,515
joke at one point about how i

1456
00:50:13,515 --> 00:50:15,555
was taking operating on dr phil time

1457
00:50:15,555 --> 00:50:17,895
because he was taking so long i

1458
00:50:17,895 --> 00:50:19,455
was really on a question about jack

1459
00:50:19,455 --> 00:50:21,045
nicholson times i was like yes wait

how old was this question about time

1462
00:50:23,535 --> 00:50:24,885
it was truly like if you take

1463
00:50:24,885 --> 00:50:26,325
one penny out of a dollar how

1464
00:50:26,325 --> 00:50:27,045

and that's what you know this is

1482
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:01,970
the kind of shit that bothers me

1483
00:51:01,970 --> 00:51:02,660
though about my dream

i need to learn this and i

1489
00:51:12,410 --> 00:51:14,210

1490
00:51:14,210 --> 00:51:17,120
states are because there's only fifty and

1491
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:18,620
there's only forty five presidents and i

1492
00:51:18,620 --> 00:51:20,090
have to be able to like well

1493
00:51:20,090 --> 00:51:21,050
that's the thing to do if you

1494
00:51:21,050 --> 00:51:22,820

1495
00:51:22,820 --> 00:51:25,040

1499
00:51:29,270 --> 00:51:32,600

00:51:34,700 --> 00:51:35,660
and then there's another song about the

1502
00:51:35,660 --> 00:51:36,740

1503
00:51:36,740 --> 00:51:39,110
i never learn these songs yeah that

1504
00:51:39,110 --> 00:51:40,370
would just i could just go through

1505
00:51:40,370 --> 00:51:41,720
it in my head and what's try

1506
00:51:41,733 --> 00:51:42,740
to go backwards we got to

1507
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:44,660
to me humility and we've got ah

1508
00:51:44,690 --> 00:51:47,360
big tea yeah my new ammo he

1509
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:50,540
is ama george w george w bush

1510
00:51:50,540 --> 00:51:52,280
before that is clean tone will clean

1511
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:53,780
tone yeah and then got over that

1512
00:51:53,780 --> 00:51:56,090
of course george h w yeah i

1513
00:51:56,090 --> 00:51:58,490
got for him is ray a little

1514
00:51:58,490 --> 00:52:01,970
male ronald reagan before that is carter

1515
00:52:02,090 --> 00:52:03,140
nosy before

1516
00:52:03,170 --> 00:52:04,700
reagan i would be really confused i

1517
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:07,760
wouldn't feel kabul i remember noisy nadie

1518
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:11,750
my ah tepe my fifth grade teacher

1519
00:52:11,750 --> 00:52:13,400
being very upset and telling the whole

1520
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:15,374
class that ronald reagan was going to

1521
00:52:15,374 --> 00:52:18,890
be a terrible president wow and she

1522
00:52:18,890 --> 00:52:20,780
was so mad carter didn't get reelect

1523
00:52:20,819 --> 00:52:23,030
wow she was right so he looks

1524
00:52:23,030 --> 00:52:23,300
another

1525
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:25,730
that's even another level is knowing whether

1526
00:52:25,730 --> 00:52:27,110
they were a good or bad president

1527
00:52:27,110 --> 00:52:28,940
or what they did exactly i mean

1528
00:52:28,940 --> 00:52:30,200
i could never i could never i

1529
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:32,810
never ever retained i never because in

1530
00:52:32,810 --> 00:52:35,660
school you're not really taught that unless

1531
00:52:35,660 --> 00:52:38,840
there is an actual ah you know

1532
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:41,450
like a nixon scant type scandal thing

1533
00:52:41,450 --> 00:52:43,314
that happened but so okay so this

1534
00:52:43,314 --> 00:52:43,460
is

1535
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:44,660
in before carl this is where it

1536
00:52:44,660 --> 00:52:46,550
starts getting complicated because of the nixon

1537
00:52:46,550 --> 00:52:48,860
thing so before carter it was slower

1538
00:52:48,860 --> 00:52:51,350
so from seventy yes seventy six it

1539
00:52:51,350 --> 00:52:53,300
was forward but ford took over for

1540
00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:56,240
nixon like seventy three i think as

1541
00:52:56,240 --> 00:52:59,000
nixon had just been reelected he had

1542
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:02,390
been reelected and then he got impeached

1543
00:53:02,450 --> 00:53:03,590
or was going to get impeached

1544
00:53:03,620 --> 00:53:05,000
you didn't actually get impeached do some

1545
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:06,740
people get to get impeached while some

1546
00:53:06,740 --> 00:53:08,780
people don't he resigned before his time

1547
00:53:08,780 --> 00:53:11,480
yeah they they basically walked over the

1548
00:53:11,480 --> 00:53:13,580
senators walked over to the white house

1549
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:15,650
yeah in a big dramatic moment said

1550
00:53:15,650 --> 00:53:17,450
hey you've lost all your support if

1551
00:53:17,450 --> 00:53:18,980
you get impeached everyone's going to vote

1552
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:21,470
for you to be impeached wow and

1553
00:53:21,470 --> 00:53:23,571
he said okay i'm gonna resign and

1554
00:53:23,571 --> 00:53:23,780
leave

1555
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:27,860
later and now is this connected to

1556
00:53:28,460 --> 00:53:29,870
what the listeners i held it might

1557
00:53:29,870 --> 00:53:32,540
be so i started learning about ah

1558
00:53:32,630 --> 00:53:33,650
by learning i mean i read like

1559
00:53:33,650 --> 00:53:36,920
a couple tweets about ah the twenty

1560
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:38,660
fifth amendment which is like that sort

1561
00:53:38,660 --> 00:53:39,617
of thing i think we're so if

1562
00:53:39,617 --> 00:53:41,990
the president decides he is going to

1563
00:53:41,990 --> 00:53:43,940
resign then he

1564
00:53:44,060 --> 00:53:45,714
the vice president takes over but if

1565
00:53:45,714 --> 00:53:47,210
he there's like a whole complicated thing

1566
00:53:47,210 --> 00:53:48,137
like if you want to come back

1567
00:53:48,140 --> 00:53:49,490
you can come back yeah well it's

1568
00:53:49,490 --> 00:53:51,440
it's very murky and as a matter

1569
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:54,590
of fact ah dick cheney had to

1570
00:53:54,620 --> 00:53:57,980
like wrote letters that ah like secret

1571
00:53:57,980 --> 00:53:59,570
letters that he only told i think

1572
00:53:59,570 --> 00:54:01,940
his chief of staff about saying if

1573
00:54:01,940 --> 00:54:04,100
i become incapacitated you know

1574
00:54:04,100 --> 00:54:05,690
what to do with these letters because

1575
00:54:05,690 --> 00:54:07,310
he was very worried about the chain

1576
00:54:07,310 --> 00:54:10,310
of command and um but he didn't

1577
00:54:10,310 --> 00:54:11,690
want anyone to know that he had

1578
00:54:11,690 --> 00:54:14,690
written these like resignation letters essentially cheese

1579
00:54:14,690 --> 00:54:15,740
i don't know it's crazy anyway so

1580
00:54:15,740 --> 00:54:18,440
before saying before nixon then you're you're

1581
00:54:18,470 --> 00:54:20,090
sixty eight and this is where it

1582
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:21,950
gets really bad for me lyndon johnson

1583
00:54:21,950 --> 00:54:23,840
lyndon lyndon vi lenin

1584
00:54:24,350 --> 00:54:26,420
and then before that it would have

1585
00:54:26,420 --> 00:54:28,340
been sixty four which would have been

1586
00:54:28,730 --> 00:54:30,890
j f k one yeah yeah because

1587
00:54:30,890 --> 00:54:33,680

sixty three sixty oh so then he

1591
00:54:39,860 --> 00:54:41,750
was he was he was he was

but

1594
00:54:44,510 --> 00:54:47,120

00:56:42,770 --> 00:56:43,905
was like it was it was obviously

1642
00:56:43,905 --> 00:56:46,370
a weird time where where you could

1643
00:56:46,370 --> 00:56:48,380

1896
01:06:29,650 --> 01:06:33,370
disease what's that her disease is if

1899
01:06:40,480 --> 01:06:41,650

shows like ten you know that and

2018
01:11:24,990 --> 01:11:26,550
i have a really exciting pitch for

2019
01:11:26,550 --> 01:11:29,580
you today okay good good stuff so

2020
01:11:29,580 --> 01:11:30,870
do you want to know the title

2021
01:11:30,870 --> 01:11:33,720
first or what you're in charge you

2022
01:11:33,720 --> 01:11:34,170
tell me

2023
01:11:34,230 --> 01:11:35,610
this is your this is your pitch

2024
01:11:35,640 --> 01:11:37,020
we're just the people listened to and

2025
01:11:37,020 --> 01:11:38,820
decide your fate so this show is

2026
01:11:38,820 --> 01:11:42,930
called a million years already happened a

2027
01:11:42,930 --> 01:11:46,290
million years already yeah this is not

2028
01:11:46,290 --> 01:11:49,500
biblical not biblical is it supposed to

2029
01:11:50,220 --> 01:11:52,110
well you believe in the bible yeah

2030
01:11:52,110 --> 01:11:54,030
we do we believe it's literal here's

2031
01:11:54,030 --> 01:11:54,360
the thing

2032
01:11:54,390 --> 01:11:56,970
we keep hoping that things will be

2033
01:11:56,970 --> 01:11:59,970
biblical right and because we are biblical

2034
01:12:00,270 --> 01:12:02,040
ah a million years is hard for

2035
01:12:02,040 --> 01:12:03,330
us to fathom because there's only been

2036
01:12:03,330 --> 01:12:05,310
six thousand years yeah it's really an

2037
01:12:05,370 --> 01:12:06,810
it's actually something that kind of takes

2038
01:12:06,810 --> 01:12:09,600
place in a sort of supernatural realm

2039
01:12:09,630 --> 01:12:12,510
okay the oh wow people sort of

2040
01:12:12,510 --> 01:12:14,520
have lived past lives

2041
01:12:14,790 --> 01:12:17,310
and they have so many feelings inside

2042
01:12:17,490 --> 01:12:19,800
witchcraft stuff like harry potter a little

2043
01:12:19,800 --> 01:12:21,540
bit like that but ran by the

2044
01:12:21,630 --> 01:12:24,332
notorious turf j k rowling we are

2045
01:12:24,332 --> 01:12:25,530
a biblical movie hater

2046
01:12:27,900 --> 01:12:29,580
oh so we don't like her we

2047
01:12:29,580 --> 01:12:31,500
don't think we're like oh no yeah

2048
01:12:31,710 --> 01:12:34,140
that's great so it goes like this

2049
01:12:34,140 --> 01:12:36,660
there's a family of a hundred and

2050
01:12:36,660 --> 01:12:38,880
they lived on one shy of a

2051
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:41,280
dalmatian family and they live on a

2052
01:12:41,310 --> 01:12:44,850
compound and two shy of a later

2053
01:12:44,850 --> 01:12:45,780
donation family

2054
01:12:47,310 --> 01:12:49,650
and the way it works is they

2055
01:12:49,710 --> 01:12:50,640
always

2056
01:12:52,920 --> 01:12:57,960
yes tell us everything about where they

2057
01:12:57,960 --> 01:12:58,830
live like how about the way it

2058
01:12:58,830 --> 01:12:59,550
works is

2059
01:13:00,720 --> 01:13:01,950
one person

2060
01:13:03,060 --> 01:13:04,860
is the is the person who is

2061
01:13:05,010 --> 01:13:06,450

2068
01:13:19,822 --> 01:13:21,420
we have two hands you know to

2069
01:13:21,420 --> 01:13:22,290
apologize

2070
01:13:23,160 --> 01:13:24,030

if you're interested yeah so okay just

2073
01:13:30,671 --> 01:13:33,420
kind of zip through this so work

2074
01:13:33,420 --> 01:13:35,760
says there's one sort of psychic in

2075
01:13:35,760 --> 01:13:37,980
town that everyone speaks to and she's

2076
01:13:38,100 --> 01:13:39,570
no biggest this town there's only one

2077
01:13:39,570 --> 01:13:41,460
psychic well it's a family so really

2078
01:13:41,460 --> 01:13:43,080
how often does that strike twice in

2079
01:13:43,080 --> 01:13:43,320
a fan

2080
01:13:43,320 --> 01:13:45,390
yeah good mostly of town full of

2081
01:13:45,390 --> 01:13:47,160
only ten people she's got let me

2082
01:13:47,580 --> 01:13:49,710
see that i did she go by

2083
01:13:49,710 --> 01:13:50,850
in a question and then she just

2084
01:13:50,850 --> 01:13:52,800
slammed onto right back in my phasing

2085
01:13:52,830 --> 01:13:54,780
she's good well so okay the way

2086
01:13:54,780 --> 01:13:57,360
it works is the one cycle we

2087
01:13:57,360 --> 01:13:59,070
stop saying the way it works is

2088
01:13:59,880 --> 01:14:02,400
your annoying phrases seem to have any

2089
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:02,760
meaning

2090
01:14:03,870 --> 01:14:07,830
you're absolutely right so the unfold is

2091
01:14:08,070 --> 01:14:10,470
so much better actually better i loved

2092
01:14:10,470 --> 01:14:13,650
it there a psychic in the family

2093
01:14:13,680 --> 01:14:16,050
she's very old one hundred and five

2094
01:14:16,050 --> 01:14:19,770
she's the grandmother matriarch and she is

2095
01:14:19,770 --> 01:14:20,820
able to tell you what your past

2096
01:14:20,820 --> 01:14:23,010
lives and everything happened a hundred years

2097
01:14:23,010 --> 01:14:23,640
that already happy

2098
01:14:23,640 --> 01:14:25,440
and and so she tells you what

2099
01:14:25,440 --> 01:14:28,110
happened and you kind of counterstained yourself

2100
01:14:28,110 --> 01:14:30,150
and others based on these types of

2101
01:14:30,360 --> 01:14:32,190
experiences you've already experienced the you are

2102
01:14:32,190 --> 01:14:32,700
called

2103
01:14:33,810 --> 01:14:36,299
and so we also see two really

2104
01:14:36,299 --> 01:14:39,030
quick don't talk wow don't do is

2105
01:14:39,030 --> 01:14:39,390
that

2106
01:14:40,440 --> 01:14:42,090
this is what occurs if he falls

2107
01:14:42,090 --> 01:14:44,640
asleep below what occurs is this isms

2108
01:14:44,730 --> 01:14:48,000
what occurs is how does it unfold

2109
01:14:48,030 --> 01:14:51,240
baby what oh ca

2110
01:14:51,660 --> 01:14:52,140
are you awake

2111
01:14:55,680 --> 01:14:56,970
wait am i getting a phone call

2112
01:14:57,150 --> 01:14:58,767
oh my that's my ringtone is coding

2113
01:14:58,767 --> 01:15:02,010
me what it is there is

2114
01:15:03,510 --> 01:15:07,890
the way that people interact is damaged

2115
01:15:08,190 --> 01:15:11,130
scientist it's damaged by this knowledge dumb

2116
01:15:11,130 --> 01:15:13,020
it down for me oh they be

2117
01:15:13,050 --> 01:15:14,820
basically you look okay so ah what

2118
01:15:14,820 --> 01:15:16,830
would happen is i'd meet your character

2119
01:15:16,830 --> 01:15:18,000
if i was the grandma would say

2120
01:15:18,210 --> 01:15:19,530
oh in the past life you actually

2121
01:15:19,530 --> 01:15:21,823
were um a piece of shit you

2122
01:15:21,930 --> 01:15:23,370
are far you are a murderer

2123
01:15:23,610 --> 01:15:24,360
and then you

2124
01:15:25,830 --> 01:15:27,509
yeah that's pretty easy i guess like

2125
01:15:27,509 --> 01:15:29,550
you took objection and you're able to

2126
01:15:29,610 --> 01:15:32,070
take your murderer and then care about

2127
01:15:32,730 --> 01:15:34,500
a human mess with your life because

2128
01:15:34,500 --> 01:15:35,730
you weren't going to murder but you

2129
01:15:35,730 --> 01:15:37,320
think well i used to and then

2130
01:15:37,320 --> 01:15:39,120
suddenly become the farting murder and everyone's

2131
01:15:39,120 --> 01:15:40,470
trying to catch you and you want

2132
01:15:40,500 --> 01:15:41,430
to set it on my life being

2133
01:15:41,430 --> 01:15:43,560
a happy husband so this is the

2134
01:15:43,560 --> 01:15:44,612
type of thing that will happen so

2135
01:15:44,612 --> 01:15:45,720
my finding out stuff may pass

2136
01:15:45,720 --> 01:15:46,920
as you start to change your future

2137
01:15:46,920 --> 01:15:47,850
