lauren tell me your story please i

89
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,030
beg of you i went to an

90
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:15,510
escape room with a bunch of friends

91
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:17,610
this was this was probably three years

92
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:19,110
ago so they're not friends with you

93
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:19,470
anymore

94
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,310
not all myself and some of them

95
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:25,740
never got out some couldn't get um

96
00:03:25,770 --> 00:03:27,390
i just well first of all my

97
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:29,370
friend mary holland is a huge fan

98
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:31,410
of escape rooms and she goes often

99
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:33,060
and often

100
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:36,690
so two times all regularly i would

101
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:38,040
not have guessed that but i can

102
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,990
see he has a spreadsheet of the

103
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:42,540
rooms and what the deal is she

104
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:43,830
shares it with people who are interested

105
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:45,660
she loves me she returns to decide

106
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:47,250
this on a podcast so it's not

107
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,378
it's not snitching just telling her she

108
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,910
returns to the same ones all the

109
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:53,550
time she i don't think so i

110
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:54,240
think she goes to new ones

111
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:55,708
all time because what's the spreadsheet of

112
00:03:55,708 --> 00:03:56,910
then all of the different ones in

113
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:58,590
law that she's been to and yeah

114
00:03:58,590 --> 00:03:59,790
like if it was good or oh

115
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:01,050
i saying yeah okay i don't know

116
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:01,890
i've never seen it i don't know

117
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:03,690
what the scale of how things but

118
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:04,980
you said she would share it with

119
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:06,510
anyone who's interested i'm not

120
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:09,166
she knows i'm interested i saw i

121
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:11,040
went to one with her this was

122
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,750
before her obsession with them but she

123
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,910
did i think organize this outing with

124
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:17,550
like ten people and it was um

125
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:21,390
downtown l a and we were like

126
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:23,760
in it was like a fake theater

127
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,290
and like then like you know suddenly

128
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:27,840
were trapped inside wasn't ah it was

129
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:29,100
a fake theater it was like a

130
00:04:29,123 --> 00:04:30,630
back stage was like a green room

131
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:32,160
of dressing room of theater and okay

132
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,320
all these props and different things i

133
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,360
just couldn't give myself up to it

134
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,510
enough i think like i'm too competitive

135
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:40,980
without the skill like it's like there's

136
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:42,210
like all the things don't line up

137
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:44,340
for me like you're competitive without the

138
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:46,740
skills i want to win every game

139
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:47,970
yeah i want to

140
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:50,490
when i really want to win but

141
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:52,080
i don't really know how to do

142
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,340
an escape room and i don't really

143
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:55,830
care to solve puzzles that much and

144
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:57,750
so i'm like anxious about how i'm

145
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,790
losing but i have no way to

146
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:01,650
help and i don't really want to

147
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,360
pretend i'm really trapped here on that

148
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,950
i care because i just don't really

149
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,990
want to and i get that that's

150
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:08,160
not fun but that's just

151
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:09,660
what the deal is i don't can

152
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:11,550
i ask you yeah are other people

153
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:15,330
like pretending they're trapped and the stakes

154
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:17,190
are high for everyone i write and

155
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:18,930
i i just don't have the stakes

156
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:20,100
i'm kind of like what didn't you

157
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,050
spend money to get in yeah well

158
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,210
there's the stake i mean ultimately ultimately

159
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:25,740
the stakes are you have to solve

160
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:27,330
the puzzles in a certain amount of

161
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:28,320
time yes and i feel

162
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,940
all the pressure of that everyone's happy

163
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:31,470
we i don't remember actually how it

164
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:31,770
ended

165
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:33,750
yeah he was happy we beat it

166
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:34,620
but i don't remember if we did

167
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:36,750
i really did i don't beat it

168
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:38,250
do you just go the same thing

169
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:39,570
happens you get out of the room

170
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:41,880
yeah why would anyone want beside and

171
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,040
said it beat us there's there's ah

172
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:46,260
that's emasculating i think some if not

173
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:48,060
all of them there's a percentage they

174
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:49,500
give you the percentage of how well

175
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,450
you did yeah okay and so it's

176
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:52,710
like if the sooner you get out

177
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:53,040
the more

178
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,860
x yeah level yeah i just i

179
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:57,060
like that she likes it i think

180
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:58,590
it's very fun that she likes it

181
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:01,050
i just shit competitive yeah i think

182
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:03,180
so yeah i always think if this

183
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:04,440
is your thing like you'd have to

184
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,180
be like yeah i think she always

185
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:08,040
she loves puzzles but you're competitive you're

186

like oh like days which seems like

301
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:47,670
a ridiculous accent that actually work oh

302
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:48,870
because they're like you're from another country

303
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:51,810
you're not american yeah oh yeah what

304
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:54,180
point is like imitating someone's sort of

305
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:57,330
tone of speech when is it racist

306
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,250
like if you go to that's a

307
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:00,060
question because

308
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:03,335
and here's here's a question ah maybe

309
00:10:03,335 --> 00:10:04,025
we'll cut it out

310
00:10:05,195 --> 00:10:06,035
wow

311
00:10:07,355 --> 00:10:08,735
i mean anything by this and i'm

312
00:10:08,795 --> 00:10:11,225
genuinely wondering i enjoyed doing voices and

313
00:10:11,225 --> 00:10:14,465
like trying to imitate people and if

314
00:10:14,675 --> 00:10:15,995
i was telling a story about going

315
00:10:15,995 --> 00:10:17,915
to spawn the my woman who massage

316
00:10:17,945 --> 00:10:19,265
me was saying very funny things and

317
00:10:19,265 --> 00:10:20,435
she had an accent and i was

318
00:10:20,435 --> 00:10:21,995
doing the accent and i'm like how

319
00:10:22,055 --> 00:10:23,705
is that bad i'm like it's like

320
00:10:23,705 --> 00:10:24,455
if i did it if i said

321
00:10:24,455 --> 00:10:26,465
it an american accent i'm not even

322
00:10:26,465 --> 00:10:27,515
trying to tell the story

323
00:10:27,576 --> 00:10:30,095
with what happened like i'm not i'm

324
00:10:30,095 --> 00:10:31,595
not making fun of how she talks

325
00:10:31,595 --> 00:10:34,505
or saying it's bad or wrong right

326
00:10:34,535 --> 00:10:36,035
i'm saying i think sound like the

327
00:10:36,035 --> 00:10:36,785
same way if i talked a little

328
00:10:36,785 --> 00:10:38,075
kid i might be like oh okay

329
00:10:38,525 --> 00:10:39,665
you know it's like it's just kind

330
00:10:39,665 --> 00:10:41,975
of impersonating to give the thanks some

331
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:44,585
of the some of the issue is

332
00:10:44,585 --> 00:10:47,675
that especially in the eighties used

333
00:10:47,675 --> 00:10:49,625
being someone's dialect used to be a

334
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:51,515
way to say they are stupid and

335
00:10:51,515 --> 00:10:53,525
they are less than i was like

336
00:10:53,525 --> 00:10:55,625
oh yeah that's what makes them crazy

337
00:10:55,835 --> 00:10:58,325
yeah oh hahaha they can't speak english

338
00:10:58,325 --> 00:11:00,035
the way we can and it's sort

339
00:11:00,035 --> 00:11:02,465
of been conflated with people who just

340
00:11:02,465 --> 00:11:04,355
like to do accents in the peter

341
00:11:04,355 --> 00:11:07,175
sellars way you know of like oh

342
00:11:07,205 --> 00:11:07,805
and put on

343
00:11:07,865 --> 00:11:10,898
brown face well yeah but but in

344
00:11:10,898 --> 00:11:12,335
the in the sense of like oh

345
00:11:12,365 --> 00:11:15,485
i'm really interested in becoming this specific

346
00:11:15,485 --> 00:11:18,155
person or like the specificity i think

347
00:11:18,155 --> 00:11:20,165
is one like she was being very

348
00:11:20,466 --> 00:11:22,145
funny and like the things she's saying

349
00:11:22,295 --> 00:11:23,555
she's making fun of me and stuff

350
00:11:23,555 --> 00:11:24,485
so it's like to me that makes

351
00:11:24,485 --> 00:11:26,075
the story funnier to tell it how

352
00:11:26,075 --> 00:11:27,605
it was happening i it it i

353
00:11:27,605 --> 00:11:27,995
think it's

354
00:11:28,055 --> 00:11:31,445
like if you if the the source

355
00:11:31,445 --> 00:11:34,715
of your amusement comes solely from this

356
00:11:34,715 --> 00:11:37,625
person trying to speak english yeah that's

357
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:39,875
yeah that's the problem i never when

358
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:42,305
i would think right because also if

359
00:11:42,305 --> 00:11:43,985
you travel anywhere else in the world

360
00:11:43,985 --> 00:11:46,805
and you try to talk you sound

361
00:11:47,105 --> 00:11:48,155
very unaired

362
00:11:48,155 --> 00:11:50,195
located yes because you cannot say anything

363
00:11:50,195 --> 00:11:51,395
i just tried to say a word

364
00:11:51,395 --> 00:11:52,505
in japanese i don't think i did

365
00:11:52,505 --> 00:11:54,936
a price on horrible member speaks japanese

366
00:11:54,936 --> 00:11:56,675
think i selling an idiot so like

367
00:11:56,945 --> 00:11:58,295
that's you can't you have to respect

368
00:11:58,295 --> 00:11:59,345
people come to this country and like

369
00:11:59,345 --> 00:12:01,625
our oh my god alignment not you

370
00:12:01,655 --> 00:12:03,485
have to paul i'll tell you will

371
00:12:03,515 --> 00:12:05,555
not do it but i always think

372
00:12:05,555 --> 00:12:08,285
it's so crazy when people like that

373
00:12:08,345 --> 00:12:09,785
the argument of like speaking lose something

374
00:12:09,785 --> 00:12:10,685
it's like the first one is a

375
00:12:10,685 --> 00:12:11,945
very hard language to learn it's very

376
00:12:11,945 --> 00:12:14,195
complicated it's so like even just like

377
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:15,783
trying does does mike i want to

378
00:12:15,783 --> 00:12:17,045
ask you does he read the japanese

379
00:12:17,045 --> 00:12:19,085
character yeah in this okay yeah i

380
00:12:19,085 --> 00:12:20,735
know i know and he's been he's

381
00:12:21,035 --> 00:12:21,845
not too far

382
00:12:22,985 --> 00:12:25,235
but he can't there's like a there's

383
00:12:25,385 --> 00:12:27,035
you you learned in two different ways

384
00:12:27,035 --> 00:12:29,705
basically he can read this and understand

385
00:12:29,705 --> 00:12:31,715
what the sounds are but not know

386
00:12:31,805 --> 00:12:33,455
ah you know it's like it's there's

387
00:12:33,455 --> 00:12:35,165
like ah there's sounds associated with the

388
00:12:35,165 --> 00:12:36,545
care with the characters and so it's

389
00:12:36,545 --> 00:12:38,675
like syllables a lot of times and

390
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:41,465
then probably also not sometimes i don't

391
00:12:41,465 --> 00:12:42,845
know enough because i haven't been like

392
00:12:43,115 --> 00:12:45,365
watching him do it but then there

393
00:12:45,365 --> 00:12:47,105
are some points where so he'll know

394
00:12:47,135 --> 00:12:49,325
this character means the sound and these

395
00:12:49,325 --> 00:12:52,535
sounds together mean this word but i

396
00:12:52,535 --> 00:12:54,155
also think there's there's a new ah

397
00:12:54,185 --> 00:12:55,985
another wrinkle to it which i learned

398
00:12:56,225 --> 00:12:57,305
i saw a play the other day

399
00:12:57,305 --> 00:13:00,215
that talked about it with tones yeah

400
00:13:00,215 --> 00:13:02,525
there's several rounds that there's a casual

401
00:13:02,525 --> 00:13:03,125
tone

402
00:13:03,425 --> 00:13:04,805
and like is that in japanese as

403
00:13:04,805 --> 00:13:06,485
well yeah yeah so so like tone

404
00:13:06,485 --> 00:13:10,625
one is ah and tone two is

405
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:14,195
like ah until three is like huh

406
00:13:14,555 --> 00:13:16,415
and if you say the same word

407
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:18,005
in different tones it means different things

408
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:19,775
yeah like i have ah i know

409
00:13:19,775 --> 00:13:21,095
i got that wrong no no no

410
00:13:21,095 --> 00:13:22,476
i know we're trying to like pieces

411
00:13:22,476 --> 00:13:23,435
ceo actual

412
00:13:23,435 --> 00:13:26,375
all nine but it's just interesting like

413
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:28,295
thinking about that and being like so

414
00:13:28,295 --> 00:13:30,965
these people from that country know this

415
00:13:30,965 --> 00:13:32,825
really intricate like the sting yeah it's

416
00:13:32,825 --> 00:13:34,775
like knowing some sort of like you

417
00:13:34,775 --> 00:13:37,265
know trigonometry or something yeah instead of

418
00:13:37,265 --> 00:13:39,155
language and then we're like complicated and

419
00:13:39,155 --> 00:13:40,445
they don't use pronouns in the same

420
00:13:40,445 --> 00:13:42,065
way they'll just they have like they

421
00:13:42,305 --> 00:13:43,475
they don't make a sentence in the

422
00:13:43,475 --> 00:13:43,595
se

423
00:13:43,595 --> 00:13:45,155
same way we do so like the

424
00:13:45,155 --> 00:13:46,325
idea that someone is supposed to come

425
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:47,765
here and then understand all of the

426
00:13:47,765 --> 00:13:50,015
intricacies of english which are really complicated

427
00:13:50,015 --> 00:13:51,455
and not like any other language for

428
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:53,615
the most part and really like have

429
00:13:53,645 --> 00:13:55,235
really weird rules and weird way that's

430
00:13:55,235 --> 00:13:57,035
not based on any of the romance

431
00:13:57,035 --> 00:13:59,075
languages or anything like that yeah like

432
00:13:59,075 --> 00:14:01,355
expecting people to be able to master

433
00:14:01,355 --> 00:14:03,755
that like even just like wait and

434
00:14:03,785 --> 00:14:05,345
height are basically spelled the same but

435
00:14:05,345 --> 00:14:07,505
are completely yeah them exactly yeah just

436
00:14:07,505 --> 00:14:09,065
like the whole i before e except

437
00:14:09,065 --> 00:14:11,945
after c but except on the watching

438
00:14:11,945 --> 00:14:13,565
world yeah yeah yeah none of it

439
00:14:13,565 --> 00:14:16,241
makes me ill enough to bleed all

440
00:14:16,241 --> 00:14:16,835
of three

441
00:14:17,945 --> 00:14:19,715
that's really difficult to understand for a

442
00:14:19,715 --> 00:14:21,275
lot of people but it's like they

443
00:14:21,275 --> 00:14:21,755
gotta know

444
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:30,575

to this food court

502
00:16:22,715 --> 00:16:24,995
rt to get something to eat and

503

there was no picket line by the

507
00:16:32,795 --> 00:16:34,025
way oh yeah that yeah they're just

508
00:16:34,025 --> 00:16:35,761
gone yeah i don't know yeah i'm

509
00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:37,535
not sure why i feel like i

510
00:16:37,565 --> 00:16:39,425
ordered the when it happened i ordered

511
00:16:39,425 --> 00:16:40,895
room service and then it never came

512
00:16:41,225 --> 00:16:42,545
what's going on and they said although

513
00:16:42,575 --> 00:16:44,285
oh right we should have told you

514
00:16:44,285 --> 00:16:46,385
this yeah we should yes exactly

515
00:16:46,925 --> 00:16:49,085
like oh yeah here's the explanation why

516
00:16:49,235 --> 00:16:50,645
this was never going to happen but

517
00:16:50,645 --> 00:16:52,235
i acted like it was going to

518
00:16:52,745 --> 00:16:54,815
so i went to the food court

519
00:16:54,815 --> 00:16:57,065
and everything was in french yeah and

520
00:16:57,125 --> 00:16:59,975
i it was the weirdest you start

521
00:16:59,975 --> 00:17:02,045
to panic i've been nitration tell where

522
00:17:02,045 --> 00:17:04,415
it's slow stupid holy shit what do

523
00:17:04,415 --> 00:17:06,815
i it's you know who are they

524
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:09,635
author speaking layers everyone who speaks english

525
00:17:09,635 --> 00:17:10,805
and french and that's why i also

526
00:17:10,805 --> 00:17:12,785
feel inferior when i go there because

527
00:17:12,995 --> 00:17:14,225
they'll be speaking in french oh yeah

528
00:17:14,225 --> 00:17:15,815
they're geniuses there's like oh yeah can

529
00:17:15,815 --> 00:17:17,075
talk with you like what some have

530
00:17:17,075 --> 00:17:20,045
been americans yes well it's just unfair

531
00:17:20,225 --> 00:17:22,445

00:17:22,445 --> 00:17:24,065
in america is a piece of shit

533
00:17:24,305 --> 00:17:27,035
i felt so ignorant and so pr

534
00:17:27,035 --> 00:17:30,995
eventually honestly so wrong that um we

535
00:17:30,995 --> 00:17:34,475
don't teach a secondary language in elementary

536
00:17:34,475 --> 00:17:36,815

00:18:14,753 --> 00:18:15,965
the classic german

554
00:18:17,255 --> 00:18:20,255

i just want to show your american

556
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:26,105
explain here explain the genesis of that

557
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:27,425
because it's something that you hear about

558
00:18:27,425 --> 00:18:28,895
it did one guy want that to

559
00:18:28,895 --> 00:18:31,685
happen is that it's a common thing

560
00:18:31,685 --> 00:18:33,215
i keep hearing like there was a

561
00:18:33,215 --> 00:18:35,825
guy on the equivalent of craigslist in

562
00:18:35,825 --> 00:18:37,295
germany maybe it is crazy maybe

563
00:18:37,355 --> 00:18:38,435
yeah i think it went with a

564
00:18:38,436 --> 00:18:42,425
k yeah yeah okay craigslist he took

565
00:18:42,425 --> 00:18:45,035
out an ad oh i think i

566
00:18:45,035 --> 00:18:46,265
remember that looking for someone to do

567
00:18:46,265 --> 00:18:47,525
this and someone took them up on

568
00:18:47,525 --> 00:18:48,845
it and then there was a trial

569
00:18:48,845 --> 00:18:51,125
where the guy would think they'd be

570
00:18:51,125 --> 00:18:52,745
boiled down to like well isn't it

571
00:18:53,255 --> 00:18:56,195
if did he die did he tell

572
00:18:56,255 --> 00:18:57,455

it

574
00:18:57,545 --> 00:18:59,945
murder what he died i i believe

575
00:18:59,945 --> 00:19:01,805
the gentleman died yes because he just

576
00:19:01,805 --> 00:19:03,455
from cutting off a penis out of

later i draw the line no it's

590
00:19:31,475 --> 00:19:33,005
just like a water gel water balloon

591
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:34,175
breaking just like

592
00:19:35,315 --> 00:19:39,635
um my cousins speak lithuanian my lithuanian

593
00:19:39,635 --> 00:19:41,765
side and my dad speaks with william

594
00:19:41,765 --> 00:19:43,385
but he didn't teach it to us

595
00:19:43,385 --> 00:19:44,555
when we were kids which of your

596
00:19:44,555 --> 00:19:48,270
societies lithuania your identify society my society

597
00:19:49,385 --> 00:19:51,965
said society she's assigned studio and i

598
00:19:51,995 --> 00:19:53,675
understand him not doing because my mom

599
00:19:53,675 --> 00:19:55,655
doesn't speak lithuanian and whenever i like

600
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:58,025
my other relatives married people who also

601
00:19:58,025 --> 00:19:59,645
spoke with nanos more in the household

602
00:19:59,675 --> 00:20:00,875
or your mom and dad both between

603
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:02,195
you know now my mom is greek

604
00:20:02,255 --> 00:20:04,025
greek oh that's um but i like

605
00:20:04,325 --> 00:20:06,785
um and thinking i ah

606
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,910
and feel like oh it's been so

607
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:11,530
cool if i had learned that as

608
00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:13,690
a kid because i would have two

609
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:15,460
languages and then that already opens you

610
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:17,620
up to learning a third lithuanian based

611
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:19,750
on another layer of its closely it

612
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:21,880
sounds like i don't i'm probably only

613
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,440
wrong with this but like to me

614
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,660
it sounds like polish or like it

615
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:27,220
has more in that realm right right

616
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:28,660
um so yeah you could have learn

617
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:31,030
earned one of those languages yeah ah

618
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:32,140
it's too late now too late now

619
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:34,210
i took spanish for seven years and

620
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:36,910
seven in high school which seven from

621
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:38,800
like sixth through twelfth but it's not

622
00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:41,980
enough do you how fluent are you

623
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:45,280
i can't understand ah i can read

624
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,320
and like understand a good amount of

625
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,430
spanish like if i saw like a

626
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:48,751
bill

627
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:49,810
lord i know what it says or

628
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:52,150
like someone by the way chevron tried

629
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:54,370
to just fool a phone and he

630
00:20:54,396 --> 00:20:56,530
threw it at him and i um

631
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:58,840
i can like if i'm overhearing something

632
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,280
i can like pick up pieces oh

633
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,330
they're talking about what time they're going

634
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:02,200
to do something or whatever but it's

635
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,090
like i wouldn't if the conversation gets

636
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:06,460
more complicated wow working as a waiter

637
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:08,950
for ten years i became

638
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:10,360
and and i had taken three years

639
00:21:10,396 --> 00:21:13,270
spanish but i became relatively like able

640
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:15,910
to have a conversation yeah or understand

641
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:17,440
what they were talking about you know

642
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:19,180
um but it's not something where if

643
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:20,590
i went to mexico i would be

644
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:22,120
able to know when i'd feel really

645
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,650
self-conscious if i were trying i did

646
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:24,910
go to mexico and i was like

647
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:26,500
really afraid use my spanish because i

648
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:27,580
just don't want to sound dumb and

649
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:29,050
that's another thing too it's like when

650
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:29,140
you

651
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:31,210
think of people coming here who actually

652
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:33,010
have studied but they're just uncomfortable or

653
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:35,530
afraid trustee right yeah there's probably a

654
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:36,460
lot of that too do you think

655
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:38,380
people then this is sort of my

656
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,750
original question with languages do you think

657
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:44,290
people in other countries appreciate when people

658
00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:46,120
are trying like i found this when

659
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:48,730
i go to mexico are or when

660
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:49,300
i was in costa

661
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:53,170
rica like people appreciate you trying to

662
00:21:53,170 --> 00:21:56,200
sound trite trying to like almost i

663
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,370
feel like i'm sort of doing an

664
00:21:57,370 --> 00:22:00,127
impression like like but they appreciate and

665
00:22:00,127 --> 00:22:01,870
they like it yeah they're always like

666
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:03,370
they always laugh and they always like

667
00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:04,390
it yeah it's a smile on their

668
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:05,560
face and sometimes they'll cut to the

669
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,270
chase and talking english to give you

670
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:08,950
a break but right i think like

671
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:09,460
when i

672
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:11,710
went to france there was a i

673
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:14,170
had an interaction that was like i

674
00:22:14,170 --> 00:22:15,340
was with somebody who was kind of

675
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:16,840
refusing to do that and like it

676
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:19,450
was the person like the woman who

677
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:20,320
was working at the shop was like

678
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:22,780
hating it right and then like refusing

679
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:24,040
to do what to try this to

680
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,810
try oh okay i don't even like

681
00:22:25,810 --> 00:22:27,820
ordering that's what you hear like when

682
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:29,620
i went to france too i heard

683
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:31,840
heard that that's that if you don't

684
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:35,470
try people are angry at you and

685
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:37,060
that's not but that wasn't my experience

686
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:38,915
i witnessed that but i really when

687
00:22:38,915 --> 00:22:40,990
i was doing it myself i usually

688
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:43,180
try or like even it's like it's

689
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:44,560
it's it is hard to do but

690
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,880
that's also part of what makes traveling

691
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:48,430
so great as i was saying son

692
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:49,780

puppy owe it to the attention

694
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:56,920
at first clear my throat but then

695
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:57,760
i did so

696
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:04,150
for me it made me laugh but

697
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:07,420

698
00:23:07,870 --> 00:23:09,910
winding down i look here you're going

699
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:12,310

700
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:13,180
point of order

00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:17,170
so well you did jay went to

but i this is as far as

709
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:33,400
i can go yeah this interaction but

710
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,180
like i remember

we're going like mosher elfie

712
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,640
just think about this people don't in

00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:42,610
america we do not expect we expect

714
00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:44,470
people to say hello you if you're

715
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:46,210
in a store you'd be up for

716
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:47,740
a foreign person's not gonna walk in

717
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:49,270
and say hello in their foreign language

718
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:51,070

721
00:23:55,330 --> 00:23:56,560
is a part of what i've shown

722
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,220
like to me was

723
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:59,140
is that the presumption of of just

724
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:01,420
like we're american we know english the

725
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:03,220
most important thing right so you should

726
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:04,660
speak so here we keep like a

727
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:06,634
french person doesn't walk into a store

728
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,680
in american go bonjour did ah sorry

729
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,450
yeah yeah just in their language just

730
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:12,220
because that's what they are yeah we

731
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:14,590
we do that so rudely yeah so

732
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:15,670
let's say i didn't want this right

733
00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:17,110
yeah right yeah and and but i

734
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:19,390
there was this coffee shop around the

735
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:21,400
corner from us and we would you

736
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,810

1168
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:39,340
what i'm you already owe and just

1169
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:39,610
sort of

1170
00:39:40,690 --> 00:39:42,970
she got here square build that wall

1171
00:39:43,039 --> 00:39:45,490
yeah um what am i sort of

1172
00:39:45,490 --> 00:39:47,290
like an apparition that's just like you're

1173
00:39:47,290 --> 00:39:49,600
just you're just a pair of you're

1174
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,100
just like god you can see the

1175
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:52,690
house and right right right and i

1176
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:54,550
get to see how their relationship works

1177
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:58,690
because probably the fucking watching gets boring

1178
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,790
doctor looks for a way

1179
00:40:00,790 --> 00:40:03,220
week ooh thank you for watching and

1180
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:05,020
gets boring i tell you i would

1181
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:06,490
not get bored watching people fuck for

1182
00:40:06,490 --> 00:40:07,900
one week if i

1183
00:40:08,959 --> 00:40:10,510
need to toast banana you're talking about

1184
00:40:10,510 --> 00:40:12,160
maybe zero if it's like try yeah

1185
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,320
that's true it's like so so so

1186
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,610
it's really more about like hey i

1187
00:40:15,610 --> 00:40:17,320
want to go see how wow today

1188
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:18,610
really like each other well yeah yeah

1189
00:40:18,610 --> 00:40:20,410
yeah something you know trump maligned be

1190
00:40:20,410 --> 00:40:22,540
so interesting to watch i'm like how

1191
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:23,890
do they interact i don't think i

1192
00:40:23,890 --> 00:40:25,420
ever like see each other they might

1193
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:26,530
not i kind of feel that way

1194
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:27,430
but then they'd be an answer to

1195
00:40:27,430 --> 00:40:28,540
the question too they didn't even see

1196
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:29,020
each other like

1197
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:31,130
and if they're not together are you

1198
00:40:31,130 --> 00:40:33,140
seeing anything so i probably wouldn't pick

1199
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:35,390
them because i also hate him so

1200
00:40:35,390 --> 00:40:37,100
i probably pick someone like i wanna

1201
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:38,000
know you're gonna pick up before i

1202
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,180
say mine okay um this is actually

1203
00:40:41,210 --> 00:40:42,560
tough because i don't want to deny

1204
00:40:42,650 --> 00:40:44,180
the premise but i'm trying to think

1205
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:45,770
like i'm wondering if i'd be that

1206
00:40:45,770 --> 00:40:49,130
interested if there's any couple that dynamic

1207
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:49,910
i'm that interesting

1208
00:40:49,910 --> 00:40:51,560
yeah like like there's there's the the

1209
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:52,970
couples who might read more people that

1210
00:40:52,970 --> 00:40:54,560
i know rather than to say yeah

1211
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:55,970
i think ult i think the question

1212
00:40:55,970 --> 00:40:57,560
i really wanna ask is that you

1213
00:40:57,590 --> 00:40:59,030
know oh okay well i was gonna

1214
00:40:59,030 --> 00:41:02,120
say in celebrities there's the the the

1215
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:05,120
people who are like um delightful i

1216
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:06,950
would imagine like ryan gosling and eva

1217
00:41:06,950 --> 00:41:08,630
mendez you know it's like oh i

1218
00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:09,440
would go like to

1219
00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:11,660
watch them have fun together probably they

1220
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:12,905
might not and then they might not

1221
00:41:12,945 --> 00:41:14,420
them that would be bad but but

1222
00:41:14,690 --> 00:41:16,100
but then they're you're right there the

1223
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:17,540
couples where you're like how the fuck

1224
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:19,430
does that work yeah or like i

1225
00:41:19,436 --> 00:41:20,510
do think that happens more in real

1226
00:41:20,510 --> 00:41:22,550
life because you're like you're around people

1227
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:23,840
and they're like oh it's so interesting

1228
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:24,860
i wonder what their dynamic is like

1229
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:26,180
when they're alone right and that would

1230
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:27,650
be more interesting but i i think

1231
00:41:27,650 --> 00:41:28,730
just to be able to answer the

1232
00:41:28,730 --> 00:41:30,230
question we'd have to think about okay

1233
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:31,280
a i guess if it was someone

1234
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,150
i knew i guess it would be

1235
00:41:32,150 --> 00:41:32,540
you in my

1236
00:41:33,590 --> 00:41:34,310
okay like i said

1237
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:36,740
you and paul and your house together

1238
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:40,610
oh wait nobody knows about that ah

1239
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:43,250

1240
00:41:43,610 --> 00:41:45,200
that would be you know a secret

1241
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:47,840
home in the middle relatively far away

1242
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:49,340
and by the way we when we

1243
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:51,590

another home where you ever want no

1247
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:58,912

bomb shelter i can't i can't remember

1340
00:44:46,398 --> 00:44:47,330
on there's always my way

1341
00:44:48,590 --> 00:44:54,230
ah on mansion reference yeah i doing

1342
00:44:54,380 --> 00:44:56,270
okay wait at the haunted mansion at

1343
00:44:56,270 --> 00:44:59,210
disney land there's this moment where you're

1344
00:44:59,210 --> 00:45:00,770
all crowded into a room telling this

1345
00:45:00,770 --> 00:45:01,640
for the people who don't go there

1346
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:03,830
all the time like us freaks iran

1347
00:45:03,950 --> 00:45:04,850
i mean when i moved here i

1348
00:45:04,850 --> 00:45:06,260
was amazed that people were always at

1349
00:45:06,260 --> 00:45:07,640
disneyland i was like this is not

1350
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:08,630
normal this is

1351
00:45:08,660 --> 00:45:11,055
not no one does this but it's

1352
00:45:11,094 --> 00:45:12,650
right because because when you live far

1353
00:45:12,650 --> 00:45:14,660
away it's like a big thing johnson

1354
00:45:14,810 --> 00:45:16,700
and ten years yeah it's it it's

1355
00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:19,310
a hassle but anyways there's a part

1356
00:45:19,310 --> 00:45:20,480
of haunted mansion where you go in

1357
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:22,070
and then you're in this room that's

1358
00:45:22,070 --> 00:45:23,720
all no windows no doors and they

1359
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:25,280
say it's because they close everything off

1360
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:26,570
in weird when you're in this like

1361
00:45:26,570 --> 00:45:28,640
little section of area and then they

1362
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:28,790
say

1363
00:45:28,790 --> 00:45:30,080
so there's always my way out and

1364
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:32,090
they show a hanging skeleton at the

1365
00:45:32,180 --> 00:45:34,340
top and flags on himself in order

1366
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:36,170
to escape this right he had to

1367
00:45:36,170 --> 00:45:38,240
do he's gone to heaven or hell

1368
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:40,070
john depending if it's good or bad

1369
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:41,570

1370
00:45:41,810 --> 00:45:43,040

reference to the haunted mansion but it

1396
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:34,280

there you saw a little rascals movie

1417
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:19,100
where this this guy this man had

1418
00:47:19,130 --> 00:47:20,810
he he leaves the dock he goes

1419
00:47:20,810 --> 00:47:21,950
to the doctors you've got a stiff

1420
00:47:21,950 --> 00:47:23,720
neck yeah the doctor says you have

1421
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:25,580
to like essentially have to like keep

1422
00:47:25,580 --> 00:47:28,730
looking up what horrible advice or his

1423
00:47:28,850 --> 00:47:30,200
hope for his neck is just i

1424
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:31,820
can't remember for a reason right yeah

1425
00:47:31,850 --> 00:47:32,870
look down yeah so

1426
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:34,730
so he's walking around he's walking around

1427
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:36,590
like looking up at one point he's

1428
00:47:36,830 --> 00:47:39,140
waiting for a traffic light and so

1429
00:47:39,140 --> 00:47:40,310
he's just looking up and so all

1430
00:47:40,310 --> 00:47:42,860
these other people like passers-by start looking

1431
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:44,150
up to see what he's looking at

1432
00:47:44,510 --> 00:47:46,010
and then like they keep cutting back

1433
00:47:46,010 --> 00:47:47,330
to it over the course of the

1434
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:49,190
short this i don't remember if this

1435
00:47:49,250 --> 00:47:51,230
if his story ever intersects with a

1436
00:47:51,230 --> 00:47:52,820
little bit of titular rascals

1437
00:47:53,060 --> 00:47:55,130
but it's a really funny gag because

1438
00:47:55,130 --> 00:47:57,860
he masses this huge crowd around him

1439
00:47:57,860 --> 00:47:59,780
now he can't move because right all

1440
00:47:59,780 --> 00:48:01,430
these people are crowd around looking up

1441
00:48:01,430 --> 00:48:02,930
into the sky right well that's human

1442
00:48:02,930 --> 00:48:04,640
nature for you isn't it that's cute

1443
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:08,270

1492
00:49:48,290 --> 00:49:50,960
it was very surprising over the last

1493
00:49:50,990 --> 00:49:53,420
year to find out some of the

1494
00:49:53,420 --> 00:49:54,920

1495
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:57,260
work which i don't think i would

1496
00:49:57,260 --> 00:49:59,240
have found out about um the year

1497
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:01,100
before i think they're right because we

1498
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:03,110
are emboldened feel then yeah they are

1499
00:50:03,110 --> 00:50:04,910

you

1502
00:50:06,950 --> 00:50:08,270

disgust because as a kid i was

1819
01:02:29,695 --> 01:02:31,645
like well that's offing we were trying

1820
01:02:31,645 --> 01:02:33,674
to do it like surrealist where the

1821
01:02:33,685 --> 01:02:35,635
things wouldn't make sense anymore like mickey

1822
01:02:35,665 --> 01:02:37,915
mickey chinese dentists stuff you know yeah

1823
01:02:38,335 --> 01:02:39,565

01:02:39,565 --> 01:02:41,695
on kcp which is a station here

1825
01:02:41,725 --> 01:02:43,405
once and it was it was just

1826
01:02:43,405 --> 01:02:45,685
so bizarre to watch that version that

1827
01:02:45,685 --> 01:02:47,575

certainly lost though i think that was

1831
01:02:53,965 --> 01:02:56,665
based on like do the right thing

1832
01:02:56,665 --> 01:02:58,435
the tv version of that instead of

1833
01:02:58,435 --> 01:03:00,236
