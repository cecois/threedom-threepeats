65
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:57,480

i mean for bad reasons but

231
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:59,130
what would be some good reasons to

232
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:00,570
have member i mean i guess if

233
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:03,690
i read something interesting i mean i

234
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:05,430
used to read magazines on the toilet

235
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,460
yeah so i remember doing that i

236
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:10,200
literally didn't remember the room at all

237
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,420
so i had to google map the

238
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:14,430
place and do a street view and

239
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:15,780
then i saw like i saw a

240
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:17,430
window saw lady showering and

241
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:20,610
so yeah i always high a window

242
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:21,540
i was like that must be a

243
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:22,950
bathroom window there but it must have

244
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:24,540
been in that place now but i

245
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:26,610
don't remember it anyway but what i

246
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:27,990
was here's the topic i want to

247
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:30,120
get to know is i started just

248
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:32,070
thinking about the rooms it made me

249
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:33,390
start thinking about the rooms in the

250
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:35,940
house the rooms where it happened and

251
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:37,050
you're funny funny

252
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,590
and yes it made me start to

253
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:42,510
remember like memories started to flood back

254
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:43,890
to me like things that happened in

255
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:45,390
each room and i want to two

256
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:46,950
are you all alone in the moonlight

257
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:50,160
i believe so memories of the shit

258
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,720
i used to do in these rooms

259
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,010
but i want to see if you

260
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:56,520
guys would imagine a certain room in

261
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,840
the house that you grew up in

262
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,660
and then just start saying whatever kind

263
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:01,800
of came to mind we can go

264
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:02,850
one at a time so you're not

265
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:04,530
talking over each other but okay paul

266
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:05,970
and just kind of come up with

267
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:08,100
any memory in pick one room and

268
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,540
then just think of anything that ever

269
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:10,860
happened to you in that room i

270
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:14,130

in high school i ah

426
00:15:35,065 --> 00:15:37,945

427
00:15:39,295 --> 00:15:40,495
and we were in that room and

428
00:15:40,495 --> 00:15:42,655
we were sitting on the edge of

429
00:15:42,655 --> 00:15:44,515
the bed and guess while we were

430
00:15:44,515 --> 00:15:47,665

434
00:15:57,025 --> 00:16:01,075

435
00:16:01,435 --> 00:16:03,775
and was very put on that's horrible

436
00:16:03,835 --> 00:16:04,975
oh so he walked out he didn't

437
00:16:04,975 --> 00:16:07,405

438
00:16:07,405 --> 00:16:08,875
stop you from doing no no no

439
00:16:08,875 --> 00:16:10,285

with rules said rain it was like

455
00:16:45,475 --> 00:16:48,175

457
00:16:50,605 --> 00:16:52,525
to tell you i hate that there

458
00:16:52,525 --> 00:16:53,725
was an zero i'm no it does

459
00:16:53,725 --> 00:16:55,255
not it was okay in the same

460
00:16:55,255 --> 00:16:57,055
memory and was that janie

461
00:16:58,105 --> 00:17:00,145
yeah that's right the high school we've

462
00:17:00,145 --> 00:17:00,985
known each other since high school

463
00:17:03,505 --> 00:17:05,755
um and i really run that ran

464
00:17:05,755 --> 00:17:08,155
the gamut from i forget your first

465
00:17:08,155 --> 00:17:10,615
two stories and kissing oh you fat

466
00:17:10,615 --> 00:17:12,235
she ran the gamut from i forgot

467
00:17:12,235 --> 00:17:12,961
the first two

468
00:17:15,385 --> 00:17:17,365
wow what a range that story had

469
00:17:17,365 --> 00:17:19,465
everything from i don't remember pursue what

470
00:17:19,465 --> 00:17:19,915
did you say

471
00:17:24,745 --> 00:17:27,325
ah wow i have one more memory

472
00:17:27,325 --> 00:17:28,852
from gay me yeah give it yeah

473
00:17:28,852 --> 00:17:30,025

474
00:17:30,025 --> 00:17:32,875
remember my cousin what are you doing

475
00:17:33,325 --> 00:17:34,675
i don't know i think this is

476
00:17:34,675 --> 00:17:36,985
fun i think it's fun this sounds

477
00:17:36,985 --> 00:17:38,545
like a cold activity now to me

478
00:17:39,265 --> 00:17:40,495
what he's saying is you can remember

479
00:17:40,555 --> 00:17:41,051
because here's

480
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:43,495
you think is happening scots like busy

481
00:17:43,495 --> 00:17:44,935
with something else so he just keeps

482
00:17:44,935 --> 00:17:46,105
making us do things

483
00:17:47,845 --> 00:17:49,465
oh damn cool up walk in here

484
00:17:49,465 --> 00:17:50,725
even though i'd locked the door because

485
00:17:50,725 --> 00:17:53,136
i'm podcasting share wow let me see

486
00:17:53,136 --> 00:17:56,935
ya thanks using key um and the

487
00:17:57,025 --> 00:17:59,245
final memory i can recall from that

488
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:02,365
room was my ah cousin doreen and

489
00:18:02,365 --> 00:18:05,002
i um what there are houses had

490
00:18:05,002 --> 00:18:06,685
joined there were connected by a wall

491
00:18:07,405 --> 00:18:10,855
duplex essentially and ah she had the

492
00:18:10,855 --> 00:18:14,305
room opposite mine and so we we'd

493
00:18:14,305 --> 00:18:15,685
thought it would be fun to devise

494
00:18:15,685 --> 00:18:17,965
a code so we could like tap

495
00:18:17,965 --> 00:18:19,555
on the wall you talk to each

496
00:18:19,555 --> 00:18:22,375
other in the code i devised had

497
00:18:22,375 --> 00:18:25,705
some flaws because it was one i

498
00:18:25,705 --> 00:18:27,265
will say you have told us about

499
00:18:27,265 --> 00:18:27,505
this but

500
00:18:27,535 --> 00:18:29,935
i don't remember ah it was one

501
00:18:30,295 --> 00:18:32,965
a two tabs for b and so

502
00:18:32,965 --> 00:18:34,855
on to oh my god here we

503
00:18:34,855 --> 00:18:36,014
go if you want to know what

504
00:18:36,055 --> 00:18:37,135
z and you've to wait for twenty

505
00:18:37,135 --> 00:18:38,755
six taps we'd never got that far

506
00:18:39,145 --> 00:18:41,455
but i do remember trying to tap

507
00:18:41,455 --> 00:18:43,195
a message to her i remember also

508
00:18:43,225 --> 00:18:45,955
writing it out like if there's a

509
00:18:45,955 --> 00:18:47,485
sheet of paper that had like

510
00:18:47,845 --> 00:18:49,255
oh and you and you like you

511
00:18:49,255 --> 00:18:52,555
think that's morse codes exactly oh my

512
00:18:52,555 --> 00:18:54,355
god my friends and walkie talkies and

513
00:18:54,355 --> 00:18:56,995
tracy want to come out on a

514
00:18:56,995 --> 00:18:59,005
room story sunroom spacious i'm almost chased

515
00:18:59,005 --> 00:19:00,415
my memory go for it

516
00:19:02,215 --> 00:19:05,665
go from memory um i attempted to

517
00:19:05,665 --> 00:19:07,435
send her a message and i was

518
00:19:07,495 --> 00:19:09,745
hitting the wall with a hammer and

519
00:19:09,745 --> 00:19:12,865
then i just eventually wore a hole

520
00:19:12,865 --> 00:19:15,475
in the wall oh god and could

521
00:19:15,475 --> 00:19:17,005
she not really within the closet so

522
00:19:17,005 --> 00:19:18,265
no one ever saw it i got

523
00:19:18,265 --> 00:19:19,945
away with it in the closet she

524
00:19:19,945 --> 00:19:21,745
could hear it but it's like doody

525
00:19:21,745 --> 00:19:23,365
dude i realised

526
00:19:24,595 --> 00:19:26,485
he's doing got taken over by jacko

527
00:19:27,655 --> 00:19:30,055
wacko wacko jacko and his dancing in

528
00:19:30,055 --> 00:19:30,685
his chair

529
00:19:32,245 --> 00:19:34,585
wow um did someone say awake to

530
00:19:34,585 --> 00:19:36,085
hear this or was she totally sleep

531
00:19:36,085 --> 00:19:37,675
and like shout to fuck ah no

532
00:19:37,675 --> 00:19:39,745
she was she wouldn't speak to me

533
00:19:39,745 --> 00:19:42,415
that way we will shot gap i

534
00:19:42,415 --> 00:19:43,705
don't want to hear about how you

535
00:19:43,705 --> 00:19:44,965
want to go to the zoo in

536
00:19:44,965 --> 00:19:46,675
little taps oh

537
00:19:50,935 --> 00:19:52,285
oh i can give you imagining getting

538
00:19:52,293 --> 00:19:54,895
the word z where z means you'd

539
00:19:54,895 --> 00:19:56,305
be sad and you'd probably start over

540
00:19:56,305 --> 00:19:58,705
and say animal place more morse code

541
00:19:58,705 --> 00:20:00,505
was devised because it's quicker as that

542
00:20:00,505 --> 00:20:03,235
would like the awareness so that i

543
00:20:03,235 --> 00:20:05,365
think also to be a code when

544
00:20:05,365 --> 00:20:06,895
you know true but you know instead

545
00:20:06,895 --> 00:20:08,215
of just doing a replacement well because

546
00:20:08,215 --> 00:20:08,305
any

547
00:20:08,305 --> 00:20:10,711
nothing good rely on me that you

548
00:20:10,754 --> 00:20:12,955
get like sica de longs and shorts

549
00:20:12,985 --> 00:20:15,385
longs and longs and shorts and isn't

550
00:20:15,385 --> 00:20:16,945
that what life is longs and shorts

551
00:20:17,065 --> 00:20:19,345
series of which came up on who

552
00:20:19,345 --> 00:20:20,875
wants to be a millionaire recently and

553
00:20:21,025 --> 00:20:22,675
i knew the million dollar answer and

554
00:20:22,675 --> 00:20:24,835
some are there new episodes no no

555
00:20:24,865 --> 00:20:26,215
not right when i say recently i

556
00:20:26,215 --> 00:20:28,015
mean many months ago well because i've

557
00:20:28,015 --> 00:20:28,465
been like wait

558
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:31,435
yeah um walkie talkies you were gonna

559
00:20:31,435 --> 00:20:33,235
say i had walkie-talkies with a friend

560
00:20:33,235 --> 00:20:34,495
of mine and they had morse code

561
00:20:34,555 --> 00:20:36,535
to them um you know paper that

562
00:20:36,535 --> 00:20:38,275
came with yes yes we had the

563
00:20:38,275 --> 00:20:39,805
beeps yeah i can never figure out

564
00:20:39,805 --> 00:20:40,825
what the fuck was going on with

565
00:20:40,825 --> 00:20:42,115
that but we tried

566
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:44,514
um that's why it was supposed to

567
00:20:44,514 --> 00:20:45,745
be an aside within the middle of

568
00:20:45,745 --> 00:20:47,185
your story and not it's own story

569
00:20:47,245 --> 00:20:49,375
yeah really we only did so well

570
00:20:49,615 --> 00:20:50,545
probably as far as we got with

571
00:20:50,545 --> 00:20:52,345
the morse code and walkie-talkies yeah that's

572
00:20:52,345 --> 00:20:54,475
all you really need i'm sleazy save

573
00:20:54,475 --> 00:20:55,345
our ship

574
00:20:56,545 --> 00:20:58,315
i still sort of love walkie talkies

575
00:20:58,345 --> 00:21:00,205
even though yeah we try that we

576
00:21:00,205 --> 00:21:03,025
tried to find some for our right

577
00:21:03,055 --> 00:21:05,395
that's right and someone someone by the

578
00:21:05,395 --> 00:21:06,565
name of coop said she would buy

579
00:21:06,565 --> 00:21:07,825
us all walkie talkies and then the

580
00:21:07,825 --> 00:21:09,805
day came and there were no walkie-talkies

581
00:21:10,255 --> 00:21:12,055
think that's probably for the best i

582
00:21:12,055 --> 00:21:14,275
feel like there was further discussion well

583
00:21:14,275 --> 00:21:15,505
yeah so there's an app there's a

584
00:21:15,505 --> 00:21:16,645
walkie talkie that

585
00:21:16,645 --> 00:21:18,055
that's what a doll came down to

586
00:21:18,055 --> 00:21:19,195
is like oh let's just do the

587
00:21:19,195 --> 00:21:20,665
app instead and then no one gothia

588
00:21:20,815 --> 00:21:23,035
the upsets it's just like once just

589
00:21:23,035 --> 00:21:25,045
face time yeah that's what it ended

590
00:21:25,045 --> 00:21:27,445
that's always good and the biggest biggest

591
00:21:27,445 --> 00:21:31,015
scream was ah john's with his initials

592
00:21:31,015 --> 00:21:33,055
taking up almost entirely the entire thing

593
00:21:33,085 --> 00:21:34,885

618
00:22:26,425 --> 00:22:27,895

629
00:22:52,345 --> 00:22:54,955

that why you did no no i

631
00:22:57,325 --> 00:22:59,425
barley real life um

632
00:23:01,495 --> 00:23:03,355
i did get bullied online but it's

633
00:23:03,355 --> 00:23:06,115
okay um i'm okay we figured out

634
00:23:06,115 --> 00:23:07,285
who it was at one point and

635
00:23:07,285 --> 00:23:09,985
it was pretty exciting the prison where

636
00:23:09,985 --> 00:23:12,595
their consequences no

637
00:23:14,155 --> 00:23:16,615
okay yeah we just were like who

638
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:18,025
knows fuck you and then it was

639
00:23:18,025 --> 00:23:20,665
like whatever still got made fun of

640
00:23:21,355 --> 00:23:24,145
um and then okay another memory from

641
00:23:24,145 --> 00:23:27,955
that room is that the an opossum

642
00:23:27,955 --> 00:23:29,035
came up to the back door i

643
00:23:29,035 --> 00:23:30,895
have i told you the story no

644
00:23:31,015 --> 00:23:33,805
bats opossums and this is this is

645
00:23:33,805 --> 00:23:33,925
a

646
00:23:34,165 --> 00:23:37,045
by the way naturally i wish i

647
00:23:37,045 --> 00:23:38,695
might have brought this up because i

648
00:23:38,695 --> 00:23:39,985
always wonder about this how do you

649
00:23:39,985 --> 00:23:42,295
say a possum or possum i say

650
00:23:42,325 --> 00:23:43,975
possum but i see that's how i

651
00:23:43,975 --> 00:23:46,015
was raised i say possum too but

652
00:23:46,015 --> 00:23:47,665
i think the correct thing is actually

653
00:23:47,665 --> 00:23:49,795
a possum i had like a full

654
00:23:49,795 --> 00:23:51,685
debate during wild horses one time like

655
00:23:51,685 --> 00:23:53,725
on stage about this and i was

656
00:23:53,725 --> 00:23:54,085
the owner

657
00:23:54,085 --> 00:23:56,965
only wild horses show yeah

658
00:23:58,218 --> 00:24:02,485
like you guys it doesn't um because

659
00:24:02,485 --> 00:24:04,015
i was only one who said a

660
00:24:04,015 --> 00:24:06,565
possum and everyone thought i don't also

661
00:24:06,625 --> 00:24:08,635
awesome that's and then the half the

662
00:24:08,635 --> 00:24:10,045
audience was like no it's a thing

663
00:24:10,045 --> 00:24:10,945
and then i googled it later and

664
00:24:10,945 --> 00:24:11,965
i was like any other thing and

665
00:24:11,965 --> 00:24:15,565
then whatever so they're commonly referred to

666
00:24:15,565 --> 00:24:18,295
as possums yes but they sometimes rendered

667
00:24:18,355 --> 00:24:22,045
as apostrophe possums that's too much but

668
00:24:22,225 --> 00:24:24,625
where i'm from i never heard it

669
00:24:24,625 --> 00:24:26,095
possum sounded like a hick would say

670
00:24:26,095 --> 00:24:28,525
it power awesome yeah yeah like the

671
00:24:28,525 --> 00:24:31,735
beverly hillbillies yeah whoa turns were simple

672
00:24:31,735 --> 00:24:33,625
country folks so that's it makes sense

673
00:24:33,625 --> 00:24:34,645
that they would have taught everyone it

674
00:24:34,645 --> 00:24:36,145
sounds like everyone was doing it that

675
00:24:36,145 --> 00:24:38,485
way except me but um there

676
00:24:38,485 --> 00:24:40,015
or was this possum that came up

677
00:24:40,015 --> 00:24:42,655
to the back door and it was

678
00:24:43,645 --> 00:24:45,775
i thought rabbit but then i recently

679
00:24:45,775 --> 00:24:47,965
read online that they can't get rabies

680
00:24:48,055 --> 00:24:50,065
but somebody random wrote that i don't

681
00:24:50,065 --> 00:24:52,465
know that's true some random wrote a

682
00:24:52,478 --> 00:24:54,325
possums can get rabies can you google

683
00:24:54,325 --> 00:24:57,205
that no i don't think that's true

684
00:24:57,235 --> 00:24:58,645
at all i've never

685
00:24:58,645 --> 00:24:59,875
you had me here there why would

686
00:24:59,875 --> 00:25:01,705
they not get it anyway i think

687
00:25:01,705 --> 00:25:03,715
it had rabies so what happened so

688
00:25:03,715 --> 00:25:05,232
we came up to the door and

689
00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:06,505
in the middle of the day and

690
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:08,155
it was like yeah me it was

691
00:25:08,155 --> 00:25:10,285
being really nasty to my cat and

692
00:25:10,315 --> 00:25:11,095
and that we are all kind of

693
00:25:11,156 --> 00:25:12,055
gassy

694
00:25:14,125 --> 00:25:16,675
and my dad hit it with a

695
00:25:16,975 --> 00:25:17,485
bat

696
00:25:18,775 --> 00:25:21,865
baseball oh i thought it was the

697
00:25:21,865 --> 00:25:23,455
bat that got chased out of paul's

698
00:25:23,485 --> 00:25:24,865
i know it could have been but

699
00:25:24,895 --> 00:25:26,485
you hit with the bed you have

700
00:25:26,485 --> 00:25:28,015
told me that story and i blocked

701
00:25:28,015 --> 00:25:29,185
it out of my mind yeah i

702
00:25:29,185 --> 00:25:30,175
know i've told this story a bunch

703
00:25:30,175 --> 00:25:31,735
of times so so didn't break it's

704
00:25:31,735 --> 00:25:33,925
back and like blood spatter on the

705
00:25:33,925 --> 00:25:36,115
head but then it then walked away

706
00:25:36,685 --> 00:25:38,605
it locked away it laughing

707
00:25:38,755 --> 00:25:41,515
okay wow and then from by the

708
00:25:41,545 --> 00:25:44,395
time i went to school the next

709
00:25:44,395 --> 00:25:47,125

context is not a big deal really

778
00:27:55,855 --> 00:27:57,145
it just kind of like this is

779
00:27:57,145 --> 00:27:59,305
just yeah something you gotta deal with

780
00:27:59,395 --> 00:28:00,865
is to tell you about costa rica

781
00:28:00,865 --> 00:28:01,465
how like

782
00:28:02,695 --> 00:28:03,985

00:28:06,805 --> 00:28:08,065
of all it was out in the

786
00:28:08,065 --> 00:28:10,765
middle of the day being um aggressive

787
00:28:10,795 --> 00:28:12,775

789
00:28:15,565 --> 00:28:17,305

790
00:28:17,305 --> 00:28:19,405
since he's done that wow

791
00:28:20,695 --> 00:28:22,165

00:28:22,165 --> 00:28:23,575
tell you about in costa rica how

793

in the hotel we were staying at

794
00:28:25,765 --> 00:28:27,565
like lizards would just come into your

795
00:28:27,925 --> 00:28:30,865

800
00:28:37,285 --> 00:28:38,575
it depends on how big they are

801
00:28:39,145 --> 00:28:40,165
will do they ever come on the

802
00:28:40,195 --> 00:28:42,385

803
00:28:42,625 --> 00:28:44,097

know in years past and nobody's coming

833
00:29:41,965 --> 00:29:43,705
home anymore and everyone's moved in everyone's

834
00:29:44,035 --> 00:29:45,385

836
00:29:48,595 --> 00:29:49,705

838
00:29:50,995 --> 00:29:52,225
kinda like let's just move it along

839
00:29:52,225 --> 00:29:55,615
the real second string material but my

840
00:29:56,065 --> 00:29:57,085
we would put all of our coats

841
00:29:57,115 --> 00:29:59,335
in the office and my friend was

842
00:29:59,335 --> 00:30:01,345
standing in there and she told me

843
00:30:01,435 --> 00:30:03,745
from afar that she was having a

844
00:30:03,745 --> 00:30:06,685
baby and she was twenty four twenty

845
00:30:06,685 --> 00:30:08,095
five they had recently gotten married they

846
00:30:08,095 --> 00:30:10,195
are pretty young so she told you

847
00:30:10,195 --> 00:30:10,975
from afar

848
00:30:11,125 --> 00:30:14,180
maybe she's like twenty eight shy guys

849
00:30:14,185 --> 00:30:15,505
wow well no i mean i was

850
00:30:15,505 --> 00:30:15,685

851
00:30:17,455 --> 00:30:17,965
i was not

852
00:30:19,370 --> 00:30:21,325
remember i wasn't standing in the room

853
00:30:21,325 --> 00:30:22,675
but i was looking at her in

854
00:30:22,675 --> 00:30:23,965
there and that's what the memory is

855
00:30:23,995 --> 00:30:24,895
of her telling me that and then

856
00:30:24,895 --> 00:30:25,135
i was like

857
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:29,125
um and then let me think of

858
00:30:29,125 --> 00:30:29,845
another memory

859
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:33,490
no matter how lucky they are good

860
00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:35,620
memories okay i got another one well

861
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:36,970
just to give you a little pastiche

862
00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:40,360
you know yeah yeah um pistachio these

863
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:42,070
and other stories i just i just

864
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:44,710
want like glimpses of memories so when

865
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:46,960
i was little my dad had a

866
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,850
rubber stamp memories

867
00:30:50,277 --> 00:30:52,720
when i was little my oh yeah

868
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,280
bring it back so it's t-shirts so

869
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:58,570
ah when i was little my dad

870
00:30:58,570 --> 00:31:00,940
had ace rubber stamp of his signature

871
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:02,980
because i guess other people would use

872
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:04,930
it for his work to sign checks

873
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:06,459
or whatever i guess it sounds like

874
00:31:06,459 --> 00:31:08,350
this drug plus he would use it

875
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:09,371
i don't i guess i was little

876
00:31:09,371 --> 00:31:10,150
so i never really noticed

877
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:12,340
yeah why what's happening to the authorize

878
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:14,080
yeah yeah yeah so he was probably

879
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:18,190
stamping him and i had used that

880
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:20,650
i remember sneaking under his drafting table

881
00:31:20,650 --> 00:31:22,900
to get it out and to like

882
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:24,670
say a report card to sign that

883
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,460
ah permission slip or something oh the

884
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:29,260
thing the thing was at my parents'

885
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,310
classes going to a strip

886
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:30,640
club

887
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:34,210
i never needed it i never like

888
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:35,860
i was always in charge of like

889
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:37,750
just doing all that stuff like getting

890
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:40,210
all my forms together and like keeping

891
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:42,514
track of all that and i it

892
00:31:42,514 --> 00:31:44,140
was just a simpler you know way

893
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:45,730
to do it just be like he's

894
00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:48,010
got it we're good and it worked

895
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,950
and they never found out no one

896
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:51,902
ever thought anything of

897
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:52,060
it

898
00:31:53,230 --> 00:31:54,250
like does he know that it was

899
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:56,650
happening or they they just would my

900

1042
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:47,920
the walls and the ceiling and still

1043
00:36:48,130 --> 00:36:50,350

not to do that

00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:54,460
i think you made that up and

1046
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:56,200
then i also remember a beautiful dream

1047
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:58,720
you have i also remember that was

1048
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,280
the first time i ever had anesthesia

1049
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:02,110
and them saying like okay now count

1050
00:37:02,110 --> 00:37:03,790
backwards from ten and me going

1051
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:07,510
tens not enough numbers for this guy

1052
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:10,570
ten nine com yeah and yeah and

1053
00:37:10,570 --> 00:37:12,070
then waking up later they do you

1054
00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:14,620
think anaesthesiologists love that like they know

1055
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:16,180
that that's what people think and they're

1056
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:18,190
like oh okay okay oh my god

1057
00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:19,390
give you a bigger dose if you

1058
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:20,740
need it have we talked with this

1059
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:22,030
when i got my wisdom teeth out

1060
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:24,040
like five years ago or something now

1061
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:24,790
more than that now

1062
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:28,300
um i was under anesthesia and then

1063
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:30,340
i came out of it and i

1064
00:37:30,370 --> 00:37:32,380
was saying that my doctors like george

1065
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:35,662
clooney not true quebec and then also

1066
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,360
a saying i just tell him about

1067
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:39,010
my improv showing that they should come

1068
00:37:39,010 --> 00:37:39,580
to it

1069
00:37:41,770 --> 00:37:43,120
it's so embarrassing

1070
00:37:44,050 --> 00:37:45,190
do you think the doctor made up

1071
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:46,237
the part about you saying he looked

1072
00:37:46,237 --> 00:37:48,460
like george clooney because that's what i

1073
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:49,931
would do it because i started out

1074
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:51,070
funny you know i think i kind

1075
00:37:51,070 --> 00:37:52,720
of remember one of my patients when

1076
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,070
they come out of anesthesia since the

1077
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:56,500
senior was very handsome like a movie

1078
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:58,180
star no i think i remember it

1079
00:37:58,180 --> 00:38:00,280
but be like told back to me

1080
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,840
like i kind of remembered saying it

1081
00:38:02,350 --> 00:38:03,250
but it was like

1082
00:38:04,270 --> 00:38:05,470
oh and then i was crying because

1083
00:38:05,470 --> 00:38:06,670
it told me i couldn't play basketball

1084
00:38:06,670 --> 00:38:07,120
anymore

1085
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:11,920
why after the operation yeah whatever while

1086
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:12,910
i was on the basketball team at

1087
00:38:12,910 --> 00:38:14,770
the time and my wisdom teeth this

1088
00:38:14,770 --> 00:38:16,180
was i mean in my thirties this

1089
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:17,560
or you know my late twenties when

1090
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:19,000
the older girls were playing basketball in

1091
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,250
that like comedy league oh yeah yeah

1092
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:23,315
i'm very confused i was a little

1093
00:38:23,315 --> 00:38:24,490
bit too yeah it didn't make any

1094
00:38:24,490 --> 00:38:25,450
sense and

1095
00:38:27,910 --> 00:38:29,620
i got my wisdom teeth out and

1096
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:31,570
they were very impacted like they'd been

1097
00:38:31,570 --> 00:38:33,250
like going sideways for like very many

1098
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:35,230
years and then when they took them

1099
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:37,900
out the bone here where the wisdom

1100
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:40,570
teeth are was very very thin and

1101
00:38:40,570 --> 00:38:41,890
they were like if you got hit

1102
00:38:41,890 --> 00:38:43,630
with the ball it can break your

1103
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:46,600
job she's she's raised and

1104
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:47,590
i already had already been hit in

1105
00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:48,520
the face with the ball because i'm

1106
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:51,070
not good at basketball and so i

1107
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:51,790
was like i have to quit but

1108
00:38:51,790 --> 00:38:52,840

00:44:52,212 --> 00:44:54,190
we we had a scam where whew

1289
00:44:54,490 --> 00:44:56,080
one of us would buy a ticket

1290
00:44:56,620 --> 00:44:58,840
and then open the back door yeah

1291
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:01,480
the person in and then our plan

1292
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:03,550
was if anyone ever asked us we

1293
00:45:03,670 --> 00:45:04,840
would we would pull out the one

1294
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:06,130
ticket and go oh i lost my

1295
00:45:06,130 --> 00:45:07,690
stub but they can't kick us

1296
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:10,330
out for having one ticket and know

1297
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:13,330
it always works except one time some

1298
00:45:13,330 --> 00:45:14,800
guy came in and was like hey

1299
00:45:14,950 --> 00:45:16,930
you guys snuck in and we pulled

1300
00:45:16,930 --> 00:45:18,460
out the one ticket we're like oh

1301
00:45:18,460 --> 00:45:19,600
we can't find the other one he

1302
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:21,670
was like i know what you did

1303
00:45:21,670 --> 00:45:23,050
but i can't kick you out and

1304
00:45:23,050 --> 00:45:25,066
he walked away ah you must have

1305
00:45:25,066 --> 00:45:27,400
felt really proud it's just a kick

1306
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:28,120
you out if you don't have

1307
00:45:28,150 --> 00:45:28,540
a ticket

1308
00:45:29,590 --> 00:45:31,270
yeah i guess i could but i

1309
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:33,490
don't know ah what have you walked

1310
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:35,470
right in the front like i guess

1311
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:37,750
i'd like to get sob i feel

1312
00:45:37,750 --> 00:45:38,710
like making a big deal out of

1313
00:45:38,710 --> 00:45:40,030
someone sneaking into the movies is very

1314
00:45:40,030 --> 00:45:42,640
petty yeah and being like you need

1315
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:45,280
to leave it's like you're not really

1316
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:47,770
making money off of this like me

1317
00:45:47,770 --> 00:45:49,600
sitting here doesn't affect how much money

1318
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:49,720
is

1319
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:51,040
coming in or money is just a

1320
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:51,940
concept anyway

1321
00:45:53,140 --> 00:45:54,490
to make people think they're poor

1322
00:45:55,870 --> 00:45:58,030
yeah it's really deep man power your

1323
00:45:58,030 --> 00:46:01,090
parents cheap they were thrifty because we

1324
00:46:01,090 --> 00:46:03,940
were not ah particularly well off but

1325
00:46:03,940 --> 00:46:07,000
they were very good at um hiding

1326
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,040
that from us so when i was

1327
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:10,300
a kid i thought of them as

1328
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:11,920
cheap and now i realised they were

1329
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:15,880
not yeah my dad had a thing

1330
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:18,550
how about he he just didn't want

1331
00:46:18,550 --> 00:46:20,290
to pay anyone to do anything that

1332
00:46:20,290 --> 00:46:21,790
he felt like he could do himself

1333
00:46:22,390 --> 00:46:23,830
so all sorts of things and he

1334
00:46:23,830 --> 00:46:25,240
still does it but it all sorts

1335
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:27,430
of things happening where like i remember

1336
00:46:27,790 --> 00:46:30,580
a cement mixer pulling up to the

1337
00:46:30,580 --> 00:46:32,950
back to our backyard of that old

1338
00:46:32,950 --> 00:46:34,540
house in him like taking out the

1339
00:46:34,540 --> 00:46:36,040
bricks in the wall

1340
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:38,440
call so that the cement mixer could

1341
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:40,960
like poor cement because he wanted to

1342
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:44,110
pave the the backyard himself and he

1343
00:46:44,110 --> 00:46:45,520
did it all himself like he would

1344
00:46:45,580 --> 00:46:47,290
he he did all the tile in

1345
00:46:47,290 --> 00:46:49,390
our new house himself show us do

1346
00:46:49,390 --> 00:46:50,800
it dump all your cement and i'll

1347
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:52,240
take it from there yeah it was

1348
00:46:52,390 --> 00:46:53,380
it was but it was a big

1349
00:46:53,380 --> 00:46:55,030
day it was a big day for

1350
00:46:55,030 --> 00:46:56,170
sure hood where people were

1351
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:57,520
like coming by going like oh look

1352
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:59,230
at the cement truck you know same

1353
00:46:59,230 --> 00:47:00,940
thing is when he like hauled out

1354
00:47:00,940 --> 00:47:02,590
a huge tree himself with the help

1355
00:47:02,590 --> 00:47:04,510
of like five of this church buddies

1356
00:47:04,510 --> 00:47:05,920
it was like the whole neighborhood came

1357
00:47:06,280 --> 00:47:08,260
around like checking out the the tree

1358
00:47:08,260 --> 00:47:09,760
being the power are in your job

1359
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:11,920
zoning out nil i'm just i'm actually

1360
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:14,710
thinking about a question for you oh

1361
00:47:14,710 --> 00:47:15,700
okay hit me

1362
00:47:16,510 --> 00:47:17,800
once a gambling scrambling it's

1363
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:22,570
no i was gonna say like you

1364
00:47:22,570 --> 00:47:25,750
don't mind outsourcing you prefer it i

1365
00:47:25,750 --> 00:47:29,649
prefer it because i there's yeah like

1366
00:47:29,740 --> 00:47:30,970
find i don't find it a waste

1367
00:47:30,970 --> 00:47:32,470
of money to for me to pay

1368
00:47:32,470 --> 00:47:34,720
someone to do something that i i

1369
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:36,250
can't do like i've fixed are like

1370
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:39,130
hearing stuff like that especially during quorum

1371
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:40,030
teen when i was like oh no

1372
00:47:40,030 --> 00:47:41,620
one can come by the house so

1373
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:43,450
yeah i would watch a youtube video

1374
00:47:43,450 --> 00:47:44,530
and i figured out how to do

1375
00:47:44,530 --> 00:47:45,670
it and like you there there is

1376
00:47:45,670 --> 00:47:47,050
a pride to it but it's like

1377
00:47:47,290 --> 00:47:48,070
then you look at it and go

1378
00:47:48,070 --> 00:47:49,330
oh three hours of my life are

1379
00:47:49,330 --> 00:47:50,860
gone when i could've been doing something

1380
00:47:50,860 --> 00:47:52,030
else yeah i mean i think if

1381
00:47:52,030 --> 00:47:53,920
there's a situation where someone could do

1382
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:56,500
it much faster and more effectively and

1383
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:58,990
efficiently i'd much rather outsource it

1384
00:47:59,350 --> 00:48:01,750
um but i but only with things

1385
00:48:01,750 --> 00:48:02,920
that i'm like not sure i'm going

1386
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:04,450
to do right or that might be

1387
00:48:04,450 --> 00:48:06,610
hard like i don't mind cleaning but

1388
00:48:06,610 --> 00:48:09,160
i don't want to fix like an

1389
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:11,260
appliance really i'd rather just call someone

1390
00:48:11,260 --> 00:48:12,938
and make sure they've done proper but

1391
00:48:12,938 --> 00:48:14,320
if you knew how to do it

1392
00:48:14,740 --> 00:48:16,510
and it's still like you weren't you

1393
00:48:16,510 --> 00:48:17,710
weren't doing it all the time like

1394
00:48:17,710 --> 00:48:18,970
a professional so it would take you

1395
00:48:18,970 --> 00:48:19,480
five times

1396
00:48:19,552 --> 00:48:21,280
as long but you knew how to

1397
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:22,990
do it would you do it that's

1398
00:48:22,990 --> 00:48:25,840
my dad i'm saying i don't so

1399
00:48:25,870 --> 00:48:28,120
i don't think so dependent depends on

1400
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:29,830
what it is but i feel like

1401
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:34,600
the idea of me spending hours trying

1402
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:36,670
to fix something and not being i

1403
00:48:36,670 --> 00:48:37,720
mean i don't know i just it

1404
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:38,680
feels um

1405
00:48:39,790 --> 00:48:42,850
feudal yeah i let him you're saying

1406
00:48:42,850 --> 00:48:44,500
in this hypothetical i do know how

1407
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:46,750
to do the thing so unless you

1408
00:48:46,810 --> 00:48:48,550
like you have done it before you're

1409
00:48:48,550 --> 00:48:49,540
like oh i know how to do

1410
00:48:49,540 --> 00:48:51,430
that it's like longtime for example i'll

1411
00:48:51,430 --> 00:48:53,620
plunge a toilet i'll figure that out

1412
00:48:53,650 --> 00:48:55,900
oh yeah i hope so but i

1413
00:48:55,900 --> 00:48:58,330
mean like that we had we had

1414
00:48:58,330 --> 00:48:59,800
a toilet overflow

1415
00:49:00,370 --> 00:49:02,080
and then i was like i think

1416
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:03,310
i could talk to my dad and

1417
00:49:03,310 --> 00:49:04,570
figure out how to do everything and

1418
00:49:04,570 --> 00:49:05,740
i did it all and i think

1419
00:49:05,950 --> 00:49:07,060
but it's been a plumber got there

1420
00:49:07,060 --> 00:49:08,200
which i did call anyway just to

1421
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:10,180
make sure it was things like you

1422
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:11,950
check my work because i make shit

1423
00:49:11,950 --> 00:49:13,570
everywhere like this why do you like

1424
00:49:14,260 --> 00:49:15,010
it filled the toilet

1425
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:19,600
but i don't mind like trying to

1426
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:21,160
learn me like that where and especially

1427
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:21,910
when i know it's gonna come in

1428
00:49:21,910 --> 00:49:22,660
handy a lot like i know how

1429
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:24,580
to like change the ball thing in

1430
00:49:24,580 --> 00:49:26,980
the toilet and all machine to mow

1431
00:49:27,010 --> 00:49:29,290
thing in the toilet and now you're

1432
00:49:29,290 --> 00:49:31,630
looking for it i know my my

1433
00:49:31,870 --> 00:49:32,980
my dad used to have a job

1434
00:49:32,980 --> 00:49:34,870
where he flew helicopters for a guy

1435
00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:36,100
oh

1436
00:49:36,490 --> 00:49:38,560
so um forgot who what who ran

1437
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:40,600
a company he was the ceo we

1438
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:42,520
know what to say

1439
00:49:42,763 --> 00:49:43,810
was his name oliver

1440
00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:47,230
he had this great company with great

1441
00:49:47,230 --> 00:49:49,210
personalities everyone had a really good personnel

1442
00:49:49,990 --> 00:49:52,420
know but he's so in and his

1443
00:49:52,420 --> 00:49:56,770
thing was he would fly a guy

1444
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:00,340
to ah he would he would fly

1445
00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:02,260
from the from the building the corporate

1446
00:50:02,260 --> 00:50:04,240
office and he would fly him to

1447
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:05,080
like another sip

1448
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:08,318
eighty that was only like a la

1449
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:09,660
ballet and it was just a half

1450
00:50:09,679 --> 00:50:12,370
hour away but it was but it

1451
00:50:12,370 --> 00:50:14,680
was like ten minutes instead of half

1452
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:16,270
an hour for him to drive and

1453
00:50:16,270 --> 00:50:18,580
yeah that doesn't seem worth it to

1454
00:50:18,580 --> 00:50:19,990
me and he was like button but

1455
00:50:20,140 --> 00:50:21,880
for that guy it's worth it because

1456
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:23,800
those twenty minutes that he could be

1457
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:25,180
working and making money

1458
00:50:25,810 --> 00:50:28,266
he would rather pay the yeah that

1459
00:50:28,266 --> 00:50:31,090
was really kind of real because yeah

1460
00:50:31,510 --> 00:50:33,160
it just seems like a weird flex

1461
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:35,680
like real housewives will fly from o

1462
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:38,470
c to l a for like an

1463
00:50:38,470 --> 00:50:40,749
episode gonna helicopter like we'll make jokes

1464
00:50:40,749 --> 00:50:42,790
sometimes about like flying from burbank to

1465
00:50:42,790 --> 00:50:45,190

anything more hellish why don't you hate

1515
00:52:36,790 --> 00:52:38,560

you said that and the idea of

1517
00:52:40,030 --> 00:52:41,020
pot to my mind of what it

1518
00:52:41,020 --> 00:52:43,210
would be like to be just like

1519
00:52:43,210 --> 00:52:45,430
in your own home with some camera

1520
00:52:45,430 --> 00:52:47,920
crew there yeah it sounds so

1521
00:52:47,950 --> 00:52:49,390
weird when you really think about doing

1522
00:52:49,390 --> 00:52:51,730

00:54:11,650 --> 00:54:13,090

1569
00:54:19,540 --> 00:54:20,230
be right back

1570
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:25,690
and we're back well now it's time

1571
00:54:25,690 --> 00:54:27,250
for the part that everybody loves the

1572
00:54:27,250 --> 00:54:29,080
most it's the three true section this

1573
00:54:29,080 --> 00:54:30,010
is the part of the show where

1574
00:54:30,010 --> 00:54:32,200
we all play a game this is

1575
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:33,430
a game that was sent to us

1576
00:54:33,430 --> 00:54:35,320
by i don't know who and it

1577
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:35,770
was called

1578
00:54:37,390 --> 00:54:41,320
celebrity impressions couples therapy each person writes

1579
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:42,460
down the name of a celebrity and

1580
00:54:42,460 --> 00:54:44,860
passes it to their left then the

1581
00:54:44,860 --> 00:54:46,000
three people begin a scene in a

1582
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,220
therapist's office where one person chosen at

1583
00:54:48,220 --> 00:54:49,630
random is the therapist the other two

1584
00:54:49,630 --> 00:54:51,010
are a couple with a dispute and

1585
00:54:51,010 --> 00:54:53,110
issue resolved they play the scene as

1586
00:54:53,110 --> 00:54:54,880
the celebrity they've been passed now we

1587
00:54:54,910 --> 00:54:56,890
think the best way to do this

1588
00:54:58,420 --> 00:55:00,460
is for one person to be the

1589
00:55:00,460 --> 00:55:01,990
therapist and the other to a sinus

1590
00:55:01,990 --> 00:55:03,370
celebrity to each other and then the

1591
00:55:03,370 --> 00:55:05,740
therapist to guess who yeah they are

1592
00:55:06,220 --> 00:55:07,870
so tall and i paul and i

1593
00:55:07,870 --> 00:55:10,030
will be the couple and we're going

1594
00:55:10,030 --> 00:55:11,170
to text each other

1595
00:55:12,430 --> 00:55:14,290
who we are right so right now

1596
00:55:14,290 --> 00:55:15,460
and then lauren you're going to have

1597
00:55:15,460 --> 00:55:17,770
to guess who we are we have

1598
00:55:17,770 --> 00:55:20,590
each other's phone numbers we did we

1599
00:55:20,590 --> 00:55:22,930
don't like to brag about this but

1600
00:55:23,140 --> 00:55:24,220
and by the way paul you have

1601
00:55:24,220 --> 00:55:25,870

1607
00:55:36,453 --> 00:55:37,720

1615
00:55:55,930 --> 00:55:57,310

1616
00:55:57,310 --> 00:55:58,930

i

1797
01:02:23,660 --> 01:02:25,362
i'm a bit of a loose cannon

1798
01:02:25,385 --> 01:02:27,770
i guess you could say and you

1799
01:02:27,770 --> 01:02:30,770
know like i um i tend to

1800
01:02:30,770 --> 01:02:33,950
not be aware of my own presence

1801
01:02:33,950 --> 01:02:35,120
you know like i don't know i'm

1802
01:02:35,120 --> 01:02:35,930
just like a bull in a china

1803
01:02:35,930 --> 01:02:37,873
shop sometimes vary see at least you

1804
01:02:37,873 --> 01:02:40,640
have some understanding so i awareness that's

1805
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:42,440
good so so so you have no

1806
01:02:42,440 --> 01:02:43,460
self-awareness

1807
01:02:43,970 --> 01:02:45,410
and in your bullet edge and so

1808
01:02:45,410 --> 01:02:46,820
and so you think the rules that

1809
01:02:47,180 --> 01:02:49,280
she sets down for you are valid

1810
01:02:50,120 --> 01:02:52,190

2026
01:10:52,760 --> 01:10:54,860
terrible fear of the water um not

2027
01:10:54,860 --> 01:10:56,450
just when you train of any water

2028
01:10:56,450 --> 01:10:57,500
with those things in it that can

2029
01:10:57,500 --> 01:10:59,390
get me but aren't you afraid that

2030
01:10:59,390 --> 01:11:00,710
maybe there's like something that would happen

2031
01:11:00,713 --> 01:11:02,000
to your body when you're going under

2032
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:03,380

2034
01:11:05,795 --> 01:11:06,245
yeah

2035
01:11:08,045 --> 01:11:09,275

2039
01:11:17,975 --> 01:11:19,595
air supply if it started to run

01:11:19,595 --> 01:11:20,585

2044
01:11:26,405 --> 01:11:26,765
wo

2045
01:11:28,175 --> 01:11:30,125

01:11:30,125 --> 01:11:31,415
also you do here's the other here's

2047
01:11:31,415 --> 01:11:32,795
the other problem i mean here's the

2048
