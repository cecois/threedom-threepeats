137
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:23,160
different interpretation millennials think a selfie

138
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:26,460
gen x called the old man

139
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:32,100
but i i've never thought of myself

140
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:34,620
as a glasses person necessarily but i

141
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:35,520
got them and they were like yeah

142
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,720
you should wear these everyday i was

143
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,710
like that with black chicks

144
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:44,049
ah robert de niro oh robert

145
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:51,240
um you know my prescription is so

146
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:51,960
bad

147
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:57,000
how bad is ah she gestured to

148
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,200
us like aren't you gonna follow this

149
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,480
up bad is that i feel but

150
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:02,250
i can't really wear my glasses when

151
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:03,330
i go out in the world because

152
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,980
a they magnify my face in a

153
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:07,800
weird way and b i can't see

154
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,720
peripherally and so it's very stressful i

155
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,940
got more tired when do you wear

156
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:13,170
it then just run home

157
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,130
like when i go to like when

158
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:15,570
i'm done for the day when nothing's

159
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:16,770
going to sneak up on yeah and

160
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:18,270
you're approved for oh yeah on wow

161
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,010
when i'm are you are you like

162
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:21,120
a blind person where you know the

163
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,620
steps of how to get around yeah

164
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:24,750
and i really do i can do

165
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:26,820
a lot i can actually remember where

166
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,380
i put something and then grab it

167
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:31,140
like but i can't see she's she's

168
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:33,360
moving this out staring blankly

169
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:34,980
as if she's portraying a blind person

170
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:37,374
in a movie yeah and grab something

171
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:40,321
like ideal food to someone watching me

172
00:06:40,321 --> 00:06:41,370
i might look like i know what

173
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:43,380
i'm doing but i'm actually going i

174
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:44,700
think my glasses over there then i

175
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:46,830
like doom and then they are wow

176
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:49,890
it's really that much yeah but just

177
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:51,660
a blur yeah so you're you had

178
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:53,130
to be like damn you can't see

179
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:55,040
us right now basically i have contacts

180
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:56,730
oh i didn't know that ticks down

181
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:58,470
wow would i ever do anything like

182
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:00,030
if i was i wouldn't see your

183
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:02,430
prescription movie says right now your prescription

184
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:04,470
is bad enough but for the context

185
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:06,480
you can see peripherally is that okay

186
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:07,590
because they cover the

483
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:11,990
the spotlight yeah that's what i always

said i'm ready to play they both

485
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:15,170
met in this acting class and then

he was cheating on his fiance with

487
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:18,380
her whenever it's hot and then she

488
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:20,000
goes missing it's pretty odd so basically

489
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,090
the police are on the hunt you

490
00:18:23,090 --> 00:18:24,980
know they're on the case but they

491
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:26,420
don't really get that thorough with it

492
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:28,790
and this journalist who's making the podcast

493
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,380
goes out of his way

494
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:31,370
way to like work with a private

495
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:33,980
investigator to try to solve the mystery

496
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:36,560
and he called it he does yeah

497
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,750
and it's spots um well no i'm

498
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:39,860
not telling you what this what the

499
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:42,380
dude takes many twists and turns but

500
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:43,820
it's spot i'm not going to tell

501
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:45,650
you what happens is this guy truly

502
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,420
neil strauss thing i don't know what

503
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:49,970
that is is he did he nor

504
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:50,540
laura dope

505
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:52,400
play dough did he killer who is

506
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:55,640
neil's house was the guy who um

507
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:58,340
wrote that book the game about oh

508
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:00,350
yeah this reason oh the thing that

509
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:02,780
idea oh the game yeah yeah yeah

510
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:03,830
but no anyway

511
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:07,880
every day there was a show i

512
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:11,030
was told about ah an argument that

513
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:13,490
happened in a text thread where people

514
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:16,190
were bagging on neil strauss the author

515
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:18,290
of the game and then someone thought

516
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,120
that it was the the movie the

517
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:22,250
game like why are we so bad

518
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:23,840
at writing the game

519
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,980
yeah i liked that movie wow neil

520
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:31,340
strauss's a murderer that's so not not

521
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:34,250
that's not right but anyway investigators listen

522
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,740
do you like stuff like that i

523
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:38,870
don't typically i barely like listening to

524
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:40,940
you talk about well i'm not as

525
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:43,100
interesting as the honestly i feel like

526
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,750
serial turned me off

527
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:46,610
to those kinds of but here's the

528
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:47,690
two things that i've listened to in

529
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:50,030
that vein yeah serial which was so

530
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:51,562
disappointing i know that was such a

531
00:19:51,562 --> 00:19:53,360
bummer this one's not just pointing early

532
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:55,100
where it's like when they kind of

533
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,450
realised they weren't gonna wrap it up

534
00:19:56,450 --> 00:19:58,160
and they're like i think also on

535
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,570
the third episode they were asking for

536
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:02,030

537
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:04,426
other one was you must away with

presence yes and present so an equal

544
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:18,560

00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,700
one of us will murder one of

546
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:22,250
the other people who would you murder

the the host has ah ah ah

568
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:21,700
ah ah sort of peculiar way of

569
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:25,660
speaking she over enunciate as i've sometimes

570
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,700
and then sometimes not like there are

571
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:30,460
certain things that she says to crisply

572
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:32,050
and clearly like no one says that

573
00:21:32,050 --> 00:21:33,760
word that very often sounds like it's

574
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,160
take fourteen yes but then she also

575
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,570
kept saying unfortunately

576
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:40,390
ah she she does a ah d's

577
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:42,940

00:36:22,045 --> 00:36:23,035
most i think it was yours paul

974
00:36:23,035 --> 00:36:24,415
actually mindsets

975
00:36:24,475 --> 00:36:26,695

979
00:36:32,485 --> 00:36:33,955

981
00:36:37,255 --> 00:36:39,865
randomly wakes up and starts talking to

00:36:39,865 --> 00:36:41,695
me not based on anything that i've

983
00:36:41,695 --> 00:36:43,495
said so if you know that why

984
00:36:43,495 --> 00:36:45,055

yeah we didn't know he's gonna do

1015
00:37:51,775 --> 00:37:53,095
that we thought he was just going

1016
00:37:53,095 --> 00:37:54,175
to trim it and then he'd just

1017
00:37:54,175 --> 00:37:54,445
remove

1018
00:37:54,475 --> 00:37:57,805
the whole thing and um i said

1019
00:37:57,835 --> 00:37:59,425
i'll call the landlord to find out

1020
00:37:59,995 --> 00:38:01,495
before we do anything i'll find out

1021
00:38:01,495 --> 00:38:02,665

people that there would be a charge

1077
00:39:41,845 --> 00:39:44,215
on this or that or whatever and

1078
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:45,535
i was like all i'm asking for

1080
00:39:47,545 --> 00:39:47,905

it's worded is bad and doesn't it

1082
00:39:50,305 --> 00:39:51,775

00:40:53,135 --> 00:40:54,425
off all the time no

1114
00:40:55,865 --> 00:40:57,095

off that i'll put up with ram

1116
00:40:58,805 --> 00:41:00,305

1120
00:41:06,665 --> 00:41:08,105

1122
00:41:09,755 --> 00:41:12,185

1126
00:41:19,415 --> 00:41:21,605
this because they weren't taking care of

1127
00:41:21,605 --> 00:41:23,135
it and the city comes down on

1128
00:41:23,135 --> 00:41:24,365
me and the city made me do

1129
00:41:24,365 --> 00:41:25,535
it and you know all they have

1130
00:41:25,535 --> 00:41:27,155
nothing better to do than just harass

00:41:27,155 --> 00:41:29,105
people you know all the shit and

1132
00:41:29,105 --> 00:41:30,215
it's like you know i wanted to

1133
00:41:30,215 --> 00:41:31,925
take more down but then i ran

1134
00:41:31,925 --> 00:41:33,215

whatever this guy actually owe a huge

1139
00:41:39,935 --> 00:41:41,975
hearing you should look for reminding me

00:41:41,975 --> 00:41:43,265
have somebody to live and die anyway

1141
00:41:43,415 --> 00:41:45,155
but since it's so fun is when

1142
00:41:45,155 --> 00:41:47,615
somebody's like interrogating people and you hear

1143
00:41:47,615 --> 00:41:50,615

you know split the cost of that

1170
00:42:30,515 --> 00:42:32,195

one of those things where it's like

1175
00:42:38,315 --> 00:42:41,105

make ah a point about my landlord

1432
00:51:19,390 --> 00:51:20,590
yeah because i the way i told

1433
00:51:20,590 --> 00:51:21,850
the clerk i made it sound as

1434
00:51:21,850 --> 00:51:24,430
though she liked that i was on

1435
00:51:24,430 --> 00:51:25,690
a tv show and then she overcharged

1436
00:51:25,690 --> 00:51:27,580
me she also that's exactly what it

1437
00:51:27,580 --> 00:51:29,350
sounds like you're really she turned on

1438
00:51:29,350 --> 00:51:31,450
me two other times so i knew

1439
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:31,600
nah

1440
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:33,580
not to fight this situation wait how

1441
00:51:33,580 --> 00:51:35,200
does she turn on well one time

1442
00:51:35,230 --> 00:51:36,520
i was late with my rent by

1443
00:51:36,550 --> 00:51:38,170
a day i'd never been late so

1444
00:51:38,170 --> 00:51:39,970
whereas the sixth or the second it

1445
00:51:39,970 --> 00:51:41,920
was this the first i think my

1446
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:43,120
check hadn't come yet or the second

1447
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:44,860
maybe but i totally spaced on it

1448
00:51:44,860 --> 00:51:46,060
for some reason and then she like

1449
00:51:46,150 --> 00:51:47,830
got so mean and she made me

1450
00:51:47,830 --> 00:51:49,000
send it same day even though i'm

1451
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:50,650
like i knew she didn't like i

1452
00:51:50,650 --> 00:51:51,670
knew first of all i'm

1453
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:53,683
trustworthy i'm always on time or earlier

1454
00:51:53,683 --> 00:51:56,590
with my rent and secondly i knew

1455
00:51:56,590 --> 00:51:58,210
it wasn't like she's gonna go under

1456
00:51:58,210 --> 00:51:59,380
if she doesn't get it now you

1457
00:51:59,380 --> 00:52:00,400
know i mean i didn't own the

1458
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:02,200
place or was she she did but

1459
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:04,540
she was very not understanding like any

1460
00:52:04,540 --> 00:52:07,180
problem that i had right um and

1461
00:52:07,180 --> 00:52:09,070

1462
00:52:09,070 --> 00:52:10,210
i was trying to get fixed my

1463
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:11,740
point is when i got the bill

1464
00:52:11,740 --> 00:52:11,890
from

00:52:14,020 --> 00:52:15,760
sense because i know that she's logical

00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:17,290
when she is on her high horse

1469
00:52:17,350 --> 00:52:18,670

by her i would be on her

1473
00:52:22,030 --> 00:52:23,290

leaving and i was late wind my

1482
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:41,620
way you're lazy when you were leaving

1483
00:52:41,770 --> 00:52:42,820
my point is i didn't go around

1484
00:52:42,820 --> 00:52:44,650
filling every hole and taking off that

1485
00:52:44,650 --> 00:52:46,330
plate and replacing me i would never

1486
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:48,100
do that by the way like i

1487
00:52:48,130 --> 00:52:50,170
don't think i've ever left an apartment

1488
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:51,790
in the shape that i got it

1489
00:52:51,790 --> 00:52:52,900

00:52:56,110 --> 00:52:57,130
pause that and it pisses me off

1493
00:52:57,130 --> 00:52:58,270
when i don't get it because i

00:54:40,930 --> 00:54:42,580
circle or establish a clear are we

1546
00:54:42,580 --> 00:54:44,020
sitting in a circle or a triangle

1547
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:46,780
or in a circle around a triangle

1548
00:54:46,810 --> 00:54:48,700

song then proceed to tell a story

1551
00:54:53,650 --> 00:54:55,420
with each person saying one sentence at

1552
00:54:55,420 --> 00:54:57,760
a time here's the catch each sentence

1553
00:54:57,760 --> 00:54:59,680
must start with either ginny

1554
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:01,720
good work can seem so straightforward i

1555
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:04,000
was so into it or unfortunately always

1556
00:55:04,060 --> 00:55:05,590
alternating yep

1557
00:55:06,340 --> 00:55:09,610
so lauren start us off with just

1558
00:55:09,610 --> 00:55:11,350
a sentence it doesn't have to be

1559
00:55:11,620 --> 00:55:12,640
the first one doesn't have to be

1560
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:14,740
fortunately or unfortunately i was just ah

1561
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:16,510

1564
00:55:20,770 --> 00:55:21,070
head

1565
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:26,500
from the twisted mind of lower leg

1566
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:29,260
guests fortunately pitch perfect was on tv

1567
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:34,000
unfortunately it was at the very end

1568
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:38,200
and the credits started rolling fortunately the

1569
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:40,330
credits led me to a name of

1570
00:55:40,330 --> 00:55:42,040
the woman that i ended up marrying

1571
00:55:42,550 --> 00:55:45,880
unfortunately she wasn't in on getting married

1572
00:55:45,880 --> 00:55:47,140
to me i married her while she

1573
00:55:47,140 --> 00:55:50,560
was asleep fortunately when she woke

1574
00:55:50,590 --> 00:55:52,900
up she asked me to marry her

1575
00:55:52,930 --> 00:55:57,160
not realizing we were already married unfortunately

1576
00:55:57,430 --> 00:55:59,860
she died the minute that the period

1577
00:55:59,860 --> 00:56:02,680
of her sentence came out where she

1578
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:06,400
said will you marry me mr oh

1579
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:08,470
that's great that you said yes the

1580
00:56:08,470 --> 00:56:10,720
period at the end of that fortunately

1581
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:13,150
the because her sentence didn't make any

1582
00:56:13,150 --> 00:56:15,430
sense i was arrested

1583
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:18,040
well that's fortunate

1584
00:56:20,410 --> 00:56:20,950

you're done unfortunately unfortunately i remained arrested

1586
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:31,780
for a while after that fortunately when

1587
00:56:31,780 --> 00:56:34,240
i got out eighty years later

1588
00:56:36,100 --> 00:56:39,520
i found an apple on the street

1589
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:41,380
that someone had discarded it only had

1590
00:56:41,380 --> 00:56:43,630

1591
00:56:43,630 --> 00:56:45,580
two worms in it and they bit

1592
00:56:45,580 --> 00:56:49,000
