discern the theme of our show every

91
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,490
episode as a theme that we decide

92
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:23,130
on previous to it like weeks before

93
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,350
weeks before and we talk about things

94
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:26,670
that relate to the theme but no

95
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:27,810
one is able to guess the theme

96
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:29,070
after the episode so you know it's

97
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:29,970
weird we've done it

98
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,800
over one hundred episodes now no one

99
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,050

00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,390
yeah we've got and let's look at

101
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:37,650
some of the guesses from last week

102
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:39,480
oh look at this um charles from

103
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:42,840
lake charles oh interesting says humanity is

104
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,060
the theme it's like i mean it's

105
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:47,100
a little grandiose ones yeah theory from

106
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:50,010
lake superior we because the theme is

107
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:50,400
ch

108
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,680

one's from huron from lake huron yeah

114
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:05,910
well they say that we should make

115
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:08,370
the show more about something deeper it's

116
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:10,560
not even a guess it's just so

117
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:15,120
things cheaper something more intense something that

118
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,460
would really change the way the world

119
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:20,190
turns the topic should be colon

120
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:23,130

the erie from like gary yeah it's

134
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,780
a little spooky there's a drawing of

135
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:57,540
a ghost and it says the theme

136
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:00,120
of the show is people who were

137
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:06,030
born once once so non-christians worn once

138
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:09,180
i got my hands leaves out i

139
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:10,800
guess anyone is reincarnated

140
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:14,280
yeah i like the theme guys should

141
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,840
we do it are there people who

142
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,900
aren't reincarnated like do you only get

143
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:22,080
reincarnated if you believe in reincarnation yeah

144
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,280
you know what i mean like you

145
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,480
only go to heaven if you believe

146
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,470
in hell yeah i don't think that

147
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:27,090
makes sense i think if something really

148
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:28,530
is real it should just happen no

149
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:30,960
matter what you believe yeah i think

150
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,550
like heaven if heaven is real and

151
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:33,750
you don't believe in it i think

152
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,760
you should still go to heaven and

153
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,050
like a look around i think it's

154
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:39,210
okay if you get made fun of

155
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:40,830
a little bit yeah go look at

156
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:43,320
this guy likely living well believing yeah

157
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:45,840
how's do you believe in us now

158
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,850
and that can last for one full

159
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:49,680
earth year yeah which will be like

160
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,000
nothing in heaven it's oh yeah

161
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:53,490
a minute because honestly it's eternity that

162
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:54,960
you're there yeah yeah so it's like

163
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,250
you can you can take that for

164
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:57,840
a year you have to be if

165
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,460
you're not good natured about that if

166
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:01,050
you go to block you you gotta

167
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:04,710

179
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,810
because there any unanswered question it's on

180
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:29,820
my mind oh we just talk about

181
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:32,097

184
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,770
there's gotta be people from history that

185
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:39,120
you'd be like this is the old

186
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,170

the only coverage to be continued

324
00:11:12,615 --> 00:11:13,875
do you know what to think because

325
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:15,435
we know people that have written books

326
00:11:15,435 --> 00:11:18,375

highway of two cities st jane ayers

00:11:26,385 --> 00:11:28,305
if you write a bow it's huh

331
00:11:28,515 --> 00:11:30,045
if you are like a humorous book

332
00:11:30,045 --> 00:11:32,415
now like whether it's a humorous memoir

333
00:11:32,415 --> 00:11:35,235
or humorous guide to or whatever the

334
00:11:35,235 --> 00:11:37,755
book has to have an impossibly long

335
00:11:37,785 --> 00:11:39,405
title yeah to explain what you read

336
00:11:39,435 --> 00:11:41,205
i do think the long titles are

337
00:11:41,205 --> 00:11:43,215
too much sometimes it's stupid but they

338
00:11:43,215 --> 00:11:44,505
make you do it yeah

339
00:11:44,505 --> 00:11:46,065
yeah they make you do it it's

340
00:11:46,065 --> 00:11:48,135
so weird here's why you should read

341
00:11:48,135 --> 00:11:50,595
this nobody's book yeah why why don't

342
00:11:50,595 --> 00:11:52,305

343
00:11:52,305 --> 00:11:53,745

563
00:19:13,875 --> 00:19:15,645

we're gonna put a fence around a

584
00:19:46,485 --> 00:19:47,535

we're supposed to be advocates for their

588
00:19:51,675 --> 00:19:53,445
neighbors of what they wouldn't want so

589
00:19:53,445 --> 00:19:54,405
a lot of times they go like

590
00:19:54,405 --> 00:19:55,603
what are the colors you hate and

591
00:19:55,603 --> 00:19:57,375
they go brown and they go okay

00:19:57,375 --> 00:19:58,725
nothing but just make sure there's nothing

593
00:19:58,725 --> 00:20:00,255
brown then the designer would come and

594
00:20:00,255 --> 00:20:01,815
go like i'm doing the whole thing

595
00:20:01,815 --> 00:20:03,495
brown it really would be in the

596
00:20:03,495 --> 00:20:04,939
whole room would be like brown and

597
00:20:04,939 --> 00:20:06,405
that's able to be like okay you're

598
00:20:06,405 --> 00:20:08,115

602
00:20:11,625 --> 00:20:12,945
i'm still doing it sometimes they would

603
00:20:12,945 --> 00:20:13,965
compromise now and then at the end

604
00:20:13,965 --> 00:20:14,938
that people would come back and go

605
00:20:14,938 --> 00:20:17,385
and cry and cry like it looked

606
00:20:17,385 --> 00:20:19,305

great show if you like homemakers they

take a call the second and middle

629
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:01,780
of nowhere and all the houses are

630
00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:03,940
brand new construction and they give them

631
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:05,590
to all these designing given to designers

632
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:06,730
and they each do their own house

633
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:08,200
with their own with an aid and

634
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,570
greatest oh isn't there always a cul-de-sac

635
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:11,320
ah basis

636
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,490
really it's just a street of new

637
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:13,900
house every once in a while they'll

638
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:15,850
do it a street that goes all

639
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:17,200
the way through to an okay i'll

640
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,450
do that too but it's just each

641
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:21,040
designer does their own a team of

642
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,564
designers says their own house and they

643
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,730
obviously make different choices and then there's

644
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:27,100
a lonely process on each episode of

645
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:28,690
like working the kitchen today than one

646
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:30,640
person wins the kitchen competition you know

647
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:31,480
all this kind of stuff

648
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,590
tough and then at the end they

649
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:35,470
sell the homes my block ends in

650
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:36,610
a dead end is a dead end

651
00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:38,620

807
00:26:54,130 --> 00:26:55,300
parts to it and she goes no

809
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,960
first time that i noticed steve agee

because he was dancing off in the

820
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:17,320
background the worst is when

821
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,700
if somebody interrupts you with something like

822
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:20,380
that where you clearly were going to

823
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:21,730

824
00:27:21,730 --> 00:27:24,580

if you met him in character if

890
00:29:33,310 --> 00:29:34,330
he was daniel plainview

891
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:37,720
if i were in micah mr prescott

892
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:39,070
like i mean don't you remember people

00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:42,340
you've done things with scenes i you

894
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:43,630
know what though the older i get

895
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:45,460
yeah and the more things that i

896
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:48,103
do yeah it's harder to remember i

897
00:29:48,103 --> 00:29:50,470
put holdings but don't worry it's happening

898
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:51,940
i've had people

899
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:54,370
i've had people now we've opened up

900
00:29:54,370 --> 00:29:55,630
a new genre of joking with each

901
00:29:55,630 --> 00:29:57,670
other i'm glad to hear um we're

902
00:29:57,670 --> 00:30:00,130
both in this idler but i'm not

903
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:01,180
getting invited to the big slick to

904
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:03,490
be bad at softball presumably five years

905
00:30:03,490 --> 00:30:05,440
ago when i teach ah there you

906
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:08,200
go yeah um i guys play softball

907
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,670
i've worked with people where they have

908
00:30:09,670 --> 00:30:11,830
said we worked together on this thing

909
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,240
you know however many years ago

910
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:15,910
oh sometimes i'll remember sometimes it depends

911
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:17,020
on true but i guess i just

912
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:18,970
think of that movie as being so

913
00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:20,320
important to his career that he would

914
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,190
have seen it like a lot of

915
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:22,540
times maybe that's not true i'd bet

916
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:24,310
he never saw it never yeah but

917
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:25,120
even if he's seen a lot of

918
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,320
times you could barely see me in

919
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,390
it i'm i'm like out-of-focus when you

920
00:30:28,390 --> 00:30:30,280
can see me and then when i'm

921
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:31,960
when i have my lines i'm running

922
00:30:32,170 --> 00:30:33,370
in silhouette i gotta

923
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,010
your scenes yeah they're very easy to

924
00:30:36,010 --> 00:30:37,930
fuck it's one thing i gotta look

925
00:30:37,930 --> 00:30:38,860
it up and very easy to find

926
00:30:39,190 --> 00:30:41,110
i'm gonna do that oh that's fun

927
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:42,233
i shouldn't be in that movie it's

928
00:30:42,445 --> 00:30:44,830
that's great that is never cool i

929
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:45,910
bet he's never seen it because i

930
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:47,530
i'm due a talkback after it once

931
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:50,500
and he seemed just mortified that he

932
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:52,690
had to talk about this but i

933
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:54,160
think that's him anyway right yeah

934
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:55,603
but i bet he's just like ah

935
00:30:55,603 --> 00:30:56,830
i don't even want to talk about

936
00:30:56,830 --> 00:30:59,506
this or watching or anything yeah and

937
00:30:59,506 --> 00:31:01,960
i understand yeah maybe he thought it

938
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:04,510
was a different movie yeah because like

939
00:31:04,510 --> 00:31:05,920
we're still talking about my left foot

940
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:07,930
i all these years later i remember

941
00:31:07,930 --> 00:31:11,650
hearing that he thought when he made

942
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:13,750
a gangs of new york with scorsese

943
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:13,990
that

944
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,670
the original idea was this is gonna

945
00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:16,960
be like kind of a comedy like

946
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,250
we're gonna go this is gonna be

947
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:20,350
like in bra crazy movie yes like

948
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:21,610
dumb and dumber said but then it

949
00:31:21,610 --> 00:31:23,860
became like a like a serious oscar

950
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:26,440
bait drama kind of thing and that

951
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:28,030
it kind of ruined it for him

952
00:31:28,690 --> 00:31:30,670
because he gave a different performance than

953
00:31:30,670 --> 00:31:32,230
what he he was geared up to

954
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:33,790
give a different performance i think he's

955
00:31:33,910 --> 00:31:34,450
i think he's

956
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,800
probably still get the same performance yeah

957
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:37,480
because yeah pretty big what he's doing

958
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:39,729
it's plenty big so i might have

959
00:31:39,729 --> 00:31:41,650
been disappointed in the movie i see

960
00:31:43,330 --> 00:31:44,770
i know you seem you guys you

961
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,930

he totally changed his body into a

968
00:31:58,510 --> 00:32:00,070

00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,650
was no because i was like he's

985
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,920

just lost all patients for up to

1024
00:33:39,610 --> 00:33:42,340
people like that i could do a

1025
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:43,240
one hundred and fifty

1026
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:46,150
it's a lot i think i could

1027
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:48,550
do two weeks i could do i

1028
00:33:48,550 --> 00:33:50,260
could do like time talks well like

1029
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:53,200
before actually internally got upset wouldn't be

1030
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,430
that long but i could make it

1031
00:33:54,430 --> 00:33:56,290
last for a long oh before anyone

1032
00:33:56,290 --> 00:33:57,550
would know that i was even if

1033
00:33:57,550 --> 00:33:59,170
you weren't paid anything you'll know what

1034
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:01,090
he buys it free because you love

1035
00:34:01,090 --> 00:34:02,350
it so i want to be paid

1036
00:34:02,470 --> 00:34:04,480
handsomely i wonder

1037
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,650
or how long i could do any

1038
00:34:05,650 --> 00:34:07,510
kind of tv show before i didn't

1039
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:08,320
want to do it anymore

1040
00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:11,860
i've heard some people say i go

1041
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:13,150
wow that show must be so fun

1042
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:14,890
you're doing eight seasons they go no

1043
00:34:14,890 --> 00:34:16,990
playing one character for eight years sucks

1044
00:34:16,990 --> 00:34:18,790
so bad yeah i mean i'll say

1045
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:20,020
that but it's also like i think

1046
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:21,910
it'll shut up section expands on the

1047
00:34:21,910 --> 00:34:25,060
character playing different or your characters and

1048
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:27,220
like that's called it's just your own

1049
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:29,200
person here and a great sich

1050
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,270
duration for many years yeah i would

1051
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:32,560
think yeah it would depend on the

1052
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,600
individual project but i i feel like

1053
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:36,310
because the the the longest i've ever

1054
00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:39,430
done anything was spontaneous nation where that

1055
00:34:39,430 --> 00:34:40,840
was a weekly thing yeah and i

1056
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,760
did it for one hundred episodes yeah

1057
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:45,820
right and like like the last the

1058
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:47,110
last year was sort of like

1059
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:50,320
i don't i feel like this it

1060
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,960
feels same to me even though yeah

1061
00:34:52,990 --> 00:34:55,000
the content is different every time but

1062
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,500
the structure of it was the same

1063
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:58,150
to me and i yeah i got

1064
00:34:58,150 --> 00:34:59,890
tired of doing that same structure things

1065
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:01,450
kind of run their course in that

1066
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:03,250
er yeah telling us you don't want

1067
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:05,260
to do this anymore know this but

1068
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:06,820
this is a different thing because it's

1069
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:08,320
not because just ca

1070
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,510
every station right you know what if

1071
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:11,590
we were like we don't want to

1072
00:35:11,590 --> 00:35:12,640
have conversations anymore

1073
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:15,015
it's not my thing anymore no i

1074
00:35:15,015 --> 00:35:16,420

really what babies do that it's so

1085
00:35:39,610 --> 00:35:41,560
funny like what are they what do

1086
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:43,086

00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:45,070
i yeah i know that i know

some ass when when she's eating oh

1114
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:40,000
just kissing over and over what she's

1115
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,940
doing yes yeah you're eating yeah that's

1116
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:45,970
a spoon spoon spoon do you do

1128
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:09,160
we even using the spoon the foods

1129
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:09,280

to the highchair and she was i

1139
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,220
let her have the bowl with the

1140
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,690
puree in it and then she was

1141
00:37:28,690 --> 00:37:29,440
just co

1142
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,700

00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:33,280
it was within thirty seconds i mean

1144
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,750
it was like she was just eating

1145
00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:35,560
and then i looked over and she

1146
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:36,760
just had it all what if we

1147
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,590

1148
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:40,000
to you go to a restaurant on

1149
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,580
your forehead i know so and that's

1150
00:37:42,730 --> 00:37:44,200
like a compliment to the code yeah

1151
00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:45,610
good way can we talk to the

1152
00:37:45,610 --> 00:37:47,260
chef i just wanna say food oh

1153
00:37:47,266 --> 00:37:49,540
my face is covered with your theirs

1154
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:51,730
so this technique called baby led weaning

1155
00:37:51,790 --> 00:37:54,040
that i'm leaving like we're ready baby

1156
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:57,459
baby baby baby led weaning so because

1157
00:37:57,459 --> 00:38:01,420
the baby you give them solids cut

1158
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:03,220
to appropriate size that's a

1159
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,270
and there's if anyone's curious about this

1160
00:38:07,270 --> 00:38:09,130
there's an instagram and a website called

1161
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:11,290
solid starts on the website you can

1162
00:38:11,290 --> 00:38:12,220
just type in a food and it

1163
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:13,180
tells you how to prepare it for

1164
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:15,040
their age range so like she's likes

1165
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,870
to what consistency yeah like yeah so

1166
00:38:16,870 --> 00:38:18,310
like so for example i want to

1167
00:38:18,310 --> 00:38:19,840
try giving i gave her a strawberry

1168
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:21,850
yesterday and today and she i just

1169
00:38:21,850 --> 00:38:23,020
cut the top off and she just

1170
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:24,400
held it and chomped it until

1171
00:38:24,430 --> 00:38:25,480
it was basically gone then i threw

1172
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:26,590
it away when it got a little

1173
00:38:26,590 --> 00:38:27,880
awkward of size and i was not

1174
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,620
sure about it okay but then with

1175
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:30,910
the i'm gonna give her a banana

1176
00:38:30,910 --> 00:38:32,530
today says to cut it either half

1177
00:38:32,530 --> 00:38:35,410
lengthwise horse sideways horizontally and then she

1178
00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:36,790
could just have hold that and chew

1179
00:38:36,790 --> 00:38:38,680
on it and then like you made

1180
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:40,394
me think of a banana split yeah

1181
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:42,250
that oh won't work but so it's

1182
00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:44,560
a technique that supposedly helps with

1183
00:38:44,650 --> 00:38:46,480
them not being picky eaters because they

1184
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:49,990
encounter a lot of textures and they

1185
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,760
interact with the food as a whole

1186
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,260
themselves so they're like familiar with what

1187
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:54,670
it is as opposed i get were

1188
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:56,590
curious too but as opposed to seeing

1189
00:38:56,590 --> 00:38:58,090
it as a puree you see role

1190
00:38:58,150 --> 00:38:59,531
object have you ever given her like

1191
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:01,030
license to do it it seems fun

1192
00:39:01,210 --> 00:39:02,560
have you ever given her like wasabi

1193
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,720
on a spoon as like um no

1194
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,130
no but ah but there was one

1195
00:39:06,130 --> 00:39:07,030
time that i went to i went

1196
00:39:07,030 --> 00:39:10,030
to a bachelor party in vegas um

1197
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:11,860
as the stripper with holly

1198
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,070

1199
00:39:15,070 --> 00:39:16,720

we had done not mushrooms we had

1203
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:28,210

1204
00:39:28,390 --> 00:39:30,730
but i had gotten pretty ripped off

1205
00:39:30,730 --> 00:39:32,410

1206
00:39:32,410 --> 00:39:33,010
sushi place and

1207

with how spicy own right and he

1220
00:39:56,110 --> 00:39:56,980

1221
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:58,660
was going crazy because it was so

1222
00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:00,610

1319
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:17,545
specific time in one's life you know

1320
00:43:17,550 --> 00:43:18,374
and this is where it was like

1321
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:20,756
when you're twenty five to thirty yeah

1322
00:43:20,820 --> 00:43:22,560
you see the same people all the

1323
00:43:22,620 --> 00:43:24,450
time all day every day yeah and

1324
00:43:24,450 --> 00:43:26,250
yeah so um we it was it

1325
00:43:26,250 --> 00:43:26,460
was

1326
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:28,050
dark out we went to judge the

1327
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:30,510
pumpkin carving contest and i remember it

1328
00:43:30,510 --> 00:43:31,770
was they had a pool and was

1329
00:43:31,770 --> 00:43:32,790
on the other side of the pool

1330
00:43:33,330 --> 00:43:34,710
and to go to get to the

1331
00:43:34,710 --> 00:43:36,630
pool i had to walk like past

1332
00:43:36,630 --> 00:43:39,330
this tree and this tree became just

1333
00:43:39,330 --> 00:43:42,540
a horrible forest like how do i

1334
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:46,170
get through these dead branches in reality

1335
00:43:46,170 --> 00:43:46,680
this tree is

1336
00:43:46,710 --> 00:43:47,700
like as big as this yeah it's

1337
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:50,310
like bronco round yeah and um then

1338
00:43:50,310 --> 00:43:51,180
we got there and we looked at

1339
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:54,000
the pumpkin's and um there were like

1340
00:43:54,030 --> 00:43:56,670
eight of them maybe more maybe there

1341
00:43:56,670 --> 00:43:59,820
were twelve and so ah if you

1342
00:43:59,850 --> 00:44:01,320
the way we judged them was we

1343
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:03,300
would go up to see jay and

1344
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:05,460
she was on drugs too and you

1345
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:06,840
had to say to her the nun

1346
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:08,670
under that you were voting for and

1347
00:44:08,670 --> 00:44:10,350
so rather than do like one through

1348
00:44:10,350 --> 00:44:11,880
twelve and then writing hash marks next

1349
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:13,710
to them or something she was just

1350
00:44:13,770 --> 00:44:16,110
writing the number whatever number somebody would

1351
00:44:16,110 --> 00:44:18,150
say to her so at one point

1352
00:44:18,870 --> 00:44:20,430
she she came up to me and

1353
00:44:20,430 --> 00:44:23,280
said look what i did and i

1354
00:44:23,370 --> 00:44:24,513
look at the piece of paper just

1355
00:44:24,513 --> 00:44:26,640
said all these random numbers and i

1356
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:26,970
was like

1357
00:44:27,030 --> 00:44:28,110
i can't look at that

1358
00:44:29,610 --> 00:44:31,470
and they're driving me crazy it was

1359
00:44:31,470 --> 00:44:34,170
so it chilled me to my core

1360
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:36,360
ah and then ah so whoever was

1361
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:39,180
the winner they figured it with a

1362
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:41,490
pencil about yeah and so had to

1363
00:44:41,490 --> 00:44:42,810
use that time and so then i

1364
00:44:42,810 --> 00:44:44,400
remember i think it was mark fight

1365
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,680

1366
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:48,330

that

1368
00:44:49,110 --> 00:44:51,420
their their pumpkins didn't get chosen and

1369
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:54,750
they started smashing the pumpkin's oh nancy

1370
00:44:54,750 --> 00:44:57,690

1372
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:02,070
thing that was like the end of

1373
00:45:02,070 --> 00:45:03,570
