red baron stuff is the most boring

59
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:32,730
stuff of course it is he's like

60
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:34,800
in a war you're like let's make

61
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,960

62
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:39,360

or whatever i'm talking about how boring

67
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,820
it like i watched the feel like

68
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:49,500
it was the thanksgiving special or something

69
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,510
and there's a whole long riff where

70
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:53,940
he's pretending to be it always bored

71
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:56,130
me to tears part of everything turning

72
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:57,420
you're in a war do you think

73
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,520
it was for the parents of

74
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,050
of the children at the time maybe

75
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:02,820
but it just shuts the plot down

76
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:04,440
like there's no plot moving forward it

77
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,720
sounds just like it's like dream sequences

78
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:09,240
charlie brown is the plot yeah let's

79
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:12,000
remove for intricate story i'm like is

80
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,670
the great pumpkin coming or not and

81
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:15,930

190
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:51,930
gist of it is that i like

191
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:52,320

all over the we wrote yeah it

220
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:54,360
was like mafia and i was like

221
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,160
i wrote it he said you didn't

222
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,450
approach me that you read the book

223
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:59,130

224
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:00,300
after that and say well look i

225
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,140

him i was like i did the

227
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:04,500
report what how i

228
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,540
wasn't vague i didn't know i had

229
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:09,360
this teacher once who's my journalism teacher

230
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,650
which makes you wonder why we're even

231
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:12,540
doing this project where we had to

232
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:14,250
um we all had to like i

233
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:15,510
guess what we had to report on

234
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:16,890
the grapes of wrath who you're just

235
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:19,260
but he assigned us like as groups

236
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:20,430
like a section of the book like

237
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:22,110
i just had to read channel par

238
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:23,730
as someone entering the end then we

239
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,690
each present are

240
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,100
a little motivated but it was like

241
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:27,930
i don't know what happened it was

242
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:29,640
like a horrible it made no sense

243
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,710
a bad assignment i'm trying yeah i'm

244
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:32,940
trying to figure it out from a

245
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:35,250
journalism angle i don't even know if

246
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:37,170
there was any connection freeing me back

247
00:08:37,170 --> 00:08:40,080
to peanuts from for my newspaper class

248
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:42,720
um there was an editorial about spanking

249
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,490
in school because it was still happening

250
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:44,880
at the time

251
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,050
and for some reason and i drew

252
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:48,540
a cartoon for it which was ah

253
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,880
charlie brown like bending over the table

254
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,610
being spanked and going good grief and

255
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:56,730
my and my ah journalism teacher like

256
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:57,750
held it up in front of the

257
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:59,610
class and said all right everyone what

258
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:02,790
is wrong with this and someone like

259
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:05,040
raise their hand said it's copy

260
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,410
righted and he went exactly there's no

261
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:08,850
way we can publish this in my

262
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,820
mind i'm going he's wrong and it

263
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,920
is wrong yeah like you clarity is

264
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,050
not yes the that's the whole the

265
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:17,280
whole point of it is you can

266
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,170
use copy it's fair you know just

267
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:21,480
made me so much true because thomas

268
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,700
nast the famous political cartoonist tool the

269
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,200
reason he driven one so fucked up

270
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,210
well he's so he wouldn't get sued

271
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:30,030
because they were originally who they're well

272
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:31,830
the bondi characters dagwood and blondie no

273
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:33,360
no no he would draw like boss

274
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,160
tweed but he would be it would

275
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,320
be a gross caricature so the boss

276
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:39,810
we couldn't sue oh wow he's like

277
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:41,490
because if you sue you to admit

278
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,560
it looks like you right right

279
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,260
yeah yeah yeah i'm that yes looking

280
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:48,960
yeah that's me obviously in the corner

281
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:52,733

like every place or whatever i feel

425
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:49,490
like every newspaper now is doing something

426
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:52,310
like the ethicist or ask carolyn hax

427
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:53,660
or whatever because they're always coming up

428
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:55,460
on my twitter feed but i read

429
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:59,030
one yesterday about um a guy who

430
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:01,010
went into his wife's phone

431
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:03,470
and looked at her messages don't do

432
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:06,380
that don't do it but every message

433
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:08,150
that she was sending to her friends

434
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:09,560
were about how much she hates him

435
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:13,040
ah so he's like well that's good

436
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,940
well i was chibi oh yeah that's

437
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,580
it's all like what to get to

438
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:17,930
the bottom of that what a loser

439
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:20,060
he is oh that's so sad yes

440
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:21,500
he was fired and now

441
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,810
i've had to to pick like i

442
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:25,340
it's been a financial drain on me

443
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:26,840
and he's like no we're i was

444
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,910
fired yes but the money we got

445
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:31,524
from selling our house she hasn't kid

446
00:15:31,524 --> 00:15:33,920
at her so he's like what do

447
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,450
i do because obviously i shouldn't have

448
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:38,450
gone into her phone but now i

449
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:40,760
know she hates me so i'm supposed

450
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:41,720
to sit here and take it

451
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:43,730
that's really rough i think you just

452
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:44,600
have to say you went in her

453
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:47,030
phone yeah that's what everyone's suspicious of

454
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:48,530
something i think they were saying they

455
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:50,420
were saying it's not equal yes i

456
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:51,560
did a bad thing but it's not

457
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:53,120
equal like her hating you shouldn't be

458
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,400
in a relationship so lead story yeah

459
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:57,470
you need to like settle that yeah

460
00:15:57,565 --> 00:15:59,360
yeah yeah but i but it always

461
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,710
gives the other person excuse to go

462
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:01,670
like well what are you going through

463
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:01,820
my

464
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:03,470
oh that's true that's so that's it

465
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:06,380
that's a tactic yeah yeah you're definitely

466
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:06,740
attacked

467
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:09,920
too good anywhere i use it all

468
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,630
the time and it's it's great because

469
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:12,980
you were right you know i use

470
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:14,240
it whether or not the phones involved

471
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:16,010
no because you can always say well

472
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:17,150
why were you going through my phone

473
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:19,310
and chances are they probably were yeah

474
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:20,870
ah it was to see if you

475
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:21,770
thought i was a loser

476
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,243
i felt like you hated me so

477
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:28,070
wanted to make sure um that's obvious

478
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,630
and i feel like obviously he's going

479
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:31,670
through her phone because he knows something

480
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:33,860
is wrong yeah yeah yeah you don't

481
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:35,990
you don't just do that yeah like

482
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:37,130
oh i think i might want to

483
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:39,350
go through someone's phone yeah that is

484
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:41,060
so chilling to me like if i

485
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:42,890

710
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:31,670
how the soup is made i especially

711
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:33,230
through the eyes of my character blurs

712
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:38,000
flavor i got your doggo yeah um

713
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:39,620
when's the last time you stayed up

714
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:42,800
for twenty four hours oh and i

715
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,240
think i think when we were doing

716
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,370
the the all night shows

717
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:49,370
and you cv the the twenty four

718
00:24:49,370 --> 00:24:52,130
hours i don't even know i know

719
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:53,690
that when i was younger i'd have

720
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:55,220
to peel that's true i guess when

721
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:56,342
i was like in college but it

722
00:24:56,342 --> 00:24:58,700
seems unfathomable to me now yeah and

723
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:01,040
it's so unnecessary i remember one night

724
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,350
like ah in my i was probably

725
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:06,080
in my forties or something and i

726
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:06,650
had an ur

727
00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:08,540
early flight but a late night the

728
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:11,000
night before and i was like i'll

729
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,650
just stay up stay up and go

730
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:13,700
to that always seems like a good

731
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:15,710
idea do it oh my god i

732
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:17,508
stayed up for two more hours and

733
00:25:17,508 --> 00:25:19,130
then it was like i can do

734
00:25:19,130 --> 00:25:21,110
it hey ho sleep i know i

735
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:22,880

1150
00:39:03,785 --> 00:39:07,625
this site and it had like that

1151
00:39:07,745 --> 00:39:08,765

an email back

1156
00:39:16,505 --> 00:39:19,115
that said you know your orders confirmed

1157
00:39:19,115 --> 00:39:21,695
and everything and then so much time

1158
00:39:21,695 --> 00:39:22,385
went by

1159
00:39:23,975 --> 00:39:25,355

1180
00:40:06,395 --> 00:40:08,195
there was like this instagram ad i

1181
00:40:08,225 --> 00:40:10,115

it was a carnival toy yeah i

1186
00:40:17,885 --> 00:40:20,555
couldn't stop laughing the one i've started

1187
00:40:20,555 --> 00:40:22,565
to notice and we'd notice it because

1188
00:40:22,715 --> 00:40:23,975
paul and i just did some shows

1189
00:40:23,975 --> 00:40:26,045
in new york which sold out thankfully

1190
00:40:26,045 --> 00:40:29,645
but people on twitter are now saying

1191
00:40:29,645 --> 00:40:32,015
like hey does anyone have want to

1192
00:40:32,015 --> 00:40:33,275
sell their ticket to the show

1193
00:40:34,565 --> 00:40:37,985
and then like several oh god scam

1194
00:40:37,985 --> 00:40:40,295
because these other people search for that

1195
00:40:40,955 --> 00:40:42,485
and then they say i have tickets

1196
00:40:42,485 --> 00:40:44,405
dm me and then they pay them

1197
00:40:44,435 --> 00:40:46,325
eighty bucks or when i noticed this

1198
00:40:46,325 --> 00:40:48,515
on facebook because i was providing none

1199
00:40:48,515 --> 00:40:49,685
of them follow me and i always

1200
00:40:49,805 --> 00:40:51,455
and so i've taken to try to

1201
00:40:51,455 --> 00:40:53,225
write back to everyone going these people

1202
00:40:53,225 --> 00:40:53,975
are scammers

1203
00:40:54,035 --> 00:40:55,415
because so many people have fallen for

1204
00:40:55,415 --> 00:40:57,515
it and contacted me saying yeah scammed

1205
00:40:57,515 --> 00:40:58,895
out of eighty dollars trying to come

1206
00:40:58,895 --> 00:41:00,095
to your show it's definitely if you're

1207
00:41:00,095 --> 00:41:01,475
doing something like that make sure you're

1208
00:41:01,475 --> 00:41:03,305
in like a group or something you're

1209
00:41:03,305 --> 00:41:04,835
not just throwing it out to the

1210
00:41:04,835 --> 00:41:07,355
world nobody was like this my facebook

1211
00:41:07,385 --> 00:41:09,665
might like public facebook page i posted

1212
00:41:09,665 --> 00:41:11,345
about my show and then i noticed

1213
00:41:11,345 --> 00:41:12,785
somebody was like hey i have three

1214
00:41:12,785 --> 00:41:13,985
tickets but i can't go it isn't

1215
00:41:13,985 --> 00:41:14,135
me

1216
00:41:14,195 --> 00:41:15,005
want them and i was like okay

1217
00:41:15,005 --> 00:41:16,715
that's normal that happens and then it

1218
00:41:16,715 --> 00:41:18,995
was like happening like spam like spam

1219
00:41:18,995 --> 00:41:21,305
amount of people saying like i bought

1220
00:41:21,305 --> 00:41:22,410
these tickets and unfortunately when i go

1221
00:41:22,410 --> 00:41:23,885
i bought these tickets and unfortunately i

1222
00:41:23,885 --> 00:41:25,145
was like oh this is fate and

1223
00:41:25,189 --> 00:41:27,005
the checks needed all of them but

1224
00:41:27,005 --> 00:41:29,105
it was such a believable way because

1225
00:41:29,105 --> 00:41:30,755
that is how people do sell tickets

1226
00:41:30,755 --> 00:41:32,015
and another one that i can't figure

1227
00:41:32,015 --> 00:41:34,205
out is the i'm paying five thousand

1228
00:41:34,205 --> 00:41:34,355

people are going like give me i

1234
00:41:42,695 --> 00:41:43,835

1309
00:44:41,465 --> 00:44:43,415
she's not something that that around when

i relate people have told you this

1311
00:44:44,795 --> 00:44:46,805

1312
00:44:46,805 --> 00:44:49,235
just roll like they'll do half hour

1313
00:44:49,235 --> 00:44:51,125
drinks with one and then schedule and

1314
00:44:51,125 --> 00:44:51,785
sometimes they go

1315
00:44:52,117 --> 00:44:54,155
actually totally i totally get why that's

1316
00:44:54,155 --> 00:44:56,735
a good idea because it's from what

1317
00:44:56,735 --> 00:44:57,845
i hear from my friends like online

1318
00:44:57,845 --> 00:44:59,105
dating so horrible and then you're like

1319
00:44:59,525 --> 00:45:01,265
you waste your night good yeah make

1320
00:45:01,265 --> 00:45:03,065
getting made up so yeah yeah and

1321
00:45:03,065 --> 00:45:04,475
you're like out with one person and

1322
00:45:04,475 --> 00:45:05,795
go home like that sucked so i

1323
00:45:05,825 --> 00:45:07,985
understand going out with a bunch but

1324
00:45:08,105 --> 00:45:10,475
that's not cool because then you're kind

1325
00:45:10,475 --> 00:45:12,275
of just you're not focusing

1326
00:45:12,605 --> 00:45:14,075
and you you don't really care about

1327
00:45:14,075 --> 00:45:15,305
ain't right i mean it's like you're

1328
00:45:15,305 --> 00:45:16,955
not yes that doesn't feel i don't

1329
00:45:16,955 --> 00:45:18,425
know why anyone would ask me about

1330
00:45:18,485 --> 00:45:20,405
dating advice so i'm not even going

1331
00:45:21,365 --> 00:45:24,365
i also say um if somebody is

1332
00:45:24,365 --> 00:45:27,335
talking a lot and not listening a

1333
00:45:27,335 --> 00:45:29,435
ton yeah people you know it here's

1334
00:45:29,435 --> 00:45:31,235
what it is somebody who doesn't ask

1335
00:45:31,235 --> 00:45:32,315
quest's yeah

1336
00:45:32,651 --> 00:45:33,785
it's just hard because you're trying to

1337
00:45:33,785 --> 00:45:37,251
seem cool so some sometimes you the

1338
00:45:37,251 --> 00:45:38,945
the impulses to talk too much about

1339
00:45:38,945 --> 00:45:40,055
yourself because you want to go like

1340
00:45:40,055 --> 00:45:41,435
see i'm i'm a good person to

1341
00:45:41,435 --> 00:45:44,195
date because but but yeah really i

1342
00:45:44,525 --> 00:45:46,055
asking people wanna just ask about the

1343
00:45:46,055 --> 00:45:46,955
people i want to be asked about

1344
00:45:46,955 --> 00:45:48,365
themselves so i wouldn't even talk about

1345
00:45:48,365 --> 00:45:49,595
myself at all i would just like

1346
00:45:49,595 --> 00:45:52,145
go but then you seem evasive yeah

1347
00:45:52,625 --> 00:45:54,485
well yeah but i'm drug dealer i

1348
00:45:54,485 --> 00:45:55,895
do i do about ah don't worry

1349
00:45:55,895 --> 00:45:57,545
about that yeah yeah really

1350
00:45:58,598 --> 00:46:00,065
let's not talk about me let's talk

1351
00:46:00,065 --> 00:46:01,595
about use as a shield over the

1352
00:46:01,595 --> 00:46:04,445
question ideally it's it's a given taken

1353
00:46:04,445 --> 00:46:06,095
if you're not feeling a given take

1354
00:46:06,125 --> 00:46:08,165
then it's probably not a good idea

1355
00:46:08,255 --> 00:46:09,695
and i think it's a red flag

1356
00:46:09,695 --> 00:46:11,165
if you can't tell if they like

1357
00:46:11,165 --> 00:46:12,485
you if you're going out with somebody

1358
00:46:12,515 --> 00:46:14,045
yeah i don't know yeah yeah i'll

1359
00:46:14,045 --> 00:46:15,695
do that a lot also someone doesn't

1360
00:46:16,055 --> 00:46:17,345

00:49:43,565 --> 00:49:45,365
crazy real time with bill maher i

1461
00:49:45,365 --> 00:49:46,985
would not have met my wow wisely

1462
00:49:47,135 --> 00:49:48,905
i realising there was even more risk

1463
00:49:48,935 --> 00:49:51,065
with my story that i i basically

1464
00:49:51,215 --> 00:49:52,985
got two pilots we didn't know what

1465
00:49:52,985 --> 00:49:53,885
would happen with either one of them

1466
00:49:54,095 --> 00:49:55,235
but only one of them i'd only

1467
00:49:55,235 --> 00:49:57,005
been like seven episodes out of ten

1468
00:49:57,005 --> 00:49:58,295
and one i'd been all tense okay

1469
00:49:58,295 --> 00:49:59,255
i'll pick that one we didn't know

1470
00:49:59,255 --> 00:50:00,995
what would get picked um then it

1471
00:50:01,025 --> 00:50:03,575
did then it was a full year

1472
00:50:03,575 --> 00:50:05,105
of waiting for it to be shot

1473
00:50:05,165 --> 00:50:06,425
the next episode to be shot and

1474
00:50:06,425 --> 00:50:07,715
then i got to know mike during

1475
00:50:07,715 --> 00:50:08,765
the time as a friend which is

1476
00:50:08,765 --> 00:50:10,895
also so that was all just so

1477
00:50:10,895 --> 00:50:12,425
random but normally that would be very

1478
00:50:12,425 --> 00:50:14,495
disappointing situation and i've been you know

1479
00:50:14,495 --> 00:50:15,575
think anything of it at the time

1480
00:50:15,575 --> 00:50:17,555
but i never do do we have

1481
00:50:17,675 --> 00:50:18,875
i think if i hadn't got into

1482
00:50:18,875 --> 00:50:20,645
comedy i'd be a movie star okay

1483
00:50:22,625 --> 00:50:25,745

hi lauren column stop this is becca

1595
00:54:27,110 --> 00:54:29,150
from milwaukee when i was about six

1596
00:54:29,150 --> 00:54:30,980
or seven my teenage cousin told me

1597
00:54:30,980 --> 00:54:33,380
that people with flat feet cannot serve

1598
00:54:33,380 --> 00:54:35,450
in the military because they're very ticklish

1599
00:54:35,750 --> 00:54:36,830
and if they were tops of the

1600
00:54:36,858 --> 00:54:38,750
enemy soldiers to just tickle them until

1601
00:54:38,750 --> 00:54:41,810
they revealed us military secrets i believe

1602
00:54:41,810 --> 00:54:43,550
this was a very long time i

1603
00:54:43,550 --> 00:54:44,360
think it was a middle school

1604
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:45,830
cool before i finally realised it was

1605
00:54:45,830 --> 00:54:47,390
alive it's not that low my question

1606
00:54:47,390 --> 00:54:49,010
for you is what is something silly

1607
00:54:49,010 --> 00:54:50,150
that you believe when you were a

1608
00:54:50,210 --> 00:54:52,550
kid or something that you need briefly

1609
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:54,020
fell for as an adult that you

1610
00:54:54,020 --> 00:54:56,422
really should have known better and love

1611
00:54:56,422 --> 00:54:57,860
the show by oh my god i

1612
00:54:57,860 --> 00:54:59,600

1613
00:54:59,630 --> 00:55:01,040
yet can't think of one you know

1614
00:55:01,100 --> 00:55:04,520
i remember for me a humiliating moment

1615
00:55:04,529 --> 00:55:05,690
was getting in an argument with a

1616
00:55:05,690 --> 00:55:07,190
classmate when i was in eighth grade

1617
00:55:07,790 --> 00:55:10,550
that ah england and great britain were

1618
00:55:10,580 --> 00:55:13,490
two separate places great and then had

1619
00:55:13,490 --> 00:55:16,190
to go in front of the class

1620
00:55:16,550 --> 00:55:18,740
like we were arguing and and um

1621
00:55:18,770 --> 00:55:20,000
the teacher called us up and said

1622
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,310
what are you guys talking about and

1623
00:55:22,310 --> 00:55:24,650
i was like she thinks great britain

1624
00:55:24,680 --> 00:55:26,540
england are the same country

1625
00:55:27,740 --> 00:55:30,500
and ah then i had to i

1626
00:55:30,590 --> 00:55:32,240
like i was made a spectacle of

1627
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:34,670
in front of the frame perfect yeah

1628
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:37,280
i can't think of one enough taught

1629
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:39,020
my head but i've definitely made many

1630
00:55:39,020 --> 00:55:41,000
many mistakes in my life yeah that's

1631
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:43,100

when they were growing up that there

1639
00:55:54,110 --> 00:55:54,740
