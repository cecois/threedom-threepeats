00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:13,680
older gentlemen who like hung out of

the bar and i think forty yeah

137
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:16,650
probably

138
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:21,420
ah so these senior citizens would come

139
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:23,400
in that's how i felt when i

140
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,410
started improv because i was like sure

141
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:27,060
never one was like twenty eight and

142
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,520
you're like jesus what are they doing

143
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,350
with their lives records that old kill

144
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:33,720
me yeah but so so they would

145
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,130
always go like come on do it

146
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:37,230
do it and so she would give

147
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:37,920
a cd

148
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:40,328
two i guess the band or no

149
00:05:40,328 --> 00:05:41,909
it knows you put it on the

150
00:05:41,909 --> 00:05:44,340
the house speakers and it was a

151
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:46,320
karaoke track oh no it was just

152
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,700
the joe cocker song you can leave

153
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:50,970
your hat on and she she would

154
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:53,400
do the nine and a half weeks

155
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:56,850
kind of strip dance with with a

156
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:58,080
fedora would she

157
00:05:58,109 --> 00:05:59,970
remove clothing or no i think she

158
00:05:59,972 --> 00:06:01,470

159
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:03,750
like unbutton the shirt and go down

160
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:05,490
it was just like it was very

161
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:07,470
weird in a work environment that we

162
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:08,730
have to loop so this is where

163
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:10,470

reserved but when you really listen to

00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:11,890
this is ten years or so ago

579
00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:13,570

00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:14,080
you trees

581
00:20:15,875 --> 00:20:16,175
yeah

582
00:20:18,455 --> 00:20:19,895
but out there that's right they have

583
00:20:19,895 --> 00:20:22,985
library wow books they judge the worst

584
00:20:22,985 --> 00:20:24,875
thing he's ever done the books they

585
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:25,955
check out from the library all the

586
00:20:25,955 --> 00:20:27,065
time so like i was trapped there

587
00:20:27,065 --> 00:20:28,145
so i just started reading one of

588
00:20:28,145 --> 00:20:29,465
their books and it was a mystery

589
00:20:29,465 --> 00:20:31,385
novel and it was like obviously not

590
00:20:31,385 --> 00:20:32,615
written very well but it was like

591
00:20:32,645 --> 00:20:34,085
oh let me check out and it

592
00:20:34,085 --> 00:20:36,275
was a popular series i read go

593
00:20:36,275 --> 00:20:36,965
these are popular

594
00:20:37,655 --> 00:20:39,095
i read it and i was just

595
00:20:39,095 --> 00:20:40,235
like i had nothing else to do

596
00:20:40,715 --> 00:20:43,895
and there was one black character and

597
00:20:43,895 --> 00:20:45,815
i could not believe this is like

598
00:20:45,815 --> 00:20:48,965
a modern book because everything that the

599
00:20:48,965 --> 00:20:51,905
black character said they took out like

600
00:20:51,905 --> 00:20:53,135
the i n g s they just

601
00:20:53,135 --> 00:20:56,015
had i an apostrophe and that was

602
00:20:56,015 --> 00:20:57,395
bad enough and the n

603
00:20:57,395 --> 00:20:59,015
and she was always saying things like

604
00:20:59,015 --> 00:21:01,175
show enough instead of sure enough and

605
00:21:01,175 --> 00:21:03,185
stuff like oh and i was just

606
00:21:03,185 --> 00:21:04,955
like i can't believe this is a

607
00:21:04,955 --> 00:21:07,205
popular book current book and this is

608
00:21:07,205 --> 00:21:08,585
a book series and then at one

609
00:21:08,585 --> 00:21:10,775
point towards the end the murderer came

610
00:21:10,775 --> 00:21:13,775
out and the black character said feats

611
00:21:13,775 --> 00:21:15,725
don't fail me now no it was

612
00:21:15,815 --> 00:21:17,525
crazy says insane

613
00:21:17,585 --> 00:21:19,295

insight into like middle america of just

742
00:26:08,315 --> 00:26:10,805
no dear it's music these headphones would

743
00:26:10,805 --> 00:26:12,335
fit in that box he's an idiot

744
00:26:12,335 --> 00:26:15,125
don't you know hey yeah i have

745
00:26:15,275 --> 00:26:17,615
to be honest i've not looked above

746
00:26:17,615 --> 00:26:20,195
your chin oh my i'm really sorry

747
00:26:20,195 --> 00:26:22,295
actually it's that same funky if you're

748
00:26:22,295 --> 00:26:23,495
staring at his chin this is great

749
00:26:23,495 --> 00:26:24,635
because you could pick out a lineup

750
00:26:24,635 --> 00:26:25,475
this is a great tip if you

751
00:26:25,475 --> 00:26:27,215
were being attacked okay just

752
00:26:27,654 --> 00:26:29,525
and stare at their chin you will

753
00:26:29,525 --> 00:26:31,445
not the face throughout the whole attack

754
00:26:31,595 --> 00:26:33,395
as much as you can really process

755
00:26:33,395 --> 00:26:37,595
what really relaxing enjoy yourself because that's

756
00:26:38,045 --> 00:26:39,965
supposedly an easier way to pick some

757
00:26:39,965 --> 00:26:41,105
out of a lineup because when people

758
00:26:41,105 --> 00:26:43,565
all look similar that they've a chance

759
00:26:43,577 --> 00:26:46,055
is the distinguishing yeah feature also if

760
00:26:46,055 --> 00:26:47,135
you have to do like really fast

761
00:26:47,285 --> 00:26:47,555
pirouette

762
00:26:47,555 --> 00:26:49,355
bets you won't get dizzy yeah focus

763
00:26:49,355 --> 00:26:51,065
on the chance yeah yeah

764
00:26:53,285 --> 00:26:54,485
because it would take ballet scott i

765
00:26:54,485 --> 00:26:57,335
did wow what what are you doing

766
00:26:57,665 --> 00:26:58,565

767
00:26:58,595 --> 00:27:00,815
why did you do that i went

this yeah it's great and it's like

850
00:29:55,689 --> 00:29:57,635
but i don't think of it as

851
00:29:57,635 --> 00:29:59,825
a relaxation that it's just come to

852
00:29:59,825 --> 00:30:01,565
mind like you're probably glad to wine

853
00:30:01,565 --> 00:30:03,395
style yeah it's usually on the weekend

854
00:30:03,395 --> 00:30:05,135

857
00:30:09,365 --> 00:30:11,375
week yeah i love that but i

858
00:30:11,375 --> 00:30:14,233
do i do forget that oh yeah

859
00:30:14,233 --> 00:30:15,665
i could it's legal i could just

860
00:30:15,665 --> 00:30:17,315
do that then it would be you

861
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:18,305

864
00:30:22,355 --> 00:30:23,555
a doctor's appointment

865
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:26,950
awesome yeah it was great um i

866
00:30:26,953 --> 00:30:29,680
got a physical you know okay um

867
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:31,090
which actually i haven't done in a

868
00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:32,470
very long time i feel like like

869
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:34,540
i assume to fisa as a woman

870
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:35,620
i feel like you go to the

871
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:37,300
doctor a lot but it's not a

872
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:39,820
physical it's like you're obi yes psychologist

873
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:41,710
yes yes and that kind of feels

874
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:43,390
like you should do one was the

875
00:30:43,390 --> 00:30:44,320
basis but i

876
00:30:44,577 --> 00:30:45,610
i don't yeah so i'm like no

877
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:46,960
i'm i'm like planning to do that

878
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:50,590
and um they asked me if i

879
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:52,630
um were using them to fill out

880
00:30:52,630 --> 00:30:54,130
the form with what you you drink

881
00:30:54,130 --> 00:30:56,470
and if you do drugs smoke cigarettes

882
00:30:57,010 --> 00:30:58,180
and then it's like i put down

883
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:02,410
marijuana which is funny caring male yeah

884
00:31:02,410 --> 00:31:04,030
and then they're like okay and then

885
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:04,510
she was she

886
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:05,680
it's like this young though it was

887
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:06,520
like a nurse talking to me but

888
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:08,620
she's like asking me about my weed

889
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:09,910
usage and it's like it's just very

890
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:11,770
funny because it's the same as drinking

891
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:13,960
this is not like revelatory it's just

892
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,340
like feels like you're man this feels

893
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:16,900
like you're writing something elite like i'm

894
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:18,970
like yeah say yeah luckily we yeah

895
00:31:18,988 --> 00:31:21,970
sorry judgment and just try yanis drugs

896
00:31:21,970 --> 00:31:24,676
yeah well the weird thing they they

897
00:31:24,730 --> 00:31:26,800
will really judge you for smoking yeah

898
00:31:26,806 --> 00:31:28,870
yeah like it i found that doctors

899
00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:30,400
don't really care about the drinking they

900
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,540
don't as long as you just go

901
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:33,190
for the drinking like you know like

902
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:35,140
twice a week yeah just lie and

903
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:35,590
just say please

904
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,010
but they they really judge you for

905
00:31:39,010 --> 00:31:40,600
the dread a wedding maybe i'll have

906
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,790
a drink and a cigarette but yes

907
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:45,730
cigarettes they'll be like yeah yeah stop

908
00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:48,700
stop right away doctor once when i

909
00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:50,590
said how much coffee i drank i

910
00:31:50,590 --> 00:31:52,990
said i drink three cups of coffee

911
00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:54,340
in the morning and went oh whoa

912
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:55,960
hey yeah you maybe want to cut

913
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,130
back on that so that's

914
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,630
i mean although i guess if he's

915
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:01,720
temperamental like the doctor well it seems

916
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,070
like a little bit more he seemed

917
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:05,020
she seemed like alarmed and i was

918
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:06,760
like is that but i didn't think

919
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,890
that coffee was yeah bad well what

920
00:32:08,890 --> 00:32:11,260
is it i drink now i drink

921
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:12,940
two cups i guess it's the caffeine

922
00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:14,440
yeah i don't know yeah probably

923
00:32:16,090 --> 00:32:18,700
do you think shapes five one cup

924
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:19,960
of coffee of the morning that's it

925
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:22,120
and and i used to when we

926
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:25,180
lived by coffee bean we would always

927
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:27,820
walk rockies me yeah and teeling i'm

928
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:31,030
so sorry daily yod we would walk

929
00:32:31,030 --> 00:32:32,740
the it was an excuse every day

930
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:34,300
to walk the dog his dog tricks

931
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:35,710
of course walk the dog yeah

932
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,390
my you walk the dog in front

933
00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:38,260
of soppy

934
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:40,630
i make you sleep i would do

935
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:41,620
it for all the customers

936
00:32:42,730 --> 00:32:44,500
no tips needed i don't know what

937
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:47,590
ah but it was always an excuse

938
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:50,320
to get like a big demon like

939
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:52,690
coffee drink and yeah and that seems

940
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,044
kind of fun if you ever buy

941
00:32:54,044 --> 00:32:55,660
a nice coffee shop yeah it was

942
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:57,250
a five minute walk or whatever joy

943
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:59,590
because sometimes that's why people buy places

944
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:00,640
is they're like oh it's just a

945
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:01,960
five minute walk to a coffee place

946
00:33:01,965 --> 00:33:02,650
whatever but

947
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:04,660
first of all my financial person was

948
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:06,820
like you know i see you spending

949
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:08,140
a lot of money a coffee bean

950
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:10,810
and tea leaf basically change avocado toast

951
00:33:10,870 --> 00:33:12,970
millennial sort of it's kind of a

952
00:33:12,970 --> 00:33:14,080
weird one to pick on because you

953
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:16,420
just feel like yeah well i'm sure

954
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:17,440
you were spending more money in other

955
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,450
areas sure but any your accountant can

956
00:33:19,450 --> 00:33:21,460
i please have one goddamn pleasure in

957
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:23,020
my life and i get a fucking

958
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:25,840
coffee in the morning however much we

959
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:26,950
know so when you really think about

960
00:33:26,950 --> 00:33:29,230
it it's like between cool urbanites like

961
00:33:29,230 --> 00:33:31,000
twelve dollars a day or whatever right

962
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,290
yeah so she's like maybe you could

963
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:33,430
drink coffee at home and then the

964
00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:35,080
other part of it is like you're

965
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:37,690
putting six hundred calories or whatever well

966
00:33:37,690 --> 00:33:39,417
that's more like one of those hey

967
00:33:39,417 --> 00:33:40,750
yeah and i talked to another friend

968
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:42,310
who was like yeah always gaining a

969
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:43,210
lot of weight and

970
00:33:43,210 --> 00:33:44,590
and then my friend said well you

971
00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:46,030
get one of these every single day

972
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:49,000
yeah it's so so we then just

973
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,920
got a coffee maker and now have

974
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:52,450

976
00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:55,870
like i drink my coffee black which

977
00:33:55,870 --> 00:33:57,550

1056
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:22,930

1061
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:32,350
to fill it g

1062
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:34,600
so it's with you for like a

1063
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:35,080
month

1064
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:41,440
ah with the keep going almost yeah

1065
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:44,920
but but the results came back that

1066
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:47,530
there was like foreign matter in there

1067
00:36:48,370 --> 00:36:51,580
which shot which means pennies you know

1068
00:36:51,769 --> 00:36:55,180
cancer essentially oh no my so yeah

1069
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:56,170
you ate a thought

1070
00:36:56,170 --> 00:36:57,812
on paper killen yeah i say

1071
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:02,380
screw so i was like i gotta

1072
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:03,670
know the people eat an average of

1073
00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:04,840
four screws a year just when they

1074
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:07,360
crawl in your mouth no way really

1075
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:10,600
when you become a foreign matter well

1076
00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:11,680
think that's the thing they don't know

1077
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:13,210
what it is but they they say

1078
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:15,370
we've we found foreign foreign matter in

1079
00:37:15,370 --> 00:37:17,470
there so like i looked it up

1080
00:37:17,530 --> 00:37:19,360
yeah i was like holy shit do

1081
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,504
i have cancer i looked it up

1082
00:37:20,504 --> 00:37:23,590
and i was like they say just

1083
00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:27,070
basically these the it's very easy to

1084
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:27,610
get a false

1085
00:37:27,610 --> 00:37:30,040
it's positive essentially so needs to call

1086
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,900
an oscar so so my doctor called

1087
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:33,460
in and i was and he goes

1088
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:35,320
hey so your results came back he

1089
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:37,570
goes i would not worry at all

1090
00:37:37,570 --> 00:37:39,940
because there's so many false positives you

1091
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:42,100
need to get a colonoscopy obviously but

1092
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:44,620
because when this positive comes back you

1093
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:46,450
have to get one but just don't

1094
00:37:46,450 --> 00:37:47,718
even like stress about it

1095
00:37:47,770 --> 00:37:48,850
all like don't put it out of

1096
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:49,960
your because that could lead to cancer

1097
00:37:50,050 --> 00:37:51,909
yeah so i went and got the

1098
00:37:51,909 --> 00:37:53,680
colonoscopy and you know they give you

1099
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:54,820
all the drinks and all and you're

1100
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:56,920
supposed to fast and i question yeah

1101
00:37:57,220 --> 00:37:58,420
you could've skipped the shit in the

1102
00:37:58,420 --> 00:38:00,580
box step because you technically your age

1103
00:38:00,610 --> 00:38:02,140
have to get anyway right no no

1104
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:03,220
