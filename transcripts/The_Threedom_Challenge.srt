on netflix yes sounds like you're so

61
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:28,020
late

62
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,360
you're so lame this is not a

63
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,580
documentary it's docu drama

64
00:02:33,739 --> 00:02:35,430
i suppose the central park five yeah

65
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:37,800
right and i've i've watched one and

66
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,750
a half episodes yeah whatever parts but

67
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:41,130
we always so watched it all in

68
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:43,020
one day it's like brutal i start

69
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:44,400
watching a show buying dash what they

70
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,320
did to the person oh my god

71
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:50,880
no just the first part it's so

72
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:52,260
so i mean of course i know

73
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:55,260
the story but not that well but

74
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:57,090
watching it and then seeing like the

75
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:58,950
way in which these people clued into

76
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:00,870
this but then the detectives also know

77
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:02,520
they didn't do it within their core

78
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:04,650
coercing them and also straight up just

79
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:06,990
like lying to make it seem like

80
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:07,680
it's true yeah

81
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,900
it is so horrible i can't even

82
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,880
imagine that's like everyone's worst nightmare to

83
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,650
be falsely accused of a crime did

84
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:16,500
you use to have a lot of

85
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:19,020
worries about going to prison eventually i

86
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:20,430
used to like being in the army

87
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:21,570
and going to prison those were my

88
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:23,700
two biggest because i think that the

89
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:25,620
movies first of all in the eighties

90
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:26,820
there were a ton of movies where

91
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,840
people went to boot camp

92
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:29,160
but didn't want to be there yeah

93
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:30,540
so i was always thinking about that

94
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:31,890
like being in boot camp and having

95
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:33,750
a drill sergeant yelling emi but also

96
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:34,830
there's a ton of movies where like

97
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:36,540
people go to prison for whatever reason

98
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:38,580
yeah and so i just grew up

99
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:40,470
think i think i'm at a point

100
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,700
where i don't think i'm going to

101
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,530
prison in my life yeah but it

102
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:45,030
could be an accident it could yeah

103
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:46,590
that's the thing it could be some

104
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:48,000
weird accident where i'm just like wow

105
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,680
l going to prison for three years

106
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,290
goodbye i saw scary watching oz when

00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:53,880
it was first on hbo and i

108
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,290

00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:57,330
seasons of it before i realized it

did we talk about all the sun

114
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:07,260
raised by tv but what is the

115
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,160
permit is someone who goes

116
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:11,130
joel who's falsely accused him falsely no

117
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:13,500
no ones falsely accused this example show

118
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:15,090
about a bunch of people in prison

119
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:17,850
oh but but may sound familiar it

120
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:19,260
kinda goes through the eyes it a

121
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:23,640
little tang it literally is google itself

122
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,830
sir the p o v character though

123
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:27,450
is like the dude from wayne's world

124
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:27,900
who

125
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,300
um yeah when

126
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:35,220
who goes to prison looks like ernest

127
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,110

128
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,760
in there for a drunk driving facts

129
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:40,560

131
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,990
j k simmons j k simmons like

133
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:51,600

00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,090
neonazi yeah he's terrifying and that's the

135
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:55,620
first time i ever saw him do

136
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:56,910
that eminem is scary

137
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:00,330
you should give that role up that's

138
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:01,679
my opinion was that they use little

139
00:05:01,679 --> 00:05:03,300
marshall mathers you get em and i

140
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:05,040
wasn't john goodman the first yellow eminent

141
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,300

00:26:07,145 --> 00:26:08,555
house trying to remember like i'm getting

740
00:26:08,555 --> 00:26:10,715
people and i was like love it

741
00:26:10,775 --> 00:26:12,275
i guess this is thirty

742
00:26:12,305 --> 00:26:13,817
years ago i can't remember this yeah

743
00:26:13,869 --> 00:26:15,365
i think it's good that to me

744
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:16,835
has always been great because i think

745
00:26:16,835 --> 00:26:18,425
like my whole life i i feel

746
00:26:18,427 --> 00:26:19,685
like i was very aware i can

747
00:26:19,685 --> 00:26:21,575
remember ever whenever yet i'd go we

748
00:26:21,575 --> 00:26:22,595
met one time and it was right

749
00:26:22,595 --> 00:26:24,755
here when then i'd be like you

750
00:26:24,755 --> 00:26:26,735
know always if someone forgot me i

751
00:26:26,735 --> 00:26:29,405
remember i now have no idea who

752
00:26:29,405 --> 00:26:31,655
those people are that's my i'm and

753
00:26:31,655 --> 00:26:32,435
i'm happy for it

754
00:26:32,765 --> 00:26:34,565
i did a documentary on my parents

755
00:26:34,565 --> 00:26:36,785
and how they met a few years

756
00:26:36,785 --> 00:26:39,515
back oh yeah and i remember asking

757
00:26:39,695 --> 00:26:42,425
my father about like other women he

758
00:26:42,455 --> 00:26:44,405
dated and he couldn't remember their names

759
00:26:44,405 --> 00:26:45,605
and i was i remember going like

760
00:26:45,605 --> 00:26:47,585
this you can't remember their names boy

761
00:26:47,585 --> 00:26:49,175
sucks to get old i don't think

762
00:26:49,175 --> 00:26:51,005
i could remember the names of certain

763
00:26:51,005 --> 00:26:52,595
i'll learn the names of people that

764
00:26:52,625 --> 00:26:54,695
i dated and why there are there

765
00:26:54,695 --> 00:26:55,715
are people when i think about high

766
00:26:55,715 --> 00:26:57,095
school and i mean i think about

767
00:26:57,095 --> 00:26:58,205
like doing the shows in high school

768
00:26:58,625 --> 00:27:00,065
there are people that i can see

769
00:27:00,065 --> 00:27:01,265
and i in my mind i can

770
00:27:01,265 --> 00:27:03,935
remember like vivid exchanges with them and

771
00:27:03,935 --> 00:27:05,705
times that we had camera their names

772
00:27:05,735 --> 00:27:07,115
but then everyone somehow it'll pop in

773
00:27:07,115 --> 00:27:08,285
my head like as we were just

774
00:27:08,285 --> 00:27:09,575
talking about it i was like i'm

775
00:27:09,575 --> 00:27:11,975
not gonna remember people's names like brad

776
00:27:12,035 --> 00:27:12,545
eberly

777
00:27:12,905 --> 00:27:15,245
like i brought my he'd just popped

778
00:27:15,245 --> 00:27:16,145
in my head i was like oh

779
00:27:16,145 --> 00:27:17,585
yeah but it's like it's like i

780
00:27:17,585 --> 00:27:19,415
don't like when people are very presumptuous

781
00:27:19,415 --> 00:27:22,265
about you remembering them i find that

782
00:27:22,265 --> 00:27:24,995
really rude like yeah like we met

783
00:27:25,025 --> 00:27:26,915
like i hate i vote and seven

784
00:27:26,915 --> 00:27:28,145
that i guess when i go up

785
00:27:28,145 --> 00:27:29,555
to someone and go hey scott ackerman

786
00:27:29,555 --> 00:27:31,565
they go i know it's like well

787
00:27:31,595 --> 00:27:32,915
damn i'm trying to save you

788
00:27:33,005 --> 00:27:34,955
yeah i've always prefer someone to reintroduce

789
00:27:34,955 --> 00:27:36,485
themselves even if i know yeah but

790
00:27:36,485 --> 00:27:37,595
if i'm like pretty sure i know

791
00:27:37,595 --> 00:27:38,495
that guy's name isn't if he goes

792
00:27:38,645 --> 00:27:40,205

794
00:27:41,915 --> 00:27:44,255
wondering or better yet to go i'm

795
00:27:44,255 --> 00:27:45,335
saying so we met doing this and

796
00:27:45,335 --> 00:27:47,405
i'm like thank god i used to

797
00:27:47,405 --> 00:27:49,295
be insulted by that when i still

798
00:27:49,295 --> 00:27:52,535
remembered everyone's name and face right now

799
00:27:52,565 --> 00:27:53,075
yeah if so

800
00:27:53,075 --> 00:27:55,052
nobody doesn't remember me it's fucking fire

801
00:27:55,052 --> 00:27:56,529
yeah yeah i don't take it personally

802
00:27:56,529 --> 00:27:57,965
yeah paul f tompkins who could forget

803
00:27:57,965 --> 00:28:01,715
you you'd be surprised ah emmy academy

804
00:28:02,135 --> 00:28:07,025
ah poor paul for paul i ain't

805
00:28:07,025 --> 00:28:10,055
me if they had facial recognition software

806
00:28:10,055 --> 00:28:11,765
that you could install into your eyes

807
00:28:11,765 --> 00:28:12,125
would you

808
00:28:13,265 --> 00:28:15,215
no why

809
00:28:16,745 --> 00:28:17,792
i don't want to have something in

810
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:20,375
my eyeball you have contacts don't you

811
00:28:20,405 --> 00:28:21,905
what if it feels like we're installing

812
00:28:21,905 --> 00:28:23,165
it into my ah no i'm saying

813
00:28:23,165 --> 00:28:25,085
like if you had noodles good when

814
00:28:25,175 --> 00:28:26,735
it feels great yeah it feels like

815
00:28:26,735 --> 00:28:28,565
a massage all day i want it

816
00:28:28,655 --> 00:28:30,425
like like a neck and neckline was

817
00:28:30,425 --> 00:28:32,735
too that's kevin you know bats paul

818
00:28:33,065 --> 00:28:34,235
that is scott i'm like i know

819
00:28:34,235 --> 00:28:36,425
these people but if it was because

820
00:28:36,425 --> 00:28:36,515
he

821
00:28:36,515 --> 00:28:39,005
i was like black mirror now it's

822
00:28:39,245 --> 00:28:40,263
if it was like black mirror where

823
00:28:40,266 --> 00:28:42,395
you look at someone suddenly like ca

824
00:28:42,905 --> 00:28:45,844
and came under stats came up yeah

825
00:28:46,666 --> 00:28:48,605
it's like you met doing this yeah

826
00:28:48,695 --> 00:28:50,165
yeah that'd be kind of cool i

827
00:28:50,165 --> 00:28:52,475
guess but but but everyone wouldn't they

828
00:28:52,475 --> 00:28:55,055
always be like blinking weirdly every time

829
00:28:55,055 --> 00:28:56,435
you met anyone what if you made

830
00:28:56,435 --> 00:28:56,675
it so

831
00:28:56,675 --> 00:28:58,715
it's not like that oh yeah no

832
00:28:59,915 --> 00:29:00,785
know i feel like you need to

833
00:29:00,785 --> 00:29:02,885
blink to dismiss staying on that likelier

834
00:29:02,885 --> 00:29:04,747
episode where they are like having memories

835
00:29:04,747 --> 00:29:06,185
in the guy i love that sort

836
00:29:06,185 --> 00:29:08,165
of a playback on tv yeah so

837
00:29:08,165 --> 00:29:10,175
tom collins in it oh really i

838
00:29:10,175 --> 00:29:11,735
believe so i don't oh i don't

839
00:29:11,735 --> 00:29:12,815
know that i know what he looks

840
00:29:12,845 --> 00:29:15,765
like i mean mature nice guy tatiana

841
00:29:15,965 --> 00:29:19,955
sky wife nice guy um i don't

842
00:29:19,985 --> 00:29:21,875
no but i feel like everyone always

843
00:29:21,875 --> 00:29:23,435
glosses over how much people will just

844
00:29:23,435 --> 00:29:25,775
be like twitching like you know some

845
00:29:25,835 --> 00:29:27,995
other meat with rice for sure you

846
00:29:27,995 --> 00:29:30,275
know like a it all works perfectly

847
00:29:30,305 --> 00:29:32,255
other than the one person who has

848
00:29:32,255 --> 00:29:34,145
the monkeys paw or whatever oh in

849
00:29:34,145 --> 00:29:36,095
the episode it's like their eyes like

850
00:29:36,095 --> 00:29:37,955
glaze over right like a like a

851
00:29:38,075 --> 00:29:39,335
it's like a film comes over their

852
00:29:39,335 --> 00:29:40,115
eyes when they're well

853
00:29:40,145 --> 00:29:41,525
okay well that's what happens in the

854
00:29:41,525 --> 00:29:44,525
mcallister episode yeah because i were you

855
00:29:44,525 --> 00:29:46,265
thinking of my guess they reuse that

856
00:29:46,265 --> 00:29:48,965
technology what technology do you wish that

857
00:29:48,965 --> 00:29:51,875
they would invent that has not been

858
00:29:51,875 --> 00:29:55,072
invented teleportation yeah yes that's my main

859
00:29:55,085 --> 00:29:57,395
when would you trust it though i

860
00:29:57,423 --> 00:29:58,955
do it in a second like well

861
00:29:58,955 --> 00:30:00,245
this is the question i

862
00:30:00,305 --> 00:30:02,525
had about self-driving cars with my parents

863
00:30:02,795 --> 00:30:04,265
where i was very surprised i said

864
00:30:04,265 --> 00:30:06,395
to them like i don't know like

865
00:30:06,395 --> 00:30:08,195
trusting the self-driving cars my mom mom's

866
00:30:08,209 --> 00:30:11,045
like it would be so our lives

867
00:30:11,045 --> 00:30:13,205
would be so much easier the fact

868
00:30:13,205 --> 00:30:14,735
that i if there's something wrong and

869
00:30:14,735 --> 00:30:15,995
i have to go to the hospital

870
00:30:16,025 --> 00:30:18,785
like i have to get your father

871
00:30:18,785 --> 00:30:19,985
to drive me he doesn't have a

872
00:30:19,985 --> 00:30:20,435
license

873
00:30:20,435 --> 00:30:21,815
you know all you know they're just

874
00:30:21,815 --> 00:30:23,075
like if i could just get into

875
00:30:23,075 --> 00:30:24,575
a car program it and it drives

876
00:30:24,575 --> 00:30:26,165
me there he would be in it

877
00:30:26,195 --> 00:30:27,365
i would love it so on there

878
00:30:27,365 --> 00:30:29,375
are probably fewer accidents for the most

879
00:30:29,375 --> 00:30:31,655
part because yeah because yeah my concern

880
00:30:31,655 --> 00:30:33,605
about it is it has we have

881
00:30:33,605 --> 00:30:34,955
to do it all at once well

882
00:30:34,955 --> 00:30:37,235
yeah everyone everyone has to coach into

883
00:30:37,235 --> 00:30:39,275
the tv thing that no on just

884
00:30:39,305 --> 00:30:40,595
hold on a second scott

885
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:43,740
yeah this is what you do this

886
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:46,470
one room or you wonder oh you

887
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:48,390
wonder oh he wonders about oh he

888
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:50,550
wonders about things now i wonder what

889
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:51,750
kind of candy bars but doesn't know

890
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:52,410
because i remember

891
00:30:53,850 --> 00:30:54,900
i feel like it has to go

892
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:57,638
to all self-driving cars yes you probably

893
00:30:57,660 --> 00:30:59,880
bored with teleportation i feel the same

894
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:02,370
way about lasik words like i'll let

895
00:31:02,370 --> 00:31:04,333
it go for a while before yeah

896
00:31:04,333 --> 00:31:05,790
yeah you don't want to wait for

897
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:07,080
some people no no no i would

898
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,102
not i'm not going to be early

899
00:31:08,102 --> 00:31:09,510
to teleport to the first guy who's

900
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:10,530
going to do tell but okay the

901
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:12,150
first guy whatever but the first person

902
00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:13,470
who pays for it ooh

903
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:15,510
i can't imagine being that but they'll

904
00:31:15,521 --> 00:31:17,400
probably example way into nothingness i remember

905
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,170
seeming well it's not even possible is

906
00:31:19,171 --> 00:31:21,480
a teleportation possible while your particles have

907
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,500
to become little and then they get

908
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:24,030
sent through a tube but i wonder

909
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:25,380
okay so if you if you did

910
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:27,420
it okay stay male your articles say

911
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:29,130
you're thinking about teleportation in the way

912
00:31:29,130 --> 00:31:31,290
of they they dissemble your particles and

913
00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:33,810
then reassemble them somewhere else right instantaneous

914
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:34,860
mostly but what if they did it

915
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:36,450
like a fold in time where it's

916
00:31:36,450 --> 00:31:38,700
like you don't dissemble you just step

917
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:40,800
through like a doorway that there are

918
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:44,220
different dimensions ones happening right now ah

919
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:46,620
jimmy and other earths another language like

920
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:48,840
another dimension another dimension the dimension do

921
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:51,300
you mean like multiple realities or i

922
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:53,940
mean yes the multiverse

923
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,470
and that you could go to another

924
00:31:55,470 --> 00:31:57,360
reality and be in like japan right

925
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,080
now no

926
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:02,130
sucks i also do not believe in

927
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:03,870
that i like it i think it's

928
00:32:03,870 --> 00:32:05,400
pretty like you think there's another lauren

929
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,990
who's know i guess i just think

930
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:08,940
it's cool to think about another dimension

931
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:12,120
maybe with not another me but another

932
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:15,090
version of the world without you in

933
00:32:15,090 --> 00:32:16,530
that time yeah how could you even

934
00:32:16,530 --> 00:32:18,150
imagine we said well i mean a

935
00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:18,840
lot of them

936
00:32:19,410 --> 00:32:20,880
that's the weird part about anytime you

937
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:23,700
see science fiction with you know multiverse

938
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:25,920
kind of things is everyone's in everyone

939
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,870
has a slight change like we only

940
00:32:27,870 --> 00:32:29,850
wear button downs i ever go che

941
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:32,190
yeah but it's really like most of

942
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:33,540
the dimensions wouldn't even have you in

943
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:35,100
it yeah they'd be like bugs like

944
00:32:35,130 --> 00:32:37,170
ruling the world or something well also

945
00:32:37,170 --> 00:32:39,090
just like your parents would not have

946
00:32:39,090 --> 00:32:39,570
had sex

947
00:32:39,570 --> 00:32:41,220
ks at that particular time

948
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:45,690
how do they have sex laura

949
00:32:46,950 --> 00:32:47,790
but you know what i mean like

950
00:32:47,790 --> 00:32:49,200
the only reason that you are who

951
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,610
you are is because they had sex

952
00:32:50,670 --> 00:32:53,310
at that rate one instant you would

953
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:54,870
have been a total different person isn't

954
00:32:54,870 --> 00:32:56,760
that cool any other time i think

955
00:32:56,790 --> 00:32:59,040
but there would be more blimps yeah

956
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:00,840
that's true but i'm saying to stop

957
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:04,800
lamps me just stop you just was

958
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,270
like female blimps like a month ago

959
00:33:06,450 --> 00:33:08,640
you shouldn't let your cancelled blimps cancelled

960
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,410
i know what is your what is

961
00:33:10,410 --> 00:33:12,210
your issue there are ways to bare

962
00:33:12,210 --> 00:33:13,890
a waste of all hot air

963
00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:17,430
they are diverting resources that we desperately

964
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:19,770
need for balloon when have you ever

965
00:33:19,770 --> 00:33:21,510
seen a blimp that made sense or

966
00:33:21,510 --> 00:33:24,240
knew needed the blood the goodyear blimp

967
00:33:24,270 --> 00:33:25,710

972
00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:35,250
huge advertisement they could put hay

973
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:36,390
hey guys a good year is it's

974
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:37,650

on even tire since like gas something

977
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:42,480
i don't even know that would be

978
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,710
great if it was on that readout

979
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:45,120

radius strange that people don't you know

982
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,420
i mean when the goodyear blimp was

983
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:53,280
invented everyone knew what good year was

984
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,450
because they were used to putting on

985
00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:55,320
their own tires

986
00:33:55,770 --> 00:33:58,984
and now people oil tar butlers so

987
00:33:59,010 --> 00:34:00,000
am i don't why do i need

988
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,280
to know about goodyear tires if i'm

989
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:03,510
going to get new tires do i

990
00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:04,620
go to a tire shop and go

991
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:06,930
to show this is my point store

992
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,070
this is my point is we used

993
00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:09,180
to put that we used to go

994
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:10,860
by the tires i'm still trying to

995
00:34:10,890 --> 00:34:12,240
take them home and put them on

996
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:13,560
ourselves and you are born in coop

997
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:15,390
was a star of the sky

998
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:18,090
but you but i'm saying you you

999
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:19,470
go to a store and you don't

1000
00:34:19,470 --> 00:34:21,383
care and someone points out attire yeah

1001
00:34:21,450 --> 00:34:23,130
whatever whatever and you don't care what

1002
00:34:23,130 --> 00:34:24,420
brand it is or whatever or they

1003
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:27,210
don't that's the point that's my point

1004
00:34:27,210 --> 00:34:28,020
that's why i need good year so

1005
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:28,920
i say i need a good year

1006
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:32,010
tire i seen the blimp i saw

1007
00:34:32,010 --> 00:34:33,690
a lamp over the football game i

1008
00:34:33,690 --> 00:34:35,730
like blimps and

1009
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:38,250
i wanna go ride in one because

1010
00:34:38,252 --> 00:34:40,440
i think it would be terrifying why

1011
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,360
i hear the hot air balloon is

1012
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:44,340
terrifying oh hot air balloon is fucked

1013
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:47,130
up how did they land the blimp

1014
00:34:47,130 --> 00:34:49,200
i mean the blimp this just handed

1015
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:50,250
down yeah they just said it to

1016
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:53,160
anyone deflates yeah they broke a hole

1017
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:54,630
in it and because

1018
00:34:55,650 --> 00:34:56,640
i think it's the same way they

1019
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:58,860
land any other aircrafts like they have

1020
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:01,050
to they make a gentleman foolish is

1021
00:35:01,050 --> 00:35:03,300
that well a big blimp running down

1022
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:05,430
and runway and then taking off has

1023
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:07,110
anyone ever seen a bland to take

1024
00:35:07,110 --> 00:35:08,730
off i don't think it runs other

1025
00:35:08,730 --> 00:35:10,380
i think it's i think just really

1026
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:13,170
low rates loud airing and then it's

1027
00:35:13,170 --> 00:35:14,430
up so

1028
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,530
can even go anywhere why do we

1029
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,570
have this it goes all over the

1030
00:35:18,570 --> 00:35:20,220
place alright i don't like our i

1031
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:22,320

1033
00:35:25,170 --> 00:35:29,310
alternative method of travel or something that

1034
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:31,680
that somehow got abandoned and is actually

1035
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,240
what they were gonna just comical put

1036
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:34,620
people up in the blimp part and

1037
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:34,770

1038
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:35,730

for the way you want me on

1158
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:45,600
that wall speech from a few minutes

00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:00,240
out of my pocket and she burst

1164
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:02,160
into tears like she had no idea

1165
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,810
at the prospect she had no at

1166
00:40:03,810 --> 00:40:05,730
prosecuting marijuana then i talked her into

1167
00:40:05,730 --> 00:40:07,530
it i was like here's the pros

1168
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:07,620
and

1169
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:11,400
you bought a long list yeah she

1170
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:12,870
she i do agree the pros outweigh

1171
00:40:12,870 --> 00:40:14,940
the cons lot of cons but there

1172
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:17,100
was one more pro that's right it

1173
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:17,790
was a real squeaker

1174
00:40:19,770 --> 00:40:23,880
sweet um and how long until you

1175
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,710
got married was seven months or so

1176
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:27,780
how long it was almost a year

1177
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:29,580
because we we knew we wanted to

1178
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:31,830
get married in south carolina but there's

1179
00:40:31,830 --> 00:40:34,290
a very narrow window of time when

1180
00:40:34,290 --> 00:40:35,340
you can do that where the weather

1181
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:38,550
isn't either dangerous or miserable and so

1182
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:39,090
we had to wait

1183
00:40:39,090 --> 00:40:42,510
wait like you know another we will

1184
00:40:42,524 --> 00:40:43,590
be doing in the springtime so we'd

1185
00:40:43,653 --> 00:40:45,300
wait a year yeah biggest regret of

1186
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:46,620
my life that i didn't make it

i think

1213
00:41:45,355 --> 00:41:46,585
i think that

1214
00:41:47,635 --> 00:41:49,945
she she because we have a lot

1215
00:41:49,945 --> 00:41:51,475
of friends who are not able to

1216
00:41:51,475 --> 00:41:52,825
be there or we weren't friends with

1217
00:41:52,825 --> 00:41:54,565
them yet i just think she wants

1218
00:41:54,565 --> 00:41:56,155
me to express my love for her

1219
00:41:56,155 --> 00:41:57,535
in front of people again yeah because

1220
00:41:57,535 --> 00:41:59,455
i don't see it that way

1221
00:42:00,205 --> 00:42:01,915
yeah your very own love that's why

1222
00:42:01,915 --> 00:42:02,935

1223
00:42:02,935 --> 00:42:05,065

1226
00:42:07,885 --> 00:42:09,535
it clear when i know you only

1227
00:42:09,535 --> 00:42:11,245
made the joke because i felt like

1228
00:42:11,245 --> 00:42:13,195
it was revere enough that you are

1229
00:42:13,825 --> 00:42:15,175

1230
00:42:15,175 --> 00:42:17,275
mean sometimes we have friends who like

1231
00:42:18,325 --> 00:42:19,765
they constantly have

1232
00:42:19,825 --> 00:42:21,265
parties and i think they're always looking

1233
00:42:21,265 --> 00:42:23,155
for an excuse our party i'm already

1234
00:42:23,155 --> 00:42:24,505
so you know what i mean where

1235
00:42:24,505 --> 00:42:27,055
it's like any life thing that happens

1236
00:42:27,055 --> 00:42:28,347
is like let's have a big party

1237
00:42:28,347 --> 00:42:29,545
and i'm like oh you guys just

1238
00:42:29,545 --> 00:42:31,615
like having parties what i think cool

up just just wants that like expression

1240
00:42:35,545 --> 00:42:37,525
of place why did you get married

what was the date again september thirteenth

1244
00:42:46,885 --> 00:42:49,735
um well i think you that's enough

1245
00:42:49,735 --> 00:42:50,965
time where it makes sense to do

1246
00:42:50,965 --> 00:42:52,465
a renewal of vows it's not like

1247
00:42:52,465 --> 00:42:55,645
it was only maybe twenty twenty

1248
00:42:56,965 --> 00:42:58,225
where ours is but you know when

1249
00:42:58,255 --> 00:42:59,515

a third to say ah we talk

1253
00:43:06,355 --> 00:43:07,585
about it because there are so many

1254
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:09,175
people that are in our lives now

1255
00:43:09,205 --> 00:43:10,945
that we're not when we got married

1256
00:43:10,945 --> 00:43:12,385

1258
00:43:14,005 --> 00:43:16,015
people because they're important to our lives

1259
00:43:16,045 --> 00:43:16,915
here's what i think about

1260
00:43:16,945 --> 00:43:19,465
this now you go scott for you

1261
00:43:19,465 --> 00:43:22,015

00:43:22,015 --> 00:43:24,895
me don't say twenty because you'll regret

1263
00:43:24,895 --> 00:43:27,020
that do it if it won't because

1264
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:28,735

1353
00:46:21,655 --> 00:46:23,965
a beginning thing and then i realized

immediately like i didn't plan anything else

1355
00:46:26,005 --> 00:46:27,865
out yeah beef up the middle of

1356
00:46:27,865 --> 00:46:29,785

1357
00:46:29,785 --> 00:46:30,355
interesting how

1358
00:46:30,355 --> 00:46:31,525
having been on that side now the

1359
00:46:31,525 --> 00:46:34,435
nerves of it are so intense that

1360
00:46:34,435 --> 00:46:35,995
it's like it's crazy it's like yeah

1361
00:46:36,055 --> 00:46:37,825
i was so nervous all day yeah

1362
00:46:37,855 --> 00:46:39,295
i wasn't probably being normal like i

1363
00:46:39,295 --> 00:46:40,675
was just thinking like oh i really

1364
00:46:40,675 --> 00:46:41,905
want to yeah and so it was

1365
00:46:41,905 --> 00:46:44,515
like it's a really specific feeling yeah

1366
00:46:44,545 --> 00:46:47,245
yeah yeah crazy yeah how did you

1367
00:46:47,275 --> 00:46:49,405
do it again you told oh god

1368
00:46:49,405 --> 00:46:50,449
stories oh

1369
00:46:50,515 --> 00:46:52,225
yeah you know andriy i'd go to

1370
00:46:52,225 --> 00:46:54,175
canada i mean yeah we know and

1371
00:46:54,175 --> 00:46:55,315
like lonely island i was on a

1372
00:46:55,315 --> 00:46:55,645
boat

1373
00:46:57,085 --> 00:46:59,275
yeah like lonely island also like no

1374
00:46:59,275 --> 00:47:01,405
when god drowned the world so like

1375
00:47:01,405 --> 00:47:02,665
paul in a month when he goes

1376
00:47:02,665 --> 00:47:06,085
to solomon island that's right up there

1377
00:47:06,085 --> 00:47:09,445
with south carolina the southeast of carolina's

1378
00:47:09,475 --> 00:47:13,975
florin lee's um yeah wind it was

1379
00:47:13,975 --> 00:47:16,915
yours it's served it is very nerve

1380
00:47:17,005 --> 00:47:18,895
i don't know because it's not like

1381
00:47:19,735 --> 00:47:21,625
i wonder why is that it's not

1382
00:47:21,625 --> 00:47:22,885
like they're gonna say no although the

1383
00:47:22,885 --> 00:47:26,005
people who say no i wonder about

1384
00:47:26,005 --> 00:47:28,345
the person who's asking like i wonder

1385
00:47:28,345 --> 00:47:30,505
about their mental state like how would

1386
00:47:30,505 --> 00:47:31,915
i mean how is a point that

1387
00:47:31,915 --> 00:47:34,765
was viable the whole like she said

1388
00:47:34,765 --> 00:47:37,075
yes if there's a question may

1389
00:47:37,075 --> 00:47:39,535
maybe don't die nobody also think oh

1390
00:47:39,563 --> 00:47:41,065
you're the people that are surprised at

1391
00:47:41,065 --> 00:47:43,345
the person said yes yeah and if

1392
00:47:43,345 --> 00:47:45,535
i know conversely the people who say

1393
00:47:45,535 --> 00:47:47,065
no i think about the people who

1394
00:47:47,065 --> 00:47:48,895
asked like what are you even doing

1395
00:47:48,955 --> 00:47:50,485
but i think that if the person

1396
00:47:50,485 --> 00:47:52,645
says no i think that can oftentimes

1397
00:47:52,645 --> 00:47:54,895
be a wakeup call because it was

1398
00:47:54,895 --> 00:47:57,145
so much pressure on knowledge presented yeah

1399
00:47:57,265 --> 00:47:58,615
like well now that you ask i

1400
00:47:58,615 --> 00:48:00,445
guess no but but idea of saying

1401
00:48:00,445 --> 00:48:01,945
no instantly like i feel like i

1402
00:48:01,945 --> 00:48:03,385
can imagine the world where someone says

1403
00:48:03,385 --> 00:48:04,764
yes and then like two days later

1404
00:48:04,764 --> 00:48:05,785
like it's like by the way oh

1405
00:48:05,995 --> 00:48:07,405
yeah i actually know someone that has

1406
00:48:07,405 --> 00:48:08,725
she said yes and then i know

1407
00:48:08,725 --> 00:48:09,805
i know people that's happened to you

1408
00:48:09,805 --> 00:48:10,975
and then they got married later yeah

1409
00:48:11,575 --> 00:48:13,285
well yeah i know people love each

1410
00:48:13,285 --> 00:48:13,615

00:48:17,755 --> 00:48:20,065

life without you and the only way

01:02:32,685 --> 01:02:34,215
to make buildings out of it so

1776
01:02:34,215 --> 01:02:36,105
they make an apartment building out of

1777
01:02:36,105 --> 01:02:38,355
this and anyone who goes into this

1778
01:02:38,355 --> 01:02:40,365
apartment building has to tell the truth

1779
01:02:40,365 --> 01:02:42,045
and it's like big bang theory but

1780
01:02:42,075 --> 01:02:43,935
what if the roommates like big bang

1781
01:02:43,935 --> 01:02:45,195
theory is like big bang theory but

1782
01:02:45,225 --> 01:02:45,486
that was

1783
01:02:45,585 --> 01:02:47,835
yes i'm listening but you know how

1784
01:02:47,835 --> 01:02:49,485
so many other episodes are about like

1785
01:02:49,485 --> 01:02:50,895
people lying to each other and covering

1786
01:02:50,895 --> 01:02:52,665
up truth what if they couldn't do

1787
01:02:52,665 --> 01:02:55,515
that like the movie liar liar where

exactly yeah in a weird strange so

1791
01:03:02,325 --> 01:03:03,795
what if it was big bang theory

1792
01:03:03,795 --> 01:03:05,055
where everyone told the truth to each

1793
01:03:05,055 --> 01:03:05,745
