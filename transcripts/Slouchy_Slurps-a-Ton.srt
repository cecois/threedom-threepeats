129
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:30,120
before i felt like people were annoying

130
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,980
when i talked about it and i

131
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,330
was like whatever do it everyone and

132
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:34,620

133
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:36,150

like look at how everything is organized

188
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:21,000
i just like i love seeing all

189
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,010
the supplies it's like yeah here's all

190
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:24,480
the things that you need and there

191
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,550
you love imagining the owner of the

192
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:27,060
store

193
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,790
like making his order list yeah yeah

194
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:31,500
we need more racers it's like i

195
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,730
need a pen i have plenty of

196
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:34,560
pins i like the i love those

197
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,520
stores too they remind me of going

198
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,780
back to school which is a good

199
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:38,970
feeling going back to school for me

200
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:41,340
was like i liked the idea of

201
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:44,190
buying things like getting notebooks and stuff

202
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:46,410
like that pencils but it was also

203
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,280
it was bittersweet

204
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,290
because i was going back to school

205
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:51,540
duty if you guys could go back

206
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:54,360
to school for a year like high

207
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:57,690
school like knowing what you know now

208
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,220
i don't even know if like you'd

209
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:01,980
be transported into like just say that

210
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:04,470
it's adults like every every adult gets

211
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,970
there there's a there's a high school

212
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:07,440
for adults and ever

213
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,550
one gets to go for one year

214
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:11,400
i don't know what in what situation

215
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,748
this is but just like everyone's an

216
00:07:12,748 --> 00:07:14,700
adult it's not like you're sitting right

217
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:15,600
but you get to do all the

218
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,620
things that you did in high school

219
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:17,919
you get to do prom you get

220
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:20,280
you get to have electives i probably

221
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:22,260
have way more fun i think they

222
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,790
probably learn more and i would learn

223
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:25,380
more i think i was thinking the

224
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:26,460
other day that i could like i

225
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:27,480
think i could crush the

226
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,700
s a t s now what was

227
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,620
cool about that sometimes i don't want

228
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:35,070
to share ah noi score wasn't horrible

229
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:36,900
but i didn't study ever i didn't

230
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:37,980
like to prepare for them i got

231
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:40,140
eleven seventy on the team that's good

232
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:41,537
but i didn't i didn't study and

233
00:07:41,537 --> 00:07:42,630
i like like that like i got

234
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:44,040
a twenty eight and the eighty without

235
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:44,790
studying at all

236
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:46,890
but i think if i were to

237
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,510
do it i if i were to

238
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:50,370
do it now and try and care

239
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,660
because yeah you did you'd have a

240
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:53,040
goal and now we're yet to actually

241
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,900
achieving goals yeah back when we were

242
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,460
young it was like oh god gold

243
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:57,330
and now everyone has to say what

244
00:07:57,330 --> 00:07:59,910
they got on those tests right yeah

245
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:02,610
i've i honestly i don't remember what

246
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:04,320
i got my cds but i remember

247
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,310
i did pretty well

248
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,050
yeah but same thing like i didn't

249
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:09,290
really study much for it because i

250
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:11,910
was always good at tests like that

251
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:13,560
yeah yeah i was always i was

252
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:16,320
always good with like just deductive reasoning

253
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:18,450
eliminating options and you know that kind

254
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:20,550
of thing yeah but um but yeah

255
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:24,840
i don't remember i got thirteen ninety

256
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:25,680
that's good which

257
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:27,660
and i never the other thing about

258
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:29,550
high schools i realised i never actually

259
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:30,990
read a book or i think on

260
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:32,190
one of our previous episodes i was

261
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:33,540
talking about how i just carried every

262
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:34,770
book i needed and i never went

263
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:36,030
to my locker but i also never

264
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:38,730
read a book in high school and

265
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:40,470
like literature like books you were assigned

266
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,460
books i was a sign i never

267
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:43,110
read them i just know i would

268
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:45,210
pass the tests by like listening to

269
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:45,840
the teacher talk

270
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,980
talk about them and kind of like

271
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:48,540
gleaning what i needed to know about

272
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:49,290
him and then i would write a

273
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:51,510
report did you try reading books and

274
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:52,350
then you're like i don't want to

275
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:54,450
do this the books that they were

276
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:56,910
giving us oh i'm i'm sure i'm

277
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:58,410
interested in them now like you know

278
00:08:58,410 --> 00:08:59,790
i don't know nineteen eighty four heart

279
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:00,930
of darkness i don't even know if

280
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:02,520
i still could read it but um

281
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:03,540
you know what i mean i just

282
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:05,040
wasn't i was interested in doing my

283
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,000
thing i was doing

284
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:08,340
my thing did you read books that

285
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:10,740
you chose at that time when i

286
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:13,050
was in high school not read although

287
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:14,280
i did read plays and stuff because

288
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,170
i was doing theater i probably i

289
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:17,790
you know what when i went to

290
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:20,280
college when i was twenty ah when

291
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,320
i went to my theater college the

292
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:24,630
my shakespeare instructor was saying was said

293
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:26,160
to me you're obviously very well read

294
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,960
read because i when i was young

295
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,240
i read a lot and then i

296
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,040
really didn't from junior high to high

297
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,510
school we talked a lot about encyclopedia

298
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:33,870
brown

299
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:38,730
great brain obviously really well read but

300
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:40,860
but um did you say bugs meany

301
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:41,700
i know who that is

302
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:45,510
but but i thought to myself oh

303
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:47,370
gosh i'm just faking it and so

304
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:48,930
then then i would go to like

305
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:51,630
used bookstores and buy all the classics

306
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:53,190
and then try to read them right

307
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:55,020
and so i have a whole you

308
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:57,360
know ah bookshelves filled with just like

309
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,720
classic novels of which i've read half

310
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,370
like i got really into

311
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:06,260
ah nabokov or nabokov however you say

312
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:09,290
it and i got into nato cove

313
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:13,280
i got into kafka and kafka dostoevsky

314
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:13,940
is like

315
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:17,180
but um but then i would try

316
00:10:17,210 --> 00:10:18,980
i've had this like giant book of

317
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:23,000
plato for four years for twenty five

318
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,380
years that i bought a used bookstore

319
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:26,120
and i finally recently was like never

320
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,560
gonna read it throwing it away yeah

321
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,880
like it's just not interesting to me

322
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,050
sometimes it's nice to get rid of

323
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:31,400
those things you know you're never going

324
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,410
to crack into because then it stops

325
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:34,760
becoming like a weight on you like

326
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:35,150
young

327
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:37,730
damn supposed to do that i eliminated

328
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,800
a lot of books from my home

329
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:42,530
because i realized i don't i'm never

330
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:44,270
going to read these again and i

331
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:46,490
don't care about displaying them to people

332
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:47,180
you know what i mean so we

333
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:49,910
have we have one book bookcase in

334
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:52,850
our home and it's got like um

335
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:54,200
you know it's a lot of books

336
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:54,830
by

337
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:56,980
there there's a number of books that

338
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:58,850
i haven't read yet that are there

339
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:00,320
but then also wants i gotta i

340
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:03,920
you know with with technology like reading

341
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:06,920
an actual book flesh and blood book

342
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:08,000
is i haven't done it in such

343
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,010
a long i prefer it though i

344
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:12,080
do to and for every two yeah

345
00:11:12,110 --> 00:11:13,370
then on the ipad although when i'm

346
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:15,170
on vacation the ipad is some but

347
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:15,500

no i don't know i really feel

349
00:11:16,906 --> 00:11:17,930
like i read a lot more when

350
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:19,550
i have the actual book but yeah

351
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:21,020
and it's and it also feels like

352
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:22,940
a break from the phone and computer

353
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:24,560
lab somewhere when i'm doing the apex

354
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,930
yeah i'm still like ruining my brain

355
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,510
yeah i don't know which ah which

356
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:31,010
things would you enjoy doing in high

357
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:32,330
school that if you could do it

358
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:34,940
again like would you would you do

359
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:35,630
the exact same

360
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:37,550
things like what what were some of

361
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:40,100
the electives learned that use um theater

362
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:41,810
so would you do theater ghana or

363
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:43,580
does that seem like work now i

364
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:45,500
think i would because it'd be fun

365
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:46,580
like i think and you'd be a

366
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:49,370
sti best and people because she's on

367
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:51,560
horses sidewise voted best actress among a

368
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:54,110
yearbook really voted best actor oh good

369
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,853
i wasn't voted in most likely due

370
00:11:57,853 --> 00:11:58,670

405
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:03,920
what's it called jamo

406
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:06,950
was based on the northwest based on

407
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:08,750
the michael mcdonald song yah mo b

408
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,730
there of course now is based on

409
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:12,368
the northwestern show which is of the

410
00:13:12,368 --> 00:13:13,968
same thing like wamu or something so

411
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:18,260
guys are spelled y a ammo okay

412
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:21,800
um and what's wow it's like the

413
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:24,320
northwestern sketch show that that we like

414
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:25,100
in the same town

415
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:26,510
so it was like our version of

416
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:27,680
that or so i don't know why

417
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:29,180
i'm west of the mississippi so i

418
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,770
have no idea where you're okay i

419
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:33,590
don't even know either um but it

420
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:36,230
was like our special show because like

421
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:38,840
i directed at my senior year oh

422
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:42,134
really you win best director then because

423
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:42,620
i wasn't

424
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:46,370
um that wasn't an option nobody was

425
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:48,200
very like special show but so all

426
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,430
the kids like to cover that show

427
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:51,020
and so i think more probably students

428
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:52,160
went to that show more than to

429
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,960
the other show because probably more community

430
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,100
people seen and you were in it

431
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,390
as well as terrain yeah i was

432
00:13:56,402 --> 00:13:57,590
in it do you remember the bits

433
00:13:57,590 --> 00:13:59,840
that you did where they skip yeah

434
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:01,070
i was in one where i was

435
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:03,980
like a really bad school photographer at

436
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:05,510
and i just like made everyone look

437
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:07,280
awful in their pictures did you write

438
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,720
it was this a written things written

439
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,430
by students so i was when i

440
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:11,630
was in it i didn't write it

441
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:13,130
and then when i like as a

442
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:15,230
senior i wrote one thing i think

443
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:15,680
got it

444
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:19,220
was it open to all classes or

445
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:21,230
just the upper class know everyone okay

446
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:23,180
and were the sketches funny like that

447
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:24,500
the kids wrote yeah we always thought

448
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,730
it was a great show i mean

449
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:26,600
it was so this year was the

450
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,700
sixtieth anniversary i was invited to go

451
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:29,930
back but i couldn't go because it

452
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,460
oh ne and i was really sick

453
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:34,130
oh and i sent a video but

454
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:35,090
then like ah like there are a

455
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:36,449
lot of people kind of high school

456
00:14:36,449 --> 00:14:36,830
who are

457
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:38,570
famous like yeah jessie mueller who's like

458
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:41,120
opposite way and she was carole king

459
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,070
and the beautiful musical she's a broadway

460
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:46,100
star she's she's investigating donald trump for

461
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:46,430
truth

462
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,920
rush their whole family is all like

463
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:50,450
actors so i think they took over

464
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:53,690
the show um which is great but

465
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:55,190
they ah but i was sad to

466
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:56,540
miss it because i would love to

467
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:57,980
see the the current class jokes i

468
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:00,650
have no idea that's the thing outside

469
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:02,120
of my age you know me after

470
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:05,630
i left my school ah theater programs

471
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:07,340
i would maybe a couple of

472
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:09,470
times i would go back for a

473
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:11,330
few years after and they always looked

474
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,010
kind of small and ricky dank but

475
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:14,750
when you're in them they feel giant

476
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:16,640
and like yeah i think i mentioned

477
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:17,840
this on off book like the the

478
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,550
shows the two shows that i saw

479
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:21,620
before i got into high school with

480
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:23,900
that were at the high school theatre

481
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,250
department that i wanted to be in

482
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:27,230

483
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:27,500
the best

484
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,090
shows i've ever seen me relax i

485
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:30,320

486
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:32,600
actors in my school being amazing yeah

actor i'd ever seen him i've just

490
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:40,190
i'm so curious like i think they

491
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:41,870
were legitimately good like alot of them

492
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:43,280
went on to do like things and

493
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:45,020
whatever but i was just transported like

494
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,120

i don't know we never know i

498
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:53,750
guess i thought that i that i

499
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:56,240
was amazing when i was in those

500
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,250
plays and watching them years later on

501
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:01,042

502
00:16:01,042 --> 00:16:02,480

503
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,280
my god i gotta have anything i

504
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:06,410
got to digitize them because i want

505
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:07,700
to watch all of them

506
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:09,590
a lot of my choir performances

507
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,980
oh my god i was inquired to

508
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:14,810
so obviously looking back at it i'm

509
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:16,640
like oh i'm just like every other

510
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:20,900
high school actor where talking very slowly

511
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:22,100
well i think i feel like when

512
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:23,720
you feel better than other people when

513
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,610
yeah when you're in high school isn't

514
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:28,040
it just like whoever can overcome their

515
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:30,816
shyness to be outgoing yeah you know

516
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:32,360
i mean is like but there was

517
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:35,240
there was a difference between you know

518
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,910
people that could you could tell when

519
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:40,460
somebody was a was a good performer

520
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:43,190
right like those standard yeah yeah someone

521
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:46,490
who's like a professional bad actor yeah

522
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,780
you know like oh wow they're saying

523
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:50,450
their lines they're projecting their seem like

524
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:51,020
very specif

525
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:52,340
think about what they're doing but i've

526
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:54,080
never been invited back to my school

527
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,060
for any alumni things right because they've

528
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:57,710
done alumni shows and stuff like that

529
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:59,360
oh crazy but here's why i think

530
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:03,110
because it was a catholic school i'm

531
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:06,410
very clearly not catholic anymore right i've

532
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:08,330
never given money to the school right

533
00:17:08,330 --> 00:17:09,920
and i don't care about the school

534
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:14,090
that still watch any advice you should

535
00:17:14,090 --> 00:17:15,860
be excited i'm i think that is

536
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:17,270
weird so i can turn them down

537
00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:18,530
and get won't give you opportunity to

538
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:20,330
not turn them down right or you

539
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:22,550
like whoa maybe i should i just

540
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:24,620

the waiters were all kind of close

619
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,770
like we would have a christmas party

00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:53,510
and everyone would go and everyone would

621
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:55,280
sing karaoke we would always hang out

622
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:58,400
together and all this so our favorite

623
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:02,000
manager was having a birth either his

624
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,450
like fiftieth birthday or his like anniversary

625
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:06,680
with the company i don't recall what

626
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:06,860
it was

627
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:09,960
so we did we we had a

628
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,670
surprise party for him

629
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:14,340
where we put on a show

630
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:18,540
oh wow and so weird and there's

631
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:20,610
so much we we loved him i

632
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:21,930
actually went over to his house once

633
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:23,580
and with like three other people and

634
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:24,960
watch the odd couple because he was

635
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,640
like you only know you only know

636
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,380
the the tv show you gotta watch

637
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:29,640
the original film i'd never seen the

638
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,740
original film so we went over you

639
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:32,670
tell us how suck

640
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:34,470
i was waiting for it

641
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:37,740
no but we we i remember me

642
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:38,940
and a bunch of the other waiters

643
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:41,520
did the song officer krupp key from

644
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:46,110
west side story his name ah manager

645
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:49,380
mill yeah i think it was simply

646
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:51,330
because he liked the fact that so

647
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:52,860
many of us had done musical theater

648
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:54,720
and he was like always walking around

649
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,710
singing songs or what

650
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:56,640
ever and we're like we'll do a

651
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,560
song for him that's cute but the

652
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,690
weird part about it was was that

653
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:04,470
um two of the people involved one

654
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:06,810
of them had had it had just

655
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:08,190
come out that he had started sleeping

656
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:10,410
with the other one's wife oh and

657
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:10,770
they

658
00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:13,590
and it was a big scandal and

659
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:15,750
then and then i would think that

660
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:18,450
one of them drop out they still

661
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:19,740
did the show they still did the

662
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:21,780
show and we rehearsed it together and

663
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,280
like during the rehearsals they would like

664
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,750
split up and walk away from each

665
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,160
other and like not talk to each

666
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,290
other like hey i'm sorry cram yes

667
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:31,200
yeah what are you doing it's sane

668
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:31,980
when i think about

669
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:32,970
it it like it's one of the

670
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:37,200

908
00:29:58,500 --> 00:29:59,670
a bunch of those sicher not on

909
00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:01,170
the show on on my show we

910
00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:02,610
had a bunch of those situations with

911
00:30:02,610 --> 00:30:04,260
like teeth yeah it's crazy i had

912
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:05,790
a bunch to my school it's the

913
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:07,800
teachers that get rid of orange juice

914
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,840
freaks me out but you could never

915
00:30:09,870 --> 00:30:10,140
reach

916
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:13,177
and do anything really weird i feel

917
00:30:13,177 --> 00:30:14,620
like if you and my parents never

918
00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:16,480
prepared me for anything like that but

919
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,100
i feel like you do you have

920
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:19,240
to talk to your kids and say

921
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:22,150
like by the way chances are good

922
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:23,260
there's going to be a teacher who's

923
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:24,940
gonna creep you out and do such

924
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:27,460
and such a thing immediately tell someone

925
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:30,040
i know because i knew it when

926
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:30,850
like i would be

927
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,410
it was drilled into us when we

928
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,910
when we were walking to school anyone

929
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:35,560
any stranger offers to give you a

930
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:37,660
ride yeah say no that happened to

931
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:39,880
me i said no call the police

932
00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:41,230
you know they tried to track him

933
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:42,910
down all that but you know you

934
00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:44,500
never heard about teachers like by the

935
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:45,790
way if a teacher ever does is

936
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:47,260
i know and they can do things

937
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:49,630
that are so like they you could

938
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:50,950
just write off as being like

939
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:52,600
that was weird you know but yeah

940
00:30:52,651 --> 00:30:53,770
yeah when you look back at i

941
00:30:53,770 --> 00:30:55,690
actually really inappropriate or like that made

942
00:30:55,690 --> 00:30:57,280
me really uncomfortable but i didn't know

943
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,720
i didn't have the language to like

944
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:01,690
yeah you know yeah because because you're

945
00:31:01,690 --> 00:31:03,040
experiencing it for the first time and

946
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,330
no one is talking about it yeah

947
00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:06,460
i was very naive back then of

948
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:08,860
course i was raised with religion as

949
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:11,110
well and i think bye bye

950
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,390
parents who came from an age of

951
00:31:13,870 --> 00:31:15,382
adults are to be trusted you know

952
00:31:15,382 --> 00:31:16,330
what i mean like i don't and

953
00:31:16,330 --> 00:31:17,680
they're always in the right yeah and

954
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,540
i'm sure we got some talk about

955
00:31:19,570 --> 00:31:21,070
beware of strangers or whatever but i

956
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:23,770
don't remember that but i never got

957
00:31:23,770 --> 00:31:26,050
into any situation like that where i

958
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:27,760
had to even where even came close

959
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,170
for like a weird thing to happen

960
00:31:29,410 --> 00:31:31,390
but i do when i think about

961
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:33,040
it it now it's like there's so

962
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:35,140
many fucked up adults that you have

963
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,894
that you encounter in your life yeah

964
00:31:36,910 --> 00:31:40,810
child that i but i don't it

965
00:31:40,810 --> 00:31:43,240
wasn't like the the idea was not

966
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:45,160
even it wasn't even an idea that

967
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:47,650
a teacher could do something wrong right

968
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:50,290
but it was happening ensure i don't

969
00:31:50,290 --> 00:31:51,550

970
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:53,440

get rid of that way it's one

1026
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:09,100
of the things most efficient it's one

1027
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:11,980
of the things that disproves evolution when

1028
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:13,090
it feels like we're the better when

1029
00:34:13,090 --> 00:34:17,410
it's haven't evolved much my entire life

1030

i although oh right exactly yeah when

1031
00:34:19,810 --> 00:34:20,350
the handles

a guy name

1155
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:42,250
john you didn't man it was it

1156
00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:44,140
was illegal to marry him so tom

1157
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:45,370
moore said i married cool

1158
00:38:47,770 --> 00:38:50,080
second best was the only reason why

1159
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:52,810
you are married by him though iowa

1160
00:38:52,810 --> 00:38:54,700
yeah yeah well he can say he

1161
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:56,530
married you that's true and i married

1162
00:38:56,530 --> 00:38:58,600
him technically because i married him newer

1163
00:38:58,750 --> 00:39:00,580
yes so that's true there we go

1164
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,800
yeah i mean he is so clue

1165
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,480
nice this a friend of ours he's

1166
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,801
very tall that's why people call him

1167
00:39:05,830 --> 00:39:06,640
tal joe he likes

1168
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:08,140
it though it's not like us denigrating

1169
00:39:08,170 --> 00:39:11,590
how policy ah six i believe

1170
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:14,770
eight or nine i cheese it's like

1171
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:16,120
right over the limit where he he

1172
00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:18,610
he technically is viewed as a giant

1173
00:39:18,610 --> 00:39:19,930
by the airlines so you can like

1174
00:39:19,930 --> 00:39:22,570
demand i say yeah yeah i think

1175
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:24,340
i think that's the actual term weight

1176
00:39:24,490 --> 00:39:27,280
the airlines are are using these terms

1177
00:39:27,310 --> 00:39:29,890
yes so what can demand first-class for

1178
00:39:29,890 --> 00:39:31,780
our giant customers hi you're welcome to

1179
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:32,767
board i think

1180
00:39:32,830 --> 00:39:34,600
it's like a certain type of seats

1181
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:36,651
on the airline or something like that

1182
00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:38,020
and it has to yeah i can't

1183
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:39,790
i can't recall exactly what it is

1184
00:39:39,790 --> 00:39:42,190
but yeah i'm not sure yeah i'm

1185
00:39:42,190 --> 00:39:44,320
not very love that yeah you're not

1186
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,030
there yet know you think you're not

1187
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:48,220
growing you're gonna keep going till i

1188
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:50,530
wonder if people just decide to stop

1189
00:39:50,530 --> 00:39:52,600
growing oh that's heavy

1190
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:54,340
you know what i mean like i'm

1191
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:56,860
tall enough not mean i'd like to

1192
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:59,170
be there probably tall people who would

1193
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:02,620
argue the opposite that they grew way

1194
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:04,390
passed upon way past i you know

1195
00:40:04,390 --> 00:40:07,180
hold up now lauren you're tall are

1196
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:09,760
you talking about yourself i'm not do

1197
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,410
you like being the hey i'm fine

1198
00:40:11,410 --> 00:40:12,718
with my i don't really think of

1199
00:40:12,744 --> 00:40:13,150
being tall

1200
00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:15,490
and but people well pointed out to

1201
00:40:15,490 --> 00:40:17,200
me a lot but i think i'll

1202
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:18,460
stretch yeah

1203
00:40:19,930 --> 00:40:21,370
wow people asked me how tall i

1204
00:40:21,370 --> 00:40:22,630
am a lot but i don't really

1205
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:24,850
think about it in general i just

1206
00:40:24,850 --> 00:40:26,470
think of people as either being my

1207
00:40:26,470 --> 00:40:28,630
height or tog i think most people

1208
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:30,070
as being i don't think about their

1209
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:31,240
height at all but if they're taller

1210
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:32,260
than me i'm aware of it that's

1211
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:33,520
it i was talking about this the

1212
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,170
other day on a on a show

1213
00:40:35,170 --> 00:40:37,030
that we did with neil patrick harris

1214
00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:39,550
where yeah it's being tall

1215
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:43,240
um you you never noticed anyone tight

1216
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:45,130
yeah so taller you just see people

1217
00:40:45,130 --> 00:40:46,780
and then when someone says like oh

1218
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:49,390
i'm short i usually go oh you

1219
00:40:49,390 --> 00:40:50,860
are oh yeah i guess so i

1220
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:53,140
mean i see everyone's tiny little short

1221
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:55,570
v yeah oh love to take your

1222
00:40:55,570 --> 00:40:59,650
word for it yeah ooh short

1223
00:41:01,270 --> 00:41:02,950
but i saw a woman one of

1224
00:41:02,950 --> 00:41:05,980
my yea today who is taller than

1225
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:07,630
me and i was like weirdly like

1226
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:09,220
jealous of it but i did i

1227
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:10,720
don't really want to be over six

1228
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:11,920
feet tall think that would cause lot

1229
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,600
more whose womb and problems with buying

1230
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:15,250
clothes and just make i feel like

1231
00:41:15,250 --> 00:41:17,470
fronting for acting it's terrible it would

1232
00:41:17,470 --> 00:41:18,670
be hard because it's already hard enough

1233
00:41:18,670 --> 00:41:19,990
i think being my height yeah it's

1234
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:21,970
terrible for me yeah it's it's right

1235
00:41:21,970 --> 00:41:23,950
yeah i doing bang bang it's like

1236
00:41:23,950 --> 00:41:26,140
trying to frame people in the shot

1237
00:41:26,290 --> 00:41:27,820
while trying to get someone's love interest

1238
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:30,040
if you're five ten because guys every

1239
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:32,050
actor is my short yeah and so

1240
00:41:32,050 --> 00:41:33,610
it's like you have i mean that's

1241
00:41:33,610 --> 00:41:35,140
it's a challenge yeah i think i've

1242
00:41:35,170 --> 00:41:36,610
i think i've for sure lost out

1243
00:41:36,610 --> 00:41:37,960
on things for being too tall yeah

1244
00:41:37,990 --> 00:41:39,100

this is a segment where here's a

1268
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:51,040
little story i like to tell about

1269
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:52,870
three bed brothers you know so well

1270
00:42:53,050 --> 00:42:58,480
you must describe a famous scene from

1271
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:02,590
a famous movie but describe it in

1272
00:43:02,590 --> 00:43:05,590
a way that is hard to guess

1273
00:43:05,710 --> 00:43:07,900
what the scene is what the movie

1274
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:12,850
is okay okay okay okay ah very

1275
00:43:12,850 --> 00:43:16,360
good very good awesome very good okay

1276
00:43:17,350 --> 00:43:19,810
um ah okay i'm thinking

okay i'll probably do this poorly okay

1278
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:29,290
and do do we get points if

1279
00:43:29,290 --> 00:43:30,850
we guess or there's not points it's

1280
00:43:30,850 --> 00:43:32,500
just a thing that we're doing it's

1281
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:33,610
just a thing that we're doing okay

1282
00:43:33,610 --> 00:43:33,940
got it

1283
