she thinks people are getting hurt and

189
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:40,680
and she said the worst one is

190
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:43,050
that one where they get shocked i

191
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:43,890
don't know if you've seen it but

192
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:45,600
there i've never seen it does feels

193
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,680
like something i should have seen all

194
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:49,170
of it's grain so but but but

195
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:50,640
there's one hole where if you miss

196
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,740
the whole you get shocked tell me

197
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,000
a bit and they have these it's

198
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:54,930
like it's

199
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,450
like a doctor frankenstein kind of setup

200
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:59,550
where they have like electrical switches and

201
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:01,650
then they have people with putters who

202
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:04,380
are supposedly conducting the current and they

203
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:06,870
put in this fake electricity current effect

204
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:08,513
so it's not really hurting anyone so

205
00:07:08,681 --> 00:07:10,140
it's like a mild shock it's like

206
00:07:10,162 --> 00:07:13,020
going operation yeah but my mom is

207
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:15,120

now

409
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:27,810
we have this apartment where um it

410
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:29,160
was it was like somebody had flipped

411
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,780
it you know so there was like

412
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:31,770
a lot of stuff that was a

413
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:34,020
little shoddy about it yeah um which

414
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:35,306
we didn't discover till after we'd lived

415
00:14:35,306 --> 00:14:36,630
there for a while yeah that's the

416
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:37,890
worst thing about that kind of yeah

417
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,510
no because you're at first like great

418
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:40,680
and then the longer you're there like

419
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:43,020
this every little thing yeah horrible yeah

420
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:44,250
which places it's like living on a

421
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,060
sept oh yeah

422
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:47,132

so oh yeah phone it and like

424
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:50,010
that yeah i think that's like one

425
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:51,600
of the i think that's such a

426
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:53,340
cheap gross way to try to make

427
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:55,080
money because you're doing the worst job

428
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,700
like you are you are you do

429
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,113
it really well and flip it and

430
00:14:58,113 --> 00:14:59,400
flipping well is one thing i'm saying

431
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:01,170
picking out all the worst shit is

432
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:02,280
a mad even if they do it

433
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,350
good all that cheap stuff like it's

434
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:05,220
yeah it's just there's no

435
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:05,880
no point you have to do it

436
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:07,230
again yeah well the one thing that

437
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:10,980
really splurged on where these tubs that

438
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:14,790
had this really wide wall you know

439
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,080
i don't know what else to call

440
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,255
it like the tub wall you know

441
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,870
like like the white heart of the

442
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:21,270
tub is yuk yeah like like if

657
00:22:29,615 --> 00:22:31,355
to have your phone because your germs

660
00:22:33,875 --> 00:22:37,115
whoa spray possible germs

661
00:22:38,285 --> 00:22:40,385
something has been really good a real

662
00:22:40,385 --> 00:22:41,675
it was a really good experience was

663
00:22:41,675 --> 00:22:42,935
we were watching this and i'd probably

664
00:22:42,935 --> 00:22:44,105
told you guys about the show the

665
00:22:44,105 --> 00:22:46,865
bureau the french show yeah sounds french

666
00:22:46,925 --> 00:22:50,975
it's liberal in america told the dresser

667
00:22:51,005 --> 00:22:54,515
it's in subtitles it has subtitles so

668
00:22:54,515 --> 00:22:56,225
you couldn't use your phone you had

669
00:22:56,225 --> 00:22:58,175
to just watch the show yeah and

670
00:22:58,265 --> 00:22:59,915
it was like a weird adjustment at

671
00:22:59,915 --> 00:23:01,835
first of like oh normally i'd be

672
00:23:02,075 --> 00:23:04,085
doing this so many times sometimes like

673
00:23:04,145 --> 00:23:06,425
oh yeah it was great and we

674
00:23:06,425 --> 00:23:07,955
really we love the show like we've

675
00:23:07,955 --> 00:23:09,605
got really invested in it you have

676
00:23:09,605 --> 00:23:10,655
to really be in the mood to

677
00:23:10,655 --> 00:23:11,855
be like i'm gonna put my phone

678
00:23:12,125 --> 00:23:13,265
then you get invested because you care

679
00:23:13,265 --> 00:23:14,885
about the plot yes but yeah it's

680
00:23:14,885 --> 00:23:16,805
so hard yeah i'll be watching shows

681
00:23:17,075 --> 00:23:18,395
and then go okay i have lit

682
00:23:18,395 --> 00:23:19,865
literally no idea what oh yeah yeah

683
00:23:19,865 --> 00:23:21,665
yeah i've seen that five times by

684
00:23:21,695 --> 00:23:23,855
going to a movie theater is sometimes

685
00:23:23,855 --> 00:23:25,595
really good because you can't take your

686
00:23:25,595 --> 00:23:27,905
phone out because yeah it's rude so

687
00:23:27,905 --> 00:23:29,435
it makes you you know watch the

688
00:23:29,435 --> 00:23:30,659
thing whereas if you just watch something

689
00:23:30,665 --> 00:23:31,925
at home like we watch milan or

690
00:23:31,925 --> 00:23:34,445
whatever recently you can just constantly be

691
00:23:34,445 --> 00:23:36,515

696
00:23:45,515 --> 00:23:46,625
for like part of it i watched

697
00:23:46,655 --> 00:23:48,485
trolls world tour and it was fucking

698
00:23:48,485 --> 00:23:50,045

699
00:23:50,045 --> 00:23:51,905
that you're watching trolls oh my god

700
00:23:51,905 --> 00:23:53,106
i thought it was the best i

701
00:23:53,106 --> 00:23:55,625
was good i loved it alright i

702
00:23:55,865 --> 00:23:57,545
got my phone halfway through but the

703
00:23:57,545 --> 00:23:58,385
first half

704
00:23:58,745 --> 00:24:01,475
i was like truly like a child

705
00:24:01,475 --> 00:24:05,285
like so we'd have secondary problems maybe

706
00:24:05,615 --> 00:24:07,925
but it was very funny and very

707
00:24:07,925 --> 00:24:10,145
beautiful too who's very funny it looks

708
00:24:10,145 --> 00:24:12,755
like the animation does look animation tantalizing

709
00:24:12,755 --> 00:24:14,945
and there's so much funny physical comedy

710
00:24:14,945 --> 00:24:15,905
with the characters

711
00:24:17,135 --> 00:24:20,165
what if trolls was real did toyota

712
00:24:20,465 --> 00:24:21,605

713
00:24:21,605 --> 00:24:23,435
i was it was really good shows

714
00:24:23,525 --> 00:24:26,165
is easy losers read when you watch

715
00:24:26,165 --> 00:24:28,295
the animation of trolls there's moments where

716
00:24:28,295 --> 00:24:31,325
they have muppet like fur hands when

717
00:24:31,325 --> 00:24:32,885
they're super close up on them yeah

718
00:24:32,885 --> 00:24:34,175
and it looks so cool

719
00:24:34,925 --> 00:24:36,185
the i wish i could be that

720
00:24:36,185 --> 00:24:38,165
close to a troll look man you'd

721
00:24:38,195 --> 00:24:39,425
probably argue it even know they're they're

722
00:24:39,425 --> 00:24:41,975

like ah ah of nice like are

743
00:25:33,965 --> 00:25:36,035
cool aren't call you know i was

744
00:25:36,035 --> 00:25:36,329
thinking

745
00:25:38,795 --> 00:25:40,655
peeked out on the balcony like eva

746
00:25:40,655 --> 00:25:43,505
peron over here looking really no chow

747
00:25:44,165 --> 00:25:46,295
but like nice dark wood navy white

748
00:25:46,295 --> 00:25:50,285
trim kind of real um cabernet feeling

749
00:25:50,465 --> 00:25:53,314
inside interest in every room yeah yeah

750
00:25:53,357 --> 00:25:55,745
yeah interesting sort of like a beach

751
00:25:55,745 --> 00:25:57,695
house as well yes like taking a

752
00:25:57,695 --> 00:25:59,525
beach house aesthetic but then we made

753
00:25:59,525 --> 00:26:00,784
like it on the beat almost like

754
00:26:01,025 --> 00:26:03,275
wow that dream that's the dream yeah

755
00:26:03,425 --> 00:26:04,115
that will never come

756
00:26:04,475 --> 00:26:06,335
so if here's here's a question if

757
00:26:06,335 --> 00:26:07,925
you had a beach house and a

758
00:26:07,925 --> 00:26:10,835
regular house yeah would you keep the

759
00:26:10,835 --> 00:26:13,085
beach house in that theme and have

760
00:26:13,085 --> 00:26:15,365
the regular house that you stayed during

761
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:19,415
the week in in more modern ah

762
00:26:19,445 --> 00:26:20,615
type thing or do you want both

763
00:26:20,615 --> 00:26:22,175
houses to feel the same no i

764
00:26:22,205 --> 00:26:23,315
think i would have the beach house

765
00:26:23,315 --> 00:26:24,395
be just like regular house

766
00:26:24,395 --> 00:26:26,315
house because also there were these houses

767
00:26:26,315 --> 00:26:27,755
a regular thing and then your regular

768
00:26:27,755 --> 00:26:29,915
houses like yes i wouldn't be fun

769
00:26:29,915 --> 00:26:31,385
like oh you're in a survey channel

770
00:26:31,385 --> 00:26:33,755
so you owe me at the beach

771
00:26:34,145 --> 00:26:35,615
i love the beach i love the

772
00:26:35,615 --> 00:26:37,565

779
00:26:53,165 --> 00:26:55,265
assembly from my friend michael who's a

780
00:26:55,325 --> 00:26:57,755
museum musician and composer bolton um

bookcase door am i getting bay didn't

793
00:27:29,735 --> 00:27:31,475

they did have a bookcase in um

795
00:27:33,935 --> 00:27:35,135
and franks was it a book but

796
00:27:35,135 --> 00:27:36,425
they were in the attic but yeah

797
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:38,615
i went to the house but i

798
00:27:38,615 --> 00:27:39,185
was really just

799
00:27:39,305 --> 00:27:39,635
that

800
00:27:40,715 --> 00:27:43,212
she was out um but i you

801
00:27:43,355 --> 00:27:44,105
see an

802
00:27:45,275 --> 00:27:47,975
really jet-lagged at anne frank so i

803
00:27:47,975 --> 00:27:50,105
was because i only had two days

804
00:27:50,105 --> 00:27:51,305
in amsterdam and i was like i

805
00:27:51,305 --> 00:27:52,865
gotta go there and i got to

806
00:27:52,889 --> 00:27:55,685
fuck a hooker gotta get up smoke

807
00:27:55,685 --> 00:27:57,155
all my hash was just a very

808
00:27:57,155 --> 00:27:58,475
importantly when to do it i wanna

809
00:27:58,485 --> 00:27:59,315
do it right away and i but

810
00:27:59,315 --> 00:28:00,245
i was really tired so i don't

811
00:28:00,245 --> 00:28:01,265
know that i remember exactly but i

812
00:28:01,325 --> 00:28:03,605
kind of follow very steep ladder by

813
00:28:03,605 --> 00:28:05,165
a bookcase but i think it was

814
00:28:05,165 --> 00:28:05,435
hidden

815
00:28:05,495 --> 00:28:07,175
i don't think there's a buy on

816
00:28:07,175 --> 00:28:09,155
the scene imus because all the books

817
00:28:09,155 --> 00:28:10,865
would fall just let me not want

818
00:28:10,865 --> 00:28:13,235
to see ledge this doesn't seem to

819
00:28:13,235 --> 00:28:15,515
be able to alien hiding the latter

820
00:28:15,515 --> 00:28:16,625
i think but let me just look

821
00:28:16,625 --> 00:28:22,445
ah okay oh okay oh guy remember

822
00:28:22,445 --> 00:28:24,035
him i do remember he was on

823
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:25,505
my television yes

824
00:28:25,595 --> 00:28:27,034
it was a bookcase doors right a

825
00:28:27,034 --> 00:28:29,522
secret door there was a secret oh

826
00:28:29,525 --> 00:28:32,585
well these other word yeah yeah that's

827
00:28:32,585 --> 00:28:32,735
right

828
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:35,929
so the original bookcase that can see

829
00:28:35,975 --> 00:28:38,375
the entrance to the hiding place anywhere

830
00:28:38,405 --> 00:28:39,845
and very funny excuse me has been

831
00:28:39,845 --> 00:28:40,745
a part of the anne frank house

832
00:28:40,745 --> 00:28:43,625
since it's opening nineteen okay cares however

833
00:28:43,625 --> 00:28:45,095
the condition of the bookcase has visibly

834
00:28:45,095 --> 00:28:46,685
deteriorated today the bookcase has a partial

835
00:28:46,685 --> 00:28:50,525
glass cover to prevent further damage ah

836
00:28:50,525 --> 00:28:52,295
good good i guess that's the way

837
00:28:52,295 --> 00:28:53,915
to do it that's though

838
00:28:53,915 --> 00:28:56,285
way to doe money for nothing and

839
00:28:56,285 --> 00:28:58,205
your chicks for free oh i just

840
00:28:58,205 --> 00:29:00,125
think this is interesting the original bookcase

841
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:01,955
visitors enter the secret annex through the

842
00:29:01,955 --> 00:29:04,295
narrow opening past the movable bookcase too

843
00:29:04,295 --> 00:29:05,954
many people visiting the anne frank house

844
00:29:05,954 --> 00:29:07,565
has emotional experience they try to imagine

845
00:29:07,565 --> 00:29:08,855
what it must have been like accepted

846
00:29:08,855 --> 00:29:11,675
for lawyers some people don't flashy ride

847
00:29:11,675 --> 00:29:12,395
you fuckers

848
00:29:13,655 --> 00:29:15,155
anyway whatever anyway

849
00:29:16,055 --> 00:29:17,405
okay move on i'm talking about amphora

850
00:29:17,409 --> 00:29:20,225
anyway whatever anne frank house um where

851
00:29:20,255 --> 00:29:21,665
where would you want your secret passageway

852
00:29:21,695 --> 00:29:23,945
to be for an office library or

853
00:29:23,945 --> 00:29:25,685
four i think someone that was to

854
00:29:25,685 --> 00:29:28,595
like a clause that's right there was

855
00:29:28,595 --> 00:29:30,755
this closet there was a shine that

856
00:29:30,755 --> 00:29:33,425
phone look no no i surely know

857
00:29:33,485 --> 00:29:35,675
in the in the closet in the

858
00:29:35,675 --> 00:29:35,915
walk

859
00:29:35,945 --> 00:29:37,445
in closet there was also a secret

860
00:29:37,445 --> 00:29:39,755
passageway that's how we do that took

861
00:29:39,755 --> 00:29:41,885
you to like the kitchen or something

862
00:29:41,915 --> 00:29:43,175
i knew i'm someone who had a

863
00:29:43,175 --> 00:29:45,185
panic room hidden in like a clause

864
00:29:45,253 --> 00:29:49,715
oh that wasn't tony foster no um

865
00:29:49,715 --> 00:29:51,725
but that's it i am scared of

866
00:29:51,725 --> 00:29:53,615
the idea of having a panic room

867
00:29:53,645 --> 00:29:55,655
because then by penny yeah it kind

868
00:29:55,655 --> 00:29:56,075
of makes you think

869
00:29:56,105 --> 00:29:56,735
i might have to go in there

870
00:29:56,735 --> 00:29:58,085
at some point all the time we

871
00:29:58,085 --> 00:30:00,305

because it's by my bed and i'm

874
00:30:03,755 --> 00:30:04,805
in charge of it but i still

875
00:30:04,805 --> 00:30:06,305

were

908
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:17,410
standing there like ten fifteen feet apart

909
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:19,630
and you guys are keeping ten fifteen

910
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,310

clear sure and there the floor was

912
00:31:23,410 --> 00:31:25,120
rumbling with all due to the ground

913
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,640
for typical earthquake stuff but i mean

914
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:30,550
it felt like so confusing to your

915
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:32,530
brain i have no one had asked

916
00:31:32,530 --> 00:31:34,120
you to get ready to run crown

00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:36,040
i don't work this way i haven't

918
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:39,340

a couple of the ones really but

921
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:45,250
so then the everything above his head

922
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:46,480
was like shaking and it was like

923
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,950
that realization as you're like looking at

924
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:50,530

is i think the hard thing yeah

1018
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:03,580
i mean yes i do think you

00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:04,780

1020
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:06,040
i'm gonna sleep over here especially a

1021
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,330
lot because if you have an earlier

1023
00:35:08,770 --> 00:35:09,610

get up in the dark or something

1025
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:11,110

it's just like the sound of storing

1045
00:35:55,990 --> 00:35:58,720
but it's like off the charts yeah

1046
00:35:58,870 --> 00:36:00,970
and i would go through this thing

1047
00:36:01,570 --> 00:36:03,520
every night where i would i would

1048
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:04,930

00:36:04,930 --> 00:36:07,870

1053
00:36:14,371 --> 00:36:16,360
i would say turn on your side

1054
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:18,280

common and prove a point it's not

1064
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,460
a common thing but i thought it

1065
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:47,200
was so funny how loud it was

1066
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,150
for whatever reason it was happening i

1067
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:50,770
was like okay i gotta take the

1068
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:51,370
distance right

1069
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:54,940

1122
00:38:31,870 --> 00:38:33,400

but bilal bilal baja you know like

1126
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:45,760
this thing which i haven't gotten into

1127
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,380
yet but it's like you could set

1128
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:48,978
your light in a sets like a

1129
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,800
routine for you so you'll be like

1130
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:53,020
thirty minutes of reading light and the

1131
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:53,560
light will fade

1132
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:54,820
fade and the sound will come out

1133
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:57,340
of your rain oh i like this

1134
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:00,580
that's so down for bed yeah the

1135
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:01,929
one thing i'm finding tricky about it

1136
00:39:01,929 --> 00:39:03,730
is i have the habit now of

1137
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,140
having my phone in the kitchen at

1138
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:06,843
night so i don't look back yes

1139
00:39:06,843 --> 00:39:09,370

things on the hatch from my phone

1141
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:13,720

1143
00:39:15,250 --> 00:39:17,260

you really think i loved it but

1147

i think it would be such a

1148
00:39:24,130 --> 00:39:25,330
waste of time i think it would

1149
00:39:25,330 --> 00:39:27,340
be really it's so long but i

1150
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:28,780
