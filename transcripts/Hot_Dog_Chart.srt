one jewish family in my neighborhood um

100
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:48,870
everybody was either catholic or protestant um

101
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:50,460

102
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:51,870

why are you trying to watch that

188
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:52,230
and i was like i just think

189
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:53,878
it might be interesting and then he

190
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:54,804
just kinda like

191
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:57,900
of course it would be just like

192
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,640
really not interested in it but i

193
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,990
will say i think there's an actual

194
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:02,730
documentary about sesame street that probably is

195
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:04,800
way more interesting it wasn't that interesting

196
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,880
i think he was kind of right

197
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,950
because it was kind of just predicting

198
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:09,900
the future he was just not interested

199
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,280
in it while it was happening i

200
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,930
think both he didn't actually see any

201
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:14,400
moment of it but i oh well

202
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,660
when the commercial came on for it

203
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:16,080
i was like i got

204
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,100
to record that i got to see

205
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,840
that and then he's like why and

206
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:19,620
i was like i don't know i

207
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:21,120
want to see that and i don't

208
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:21,480
know

209
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:24,600
but it's just some story now i

210
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,500
know there was something i was gonna

211
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,990
say oh i'm sorry it's a strange

212
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:29,460
thing to question it it's been on

213
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:32,370
for fifty years it was four it

214
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:34,950
was such a groundbreaking more missional thing

215
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:36,600
in our child and every like how

216
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,670
many generations of children like why is

217
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:40,200
that interesting why would you want to

218
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,250
do something like this

219
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,390
so there's a perk though that i

220
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:47,670
thought was really interesting that they had

221
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:50,970
um there was a a he scene

222
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,650
that was cut from sesame street where

223
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:54,000
they had spent a lot of money

224
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,320
on this episode and trying to make

225
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,430
this happen and and had a lot

226
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:58,920
of specialists come in to discuss this

227
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,330
topic and i was all about divorce

228
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,370
and it was snuffling up i guess

229
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:05,370
his little sister finally get divorced from

230
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:08,160
big bird yeah there and then i'm

231
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:10,410
snubbing his dad who's like with a

232
00:08:10,421 --> 00:08:12,030
big scuffle up a guest wearing a

233
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:15,090
tie and sunglasses or something glasses and

234
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:16,530
he's like what to see it he

235
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:18,870
takes the kids to their house and

236
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,430
like we're home and then they're like

237
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:21,900
let's go inside and he's thinking they

238
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:22,230
don't know

239
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:25,020
i don't live here anymore

240
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,560
all the worst way to break a

241
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,270
divorce though so don't you are there

242
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:31,680
any new he's like don't you remember

243
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:34,230
i don't live here anymore oh and

244
00:08:34,230 --> 00:08:36,120
then they said that the kids they

245
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,260
tested it on some kids and they

246
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:39,930
were all so confused and sad watching

247
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:41,670
it it's simply the way you're saying

248
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:43,620
it sounds confusing except for one kid

249
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:45,840
who was like well they didn't show

250
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,190
the whole thing with like how it

251
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:49,620
was explained fully but it seems like

252
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:51,120
there's a better way to deal with

253
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,000
the topic of divorce than that particular

254
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,950
execution of like hey kids your home

255
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:59,622
well no i don't think there as

256
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:01,170
well i think there was more to

257
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:02,296
it it was more to it come

258
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:03,810
and i also think that it was

259
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:05,370
relatable because it's like if you're a

260
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:07,140
little kid getting dropped off between homes

261
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:08,580
like it's probably confusing and then you

262
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:10,680
have this little girl's like being reminded

263
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:11,970
like no i don't i don't go

264
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:12,810
inside there anymore

265
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:15,570
and then these kids were so hurt

266
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:18,240
by this this video that they showed

267
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,980
that they didn't air it but then

268
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:21,450
the people making it were really upset

269
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:22,590
because they had put in so much

270
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:24,120
time and effort not pleased eric please

271
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,250
air and they send know who who

272
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:29,970
allows upset the the grips or the

273
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,670
puppet tear the the muppets ears

274
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,490
oh the third they're still called puppeteers

275
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:37,080
i believe i feel like they're called

276
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:37,950
something special

277
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:39,960
ah well

278
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:46,287
paul rolled his eyes really hard slow

279
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:48,210
burrard i'm sure you heard it it

280
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:52,530
was like ah sound but i just

281
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:53,730

boo boo hoo hoo hoo this talking

308
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:52,895
about sesame street though leads me to

309
00:10:52,895 --> 00:10:54,605
an interesting topic which we have not

310
00:10:54,605 --> 00:10:56,645
discussed fingers crossed on this show

311
00:10:58,085 --> 00:10:59,945
is this one of your topics this

312
00:10:59,945 --> 00:11:02,525
well i think it should be part

313
00:11:02,525 --> 00:11:04,775
of lawrence not scott ackerman streets on

314
00:11:04,775 --> 00:11:07,475
parade know you just name every street

315
00:11:07,475 --> 00:11:09,395
you've ever been on come on do

316
00:11:09,395 --> 00:11:12,875
it okay there's lexington that's where you

317
00:11:12,875 --> 00:11:13,565
start

318
00:11:14,645 --> 00:11:15,695
it was where i went to junior

319
00:11:15,695 --> 00:11:18,095
high oh my guy

320
00:11:20,195 --> 00:11:22,415

321
00:11:22,415 --> 00:11:24,785
well i have to help helping she's

322
00:11:24,815 --> 00:11:26,375
never talked about it on this show

323
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:27,875
and i thought that we maybe we

324
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:29,585
should talk about okay we can address

325
00:11:29,585 --> 00:11:31,415
it finally once and for all well

326
00:11:31,895 --> 00:11:36,365
look um look look here's the deal

327
00:11:36,425 --> 00:11:37,507
we may have to cut this because

328
00:11:37,507 --> 00:11:38,975
it's too traumatic for kids

329
00:11:40,655 --> 00:11:43,295
um i'm very happy because i'm pregnant

330
00:11:43,475 --> 00:11:51,155
yay from the device oh threesome baby

331
00:11:51,185 --> 00:11:53,315
no ah the father

332
00:11:54,845 --> 00:11:56,345
but if for anyone out there who

333
00:11:56,345 --> 00:11:57,725
is wondering why we're on zoom that's

334
00:11:57,725 --> 00:11:59,585
a huge part of it so yes

335
00:11:59,645 --> 00:12:01,655
yeah gotcha

336
00:12:01,865 --> 00:12:05,675
transition to zoom because first of all

337
00:12:06,065 --> 00:12:07,955
you we can only do one episode

338
00:12:07,955 --> 00:12:09,575
at a time and setting up the

339
00:12:10,445 --> 00:12:11,795
oh yeah when we're doing two episodes

340
00:12:11,795 --> 00:12:13,475
at a time outside and then i

341
00:12:13,475 --> 00:12:15,575
found that after both times doing that

342
00:12:15,575 --> 00:12:17,345
i was extremely exhausted i had a

343
00:12:17,345 --> 00:12:18,395
headache all night long

344
00:12:19,235 --> 00:12:23,089
oh nine long hey k

345
00:12:24,245 --> 00:12:25,775
um so i requested that we moved

346
00:12:25,775 --> 00:12:27,095
to zoom and you know it's just

347
00:12:27,095 --> 00:12:28,895
been so great for me ever since

348
00:12:30,725 --> 00:12:33,095
so i was outvoted i said i

349
00:12:33,095 --> 00:12:35,345
don't care i'm not pregnant so why

350
00:12:35,345 --> 00:12:37,415
should i have to do zoom um

351
00:12:37,535 --> 00:12:40,445
but low scots outvoted me so we

352
00:12:40,445 --> 00:12:42,005
are a democracy i know i voted

353
00:12:42,005 --> 00:12:44,465
that you should get pregnant yes and

354
00:12:44,465 --> 00:12:47,615
i'm trying so try i'm trying yeah

355
00:12:47,615 --> 00:12:49,295
i'm been injecting myself with so many

356
00:12:49,295 --> 00:12:49,865

than the public yes and we've danced

360
00:12:59,435 --> 00:13:01,745

been trying to guess it for a

398
00:14:20,315 --> 00:14:21,875
while which i had to just like

399
00:14:21,935 --> 00:14:23,525
i will never say it so we

400
00:14:23,525 --> 00:14:26,135
have to stop this but um she

401
00:14:26,135 --> 00:14:27,725
had a lot of interesting guesses to

402
00:14:27,725 --> 00:14:29,525
throw out there what was the worst

403
00:14:29,525 --> 00:14:29,915
one

404
00:14:31,205 --> 00:14:32,915
they weren't really weird they just weren't

405
00:14:32,915 --> 00:14:34,985
really names that i would probably pick

406
00:14:34,985 --> 00:14:36,575
like she said like danielle and i

407
00:14:36,575 --> 00:14:40,085
was like no man yell like daniel's

408
00:14:40,085 --> 00:14:41,855
a fine name i'm just like doesn't

409
00:14:41,855 --> 00:14:43,403
that seem random for me to maybe

410
00:14:43,475 --> 00:14:46,745
die now i don't know um i

411
00:14:46,803 --> 00:14:48,965
was just a random she was coming

412
00:14:48,965 --> 00:14:51,305
at me with like bella ella daddy

413
00:14:51,305 --> 00:14:56,105
yeah la bella gela kela lulla

414
00:14:57,995 --> 00:15:00,005
until something sounds right but we have

415
00:15:00,005 --> 00:15:01,175
said it accidentally in front of a

416
00:15:01,175 --> 00:15:02,345
couple of people and then they didn't

417
00:15:02,345 --> 00:15:05,555
hear it was ah the perfect rye

418
00:15:05,555 --> 00:15:07,265
i know my friend was over helping

419
00:15:07,265 --> 00:15:09,185
us move some furniture

420
00:15:10,415 --> 00:15:13,685
ooh oh you oh my friend bill

421
00:15:13,745 --> 00:15:17,405
william bill for sure yeah um and

422
00:15:17,525 --> 00:15:19,115
that we said put it in sounds

423
00:15:19,145 --> 00:15:20,075
you know we said the name i

424
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:21,155
put it in so it says room

425
00:15:21,155 --> 00:15:22,895
and then aw a minute later he

426
00:15:22,895 --> 00:15:24,755
goes we did you just say it

427
00:15:24,815 --> 00:15:26,135
and we're like yeah and he was

428
00:15:26,135 --> 00:15:27,695
like oh my god i didn't hear

429
00:15:27,695 --> 00:15:30,425
when it was ah

430
00:15:30,455 --> 00:15:31,985
and then like due to the d

431
00:15:31,985 --> 00:15:33,005
set in front of someone i was

432
00:15:33,005 --> 00:15:35,045
like you gotta watch that tongue

433
00:15:36,815 --> 00:15:39,995
secret but that means that means you

434
00:15:39,995 --> 00:15:42,335
guys are saying it yourselves to your

435
00:15:42,365 --> 00:15:44,315
to each other so much yeah it's

436
00:15:44,315 --> 00:15:45,995
like it's just second nature to say

437
00:15:45,995 --> 00:15:47,645
as if she's already here it's becoming

438
00:15:47,675 --> 00:15:49,505
a casualty i feel like i use

439
00:15:49,505 --> 00:15:51,305
it like half the time but it's

440
00:15:51,305 --> 00:15:52,835
very vulnerable yeah

441
00:15:54,035 --> 00:15:55,085
also because i feel like you want

442
00:15:55,085 --> 00:15:56,225
to get used to the idea of

443
00:15:56,225 --> 00:15:57,635
the name make sure you like it

444
00:15:57,635 --> 00:15:58,685
when you say it out loud because

445
00:15:58,685 --> 00:16:01,775
it is such a commitment to name

446
00:16:01,775 --> 00:16:04,355
somebody do you have a backup name

447
00:16:04,385 --> 00:16:06,155
just just come down and you're like

448
00:16:06,155 --> 00:16:08,195
you don't look like a tonya slapping

449
00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:10,715
know i have no idea i have

450
00:16:10,715 --> 00:16:13,025
no other ideas so it's kind of

451
00:16:13,025 --> 00:16:14,075
this user can i

452
00:16:14,135 --> 00:16:17,675
ask is the name based on like

453
00:16:17,675 --> 00:16:19,325
you you thought the danielle was so

454
00:16:19,325 --> 00:16:20,915
random because why would you do it

455
00:16:20,945 --> 00:16:22,385
so it says to me that the

456
00:16:22,385 --> 00:16:25,145
name is based upon someone in your

457
00:16:25,145 --> 00:16:27,545
life previously well that's so interesting because

458
00:16:27,545 --> 00:16:29,555
it's actually not and so i think

459
00:16:29,555 --> 00:16:30,665
you're right that the name is about

460
00:16:30,665 --> 00:16:32,975
as random as danielle oh but

461
00:16:34,265 --> 00:16:35,855
like it might as well be any

462
00:16:35,855 --> 00:16:38,345
name but um it's not this the

463
00:16:38,345 --> 00:16:40,745
name is not um half not not

464
00:16:40,745 --> 00:16:43,415
something in your family not something there's

465
00:16:43,415 --> 00:16:45,875
a knot in the fertile name ah

466
00:16:45,875 --> 00:16:48,305
nah oh a middleman to and you

467
00:16:48,305 --> 00:16:49,895
say the first middle name old-time right

468
00:16:49,925 --> 00:16:51,875
no no no no no i say

469
00:16:52,055 --> 00:16:52,835
say her full name

470
00:16:54,635 --> 00:16:56,315
so this is great i had a

471
00:16:56,315 --> 00:16:58,655
question yeah been meaning to ask you

472
00:16:58,655 --> 00:17:01,895
about this yeah okay how much would

473
00:17:01,895 --> 00:17:04,565

00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:07,265
to act like big sue for the

475
00:17:07,265 --> 00:17:08,555

526
00:19:00,245 --> 00:19:01,805
you know very grateful to be in

00:19:01,805 --> 00:19:03,245
this position so i feel like that's

528
00:19:03,245 --> 00:19:05,645
playing a huge role in my response

529
00:19:05,645 --> 00:19:08,555
to any physical ailments that i have

530
00:19:08,555 --> 00:19:11,585

540
00:19:30,515 --> 00:19:32,255

00:19:59,915 --> 00:20:02,285
mom so it feels like something that

556
00:20:02,285 --> 00:20:03,995
i've just always wanted and i'm why

557
00:20:04,025 --> 00:20:06,275
why can i ask in ah and

558
00:20:06,275 --> 00:20:08,765
this is not just about you particularly

559
00:20:08,825 --> 00:20:10,055
if i mean i'm always interested when

560
00:20:10,055 --> 00:20:11,555
i hear like people have wanted to

561
00:20:11,555 --> 00:20:14,225
be mom since they were kids since

562
00:20:14,225 --> 00:20:16,235
they were little what is it about

563
00:20:16,235 --> 00:20:18,245
being a mom that when you're so

564
00:20:18,245 --> 00:20:18,905
young and

565
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,580
and what is it about being a

566
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:22,980
mom that's like appealing yeah it's interesting

567
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:24,540
because i feel like i you know

568
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:26,070
i think people will say like little

569
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:27,625
girls imagine their wedding and stuff i'd

570
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:29,790
never like thought about anything like that

571
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:31,380
and castle teams queen

572
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,950
like that never crossed my mind but

573
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:37,380
i always assumed i would get married

574
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:38,670
and assumed i would have a family

575
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:39,600
but i think so much of that

576
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,160
is based on like if you if

577
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,200
you grow up feeling that way it's

578
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,490
a lot to do with your family

579
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:46,560
life and your parents and like what

580
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:49,530
you see emulated you know before you

581
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:51,090
are what you want to emulate

582
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,990
and i'm so i feel like i

583
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:56,670
always kind of assumed that would all

584
00:20:56,670 --> 00:20:59,070
happen but in my head i feel

585
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:01,020
like being a mom just seems like

586
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:02,580
i always want to be a caretaker

587
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:04,920
and teach somebody and like have that

588
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:08,460
relationship and that's always been something that's

589
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:09,600
important to me i even i mean

590
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:10,770
it as being a little kid it's

591
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:12,300
like a sort of abstract idea

592
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:14,490
idea but like little babies like baby

593
00:21:14,490 --> 00:21:15,870
dolls you know it's too weird it's

594
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:17,550
like a neat it's very strange

595
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:20,100
yeah i don't cool up

596
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:22,980
she i don't think she wants to

597
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:24,030
be a mom because she had the

598
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:26,840
greatest relationship with her mom right she

599
00:21:26,889 --> 00:21:28,740
maybe that's chart how the inspiration to

600
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:29,850
she had to take care of her

601
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:32,220
sisters growing home when they were really

602
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:34,770
young so i think she always was

603
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:37,140
a caretaker when she was really young

604
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:38,070
you know what i mean so i

605
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:40,410
think so maybe that makes sense yeah

606
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:41,340
yeah i didn't

607
00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:42,720
have to take care of anyone but

608
00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:45,840
i what i wanted to when i

609
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,210
was younger i just assumed i would

610
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:49,920
have kids i was because i was

611
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:53,160
religious and i was just like the

612
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:55,980
natural order you know and it was

613
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:57,540
a long thank-you to have like eight

614
00:21:57,630 --> 00:21:58,620
the same way that

615
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:02,160
that your parents had a bone i

616
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:03,900
think i i think i thought i

617
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:06,210
would have i don't know that i

618
00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:07,920
ever fixed a number in my mind

619
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,270
i don't think i think when i

620
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:10,470
when i thought about it i didn't

621
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:12,150
imagine like a huge family like that

622
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:15,180
yeah um i think i just thought

623
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:16,830
like there would be a vague amount

624
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:19,320
of children that i would have you

625
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:19,980
know can i add

626
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:22,980
ask did that did did that coincide

627
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:24,150
with you wanting to be in show

628
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:26,640
business like or did it divert or

629
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:30,090
diverge when you suddenly start thinking about

630
00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:32,010
show business wasn't like oh maybe i

631
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:34,560
don't have the kids anymore or do

632
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,610
you know what i mean i yeah

633
00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:36,690
i do but i don't know that

634
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:38,820
i could i could i don't know

635
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:40,140
that i held both idee

636
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:41,550
ideas in my mind at the same

637
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:43,980
time you know you're a one guy

638
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:46,830
he's got to talk mind and one

639
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:48,480
at a time i do everyday and

640
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:51,000
comedy was the track he was ah

641
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:52,230
this is your bio pic

642
00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:55,290
a true hollywood story and then mike

643
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:56,880
is seeing a commercial saying why is

644
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,920
that why would anyone watch this um

645
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:01,980
i i think it was like i

646
00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:03,660
cause i when i was a kid

647
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:05,250
i of course i wanted to be

648
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,380
in show business but i don't that's

649
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:07,680
not

650
00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:11,790
when you don't know anybody who is

651
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:14,850
in show business it's not really real

652
00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:16,920
it always feels like a dream it

653
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,870
doesn't feel like a a goal you

654
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:20,520
know it just feels like that will

655
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,230
be great and as you like when

656
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:23,730
you're a little kid you you picture

657
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:25,710
yourself doing that but then as you

658
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:27,450
get older and you start thinking about

659
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:28,860
the concept of having a job

660
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:30,240
job and having to take care of

661
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:32,340
yourself and so on and so forth

662
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:35,970
i don't it was not a real

663
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:38,040
viable thing to me until i started

664
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,570
doing it until i started doing open

665
00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:41,929
mics yeah even that was like because

666
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,010
a friend invited me to do it

667
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,520
and i don't know if i ever

668
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,020
really would have thought about it as

669
00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:50,550
like oh that's that's a thing that

670
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:52,170
you can actually do for a living

671
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:52,830
yeah

672
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:56,340
so so so you were at what

673
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:59,490
point did you say oh i'm ah

674
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,220
the whole kid thing is not going

675
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:03,813
to be something i do without was

676
00:24:03,813 --> 00:24:05,130
that when you actually got married to

677
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:06,660
the particular person i don't want to

678
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:08,880
give away your name that you're married

679
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:12,090
to mrs tompkins um it's it's before

680
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:13,560
it was before like when we started

681
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:14,220
when we got sick

682
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:16,350
arius and then you you have to

683
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:18,810
say about series i was waiting oh

684
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:21,270
me how he could possibly know he

685
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:22,830
found the second thing didn't happen

686
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:27,180
what's o j j and you get

687
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:30,870
a serious j gene um that was

688
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:33,450
when i was when i was doing

689
00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:34,770
open mics there was a bar around

690
00:24:34,770 --> 00:24:37,140
the corner from our home club me

691
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:38,940
and my pals the fudge bar this

692
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:43,110
because it's around the corner

693
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:46,410
oh no

694
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:50,520
this place called molly's though he used

695
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:53,520
to go to um that had a

696
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:57,780
video jukebox oh cool that had maybe

697
00:24:58,050 --> 00:25:00,600
six songs and one of the songs

698
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:01,830
and this got the guy that used

699
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:03,870
to manage the club when he would

700
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:05,220
come hang out with us he would

701
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:07,200
always put that song on jane's getting

702
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:07,740
serious

703
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:10,710
as with the other five some guy

704
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:13,110
and there were guys in gorilla suits

705
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:15,690
at some point um and when the

706
00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:17,220
guys in the gorilla suits are come

707
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:18,930
on this guy that put the video

708
00:25:18,930 --> 00:25:21,270
on would say there's my boys and

709
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:22,860
then you would go there's my boy

710
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:25,380
yeah and so you'd see these gorillas

711
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:26,370

00:25:26,370 --> 00:25:27,090

00:26:36,390 --> 00:26:39,150
related to david cao stephen cassidy but

741
00:26:39,150 --> 00:26:40,500
i'm like but no one who cared

742
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,030
more who to hear more about you

743
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:46,018
know because everyone into sean cassidy was

744
00:26:46,018 --> 00:26:48,960
us big time absolutely then when they

745
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,270
both were i feel like david cassidy

746
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:51,390
was

747
00:26:51,432 --> 00:26:53,670
much bigger because the partridge family yeah

748
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:55,050
shaun was such a huge it was

749
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:56,790
because people did you run ron and

750
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:59,100
yeah number one hits and stuff okay

751
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:00,360
i sit corrected

752
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:04,350
on my fat ass

753
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:11,040
back to lawrence pregnancy about paul's journey

754
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:16,050
okay well that was dirty smollett i

755
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:19,800
really was like um it was a

756
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,810
difficult thing to figure out because you

757
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:24,000
feel like you're not allowed first of

758
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,140
all you feel like you're not allowed

759
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:25,740
to say

760
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:27,000
you don't want to have kids because

761
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,650
that i don't know that seems like

762
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:30,030
a monstrous thing to say to some

763
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:33,330
people um and will really don't especially

764
00:27:33,330 --> 00:27:34,200
i don't know if it's different for

765
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,360
men but i have some female friends

766
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:38,190
who don't want kids and people just

767
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:39,870
don't believe them they're like you'll change

768
00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:42,000
your mind i've heard that so many

769
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,950
times but what's funny is nobody says

770
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:45,900
that to us nobodies

771
00:27:45,964 --> 00:27:47,370
ever said that to like me

772
00:27:49,530 --> 00:27:51,180
but also we got married when we

773
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:54,150
got married we were i was forty

774
00:27:54,210 --> 00:27:56,760
i was forty one and janie was

775
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,710
um in her thirty in her late

776
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:01,770
thirties and so it wasn't always forty

777
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:05,070
one jamie's in early thirties

778
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:11,100
ah but it shows the painful paul

779
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:13,050
has to breathe through this whole entire

780
00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:14,400
early it was i feel like that's

781
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:17,100
easier to skirt past that question at

782
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:20,240
that point because yeah you're like yea

783
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,990
it's fine we don't we can we

784
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:23,070
can't we don't have to it's like

785
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:24,450
it doesn't have to be ah it's

786
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:25,470
not when you're like getting married at

787
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:26,460
twenty four and everyone's like so

788
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:28,290
oh yeah okay yes main course of

789
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:31,020
course but that's interesting and so did

790
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:32,430
janie i mean you don't have to

791
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:33,180
get into this if you don't want

792
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:35,010
to but did she know that already

793
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:36,570
about herself that she didn't want to

794
00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:38,610
do that no we kind of when

795
00:28:38,610 --> 00:28:41,218
we got together we were both we

796
00:28:41,218 --> 00:28:42,240
were both on the fence about it

797
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,620
we're both on the fence about it

798
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:45,900
but knowing that well if we're gonna

799
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:46,590
do this we'd have

800
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:48,570
to make a decision about it very

801
00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:51,300
soon you know um and then we

802
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:54,720
just never really we just never really

803
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,610
talked about it that much and every

804
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:57,420
once in a while it would come

805
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:58,650
up and it would be like do

806
00:28:58,650 --> 00:29:01,260
we want this where you know and

807
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:05,130
then we finally just likes came out

808
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:06,360
and said it like no this is

809
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:06,750
not a thing

810
00:29:06,816 --> 00:29:08,430
the same time to do yea to

811
00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:09,990
what yeah i don't think we want

812
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:10,260
to do

813
00:29:11,370 --> 00:29:12,900
um but i think there must be

814
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:15,240
some like real comfort in knowing that

815
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:18,030
well there is challenging that it's like

816
00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:20,640
the idea of just going like i

817
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,320
know that i don't want that it's

818
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,420
just but whichever decision you make you

819
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:26,490
always think about the other decision yeah

820
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:28,650
and you know for me it's like

821
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:31,320
for me it's like i really

822
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:33,690
i love kids i don't know how

823
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:35,280
good a dad i would be i

824
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:38,550
think that i disagree now i mean

825
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:40,260
who cares but you know because i

826
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:41,370
mean do what you wanna do in

827
00:29:41,370 --> 00:29:42,630
your life but i think you we

828
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:44,458
would be a great dad i think

829
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:46,470
i'd be very loving but i don't

830
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:48,450
need a good granddad i think i'd

831
00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:49,950
be a great-granddaughter can you just skip

832
00:29:49,985 --> 00:29:51,660
that i think well the way i

833
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:52,860
i feel now is like i have

834
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,210
i have these young friends and i

835
00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:56,160
like feeling like the father of adult

836
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:59,689
children yeah like i'm proud yeah oh

837
00:29:59,689 --> 00:30:01,080
yeah so that makes a lot of

838
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:03,990
sense yeah that's gonna work too oh

839
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:06,060
my god yeah they'd have to get

840
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:08,340
used to you yelling and cursing when

841
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:11,460
when like sitting down around the house

842
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:13,542
but there is something about that actually

843
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:15,870
just saw a twitter thread um yesterday

844
00:30:15,870 --> 00:30:18,960
from jack something new on twitter yeah

845
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,040
it was a newer way can we

846
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:20,490
pause

847
00:30:22,404 --> 00:30:24,380
no new tweets coming every few minutes

848
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:29,150
the computers um jack hay posted about

849
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:31,730
being i love her i'd love to

850
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:34,910
tweet on sister sister and she was

851
00:30:34,910 --> 00:30:37,340
like when i was initially you know

852
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:39,140
auditioning or offered the role or whatever

853
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:40,700
issues like i didn't see myself as

854
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:42,350
being a mother i was like two

855
00:30:42,410 --> 00:30:44,150
young and sexy to be somebody's mom

856
00:30:44,930 --> 00:30:46,010
so i don't wanna take the role

857
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,170
but then by taking the part i

858
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,180
understood i started to understand how amazing

859
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:52,700
it feels to mentor young girls and

860
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:54,710
to be somebody that can teach them

861
00:30:54,710 --> 00:30:55,910
and they can look up to them

862
00:30:55,910 --> 00:30:57,470
and i think that's so cool it's

863
00:30:57,470 --> 00:31:00,170
like it's a interesting relationship to have

864
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,340
to be able to be like someone's

865
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:02,570
older mentor and

866
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:03,710
and be able to be there for

867
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:05,720
them and like not everyone is successful

868
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,070
tv show and be a mentor to

869
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:09,950
someone yeah i mean it's amazing i

870
00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:11,300
just have to assume on comedy bang

871
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:12,590

00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:16,730
think anything's going to change and then

924
00:33:16,910 --> 00:33:17,240
the

925
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,100
day after he had the baby he

926
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:21,320
called me up and was like ah

927
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,270
okay so i gotta drop out of

928
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:25,790
that show ah this is like crazier

929
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:28,580
than i thought yeah literally had never

930
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:29,480
seen a baby

931
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,690
like how did they what and like

932
00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:34,340
i'm sure his wife or partner was

933
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:38,390
like you can't just leave me yeah

934
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:41,720
from that extreme of thinking oh nothing's

935
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:45,410
gonna change to like totally planning out

936
00:33:45,410 --> 00:33:46,430
what your life is going to be

937
00:33:46,430 --> 00:33:47,990
like where are you in the i

938
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:48,920
think i kind of fall in the

939
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,810
middle i'm very um i'm trying to

940
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:52,310
take everything really day by day which

941
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:54,500
i think i've done really successfully during

942
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:55,970
this time i turn out to get

943
00:33:55,970 --> 00:33:59,090
ahead of myself um but there's like

944
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,500
been certain points where i felt like

945
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:01,700
okay maybe i should get ahead of

946
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:03,560
myself a little bit like because you

947
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:05,960
know talking to other pregnant people i

948
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,700
feel like they would have more things

949
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:09,110
figured out that i did or something

950
00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:10,010
and i'm like oh i don't know

951
00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:10,940
any i don't know the answer

952
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,170
that question i guess i should look

953
00:34:12,170 --> 00:34:14,450
that up or these are previously pregnant

954
00:34:14,450 --> 00:34:16,430
people or no people who are currently

955
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:19,284
pregnant like where kirt briggs i was

956
00:34:19,284 --> 00:34:20,660
where there's a makeup artist that i

957
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:23,000
work with and she's pregnant and like

958
00:34:23,090 --> 00:34:24,830
ah on basically like a cup just

959
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:25,730
a couple of weeks ahead of me

960
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:29,900
and um we were working on something

961
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:31,130
together in this other way

962
00:34:31,130 --> 00:34:32,212
woman was like asking us like oh

963
00:34:32,212 --> 00:34:33,200
where are you going to deliver and

964
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:34,280
all this stuff and i was like

965
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:36,140
at the time i had no idea

966
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:38,090
so like there's moments like that where

967
00:34:38,090 --> 00:34:39,200
i feel like oh my day by

968
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:41,990
day um sense is maybe not great

969
00:34:41,990 --> 00:34:45,200
for like actually feeling less anxious like

970
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:46,610
i think sometimes it helps me feel

971
00:34:46,610 --> 00:34:48,890
anxious but then sometimes it's nice to

972
00:34:48,890 --> 00:34:49,940
have a plan so i'm getting to

973
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:51,260
the point now where i'm like

974
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:54,170
planning more for like the things that

975
00:34:54,170 --> 00:34:55,430
are more imminent but

976
00:34:56,810 --> 00:34:59,330
in terms of like my life changing

977
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:01,010
i'm just trying to take off from

978
00:35:01,010 --> 00:35:02,390
work like we're trying to we're trying

979
00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:03,890
to record these episodes in advance and

980
00:35:03,890 --> 00:35:06,380
i'm doing that with newcomers and anything

981
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:08,330
i can get done beforehand would be

982
00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:09,560
great so that i can just feel

983
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:11,150
like i can just be in the

984
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:14,840
moment and see what happens but i

985
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:15,860
don't know i don't have any plans

986
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:16,730
about like getting a nanny

987
00:35:16,730 --> 00:35:17,900
any are doing anything i don't know

988
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:18,920
i don't know what's going to happen

989
00:35:19,370 --> 00:35:20,360
it seems like a lot to figure

990
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:22,970
out paul's piss all left is upset

991
00:35:22,970 --> 00:35:23,956
because he thought he was going to

992
00:35:23,956 --> 00:35:24,500
be the nanny

993
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:30,440
ah close my door and also i

994
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:32,930
get scared of miami's because many mcphee

995
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:36,260
one oh she's ugly she's highly wrought

996
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:38,570
on the news forget about it oh

997
00:35:38,690 --> 00:35:41,030
she's the anti-money mary poppins that's right

998
00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:43,340
as we've discussed but i think i'm

999
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:44,990
getting into that mindset now like wanting

1000
00:35:44,990 --> 00:35:45,770
to have everything so

1001
00:35:45,770 --> 00:35:47,240
set and ready to go and that's

1002
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:49,220
feeling that's making me feel better and

1003
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:51,500
i started taking some online classes it's

1004
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:52,790
weird i mean it's like covert and

1005
00:35:52,790 --> 00:35:55,040
everything are some classes or class yeah

1006
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:57,290
labor class like labor and delivery and

1007
00:35:57,290 --> 00:35:59,210
then they also will cover labour and

1008
00:35:59,210 --> 00:36:01,490
the tories um yeah they're also going

1009
00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:04,880
to cover labour no thanks and whatnot

1010
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:05,870
like what to expect

1011
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:08,600
when when you're expecting exactly what i'm

1012
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,730
reading that i mean are you doing

1013
00:36:10,730 --> 00:36:13,040
like breathing like lamar's shit and all

1014
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,360
that of stuff i don't really i

1015
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:16,010
haven't gotten to that part of the

1016
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:19,130
videos yeah also the bill cosby ah

1017
00:36:19,490 --> 00:36:21,200
chunk on it about the you know

1018
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,010
it's been a while since i listen

1019
00:36:22,018 --> 00:36:23,750
to a bill cosby joke it's it's

1020
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:25,670
you gotta breathe

1021
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:28,250
middle of mars i think is kind

1022
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:29,870
of dated but i think there's still

1023
00:36:29,870 --> 00:36:32,570
breathing techniques that they use that now

1024
00:36:32,570 --> 00:36:34,940
looks le mans and it's faster yeah

1025
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:37,190
lamar's actually for men

1026
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:43,970
ah let's go bars lamar he's this

1027
00:36:43,970 --> 00:36:46,220

00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:48,800
you're here now

1030
00:36:48,890 --> 00:36:50,750
a brief first go

1031
00:36:51,770 --> 00:36:53,900
well there's all these things like hypnobirthing

1032
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:55,370
and what have you breathe is exactly

1033
00:36:55,370 --> 00:36:57,800
like that by the way ou all

1034
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,750
day i don't think just like by

1035
00:36:59,930 --> 00:37:02,390
just my regular breathing that sells all

1036
00:37:02,390 --> 00:37:04,640
day would anyone ever want to be

1037
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,590
around wait tell me about hip know

1038
00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:09,260
hypnobirthing i haven't fully explored it but

1039
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:10,790
i there's a friend of mine from

1040
00:37:10,790 --> 00:37:11,930
high school who i was reconnecting

1041
00:37:11,976 --> 00:37:13,220
with an instagram a little bit because

1042
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:14,810
she's also due around the same time

1043
00:37:14,810 --> 00:37:16,610
as me and she's had a baby

1044
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:17,780
before so she was just giving me

1045
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:20,240
a lot of tips and info and

1046
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,400
she was going on about hypnobirthing which

1047
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,530
i i need to really look into

1048
00:37:24,530 --> 00:37:25,310
but this is part of the thing

1049
00:37:25,310 --> 00:37:26,720
of my my taking a day by

1050
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:27,770
day as i'm like i don't really

1051
00:37:27,770 --> 00:37:28,850
want to look at all that right

1052
00:37:28,850 --> 00:37:30,020
now it feels kind of intense to

1053
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:31,130
like learn about all that right now

1054
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,090
but then i'm like i should

1055
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:33,470
learn about that but i think it's

1056
00:37:33,470 --> 00:37:35,990
about keeping your mentality really calm and

1057
00:37:35,990 --> 00:37:39,440
like um focused and not not getting

1058
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,940
anxious during the process and so it's

1059
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,670
techniques to keep yourself i would think

1060
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:44,810
that it would be like making you

1061
00:37:44,835 --> 00:37:46,730
think you're a chicken and then you

1062
00:37:46,730 --> 00:37:48,950
just you just learned you think you're

1063
00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:50,786
laying an egg yeah and it's easy

1064
00:37:50,786 --> 00:37:51,020
p

1065
00:37:53,472 --> 00:37:55,610
to think chicken labor is hard

1066
00:37:56,930 --> 00:37:57,170
i mean

1067
00:37:58,430 --> 00:38:00,080
yeah i don't know no i think

1068
00:38:00,170 --> 00:38:01,578
i think it's probably really easy so

1069
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:02,780
it's a question for the room they

1070
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:04,220
were worried about every day i don't

1071
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:06,170
think it's like of the table

1072
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:11,570
score they just kinda go you know

1073
00:38:11,570 --> 00:38:12,740
what i think is weird though is

1074
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:14,690
like the shell forming inside the body

1075
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:18,110
yeah but i mean that's another thing

1076
00:38:18,110 --> 00:38:20,450
about having a baby that's crazy it's

1077
00:38:20,450 --> 00:38:22,880
just how much i have there's no

1078
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,950
show you know i have a bunch

1079
00:38:24,950 --> 00:38:27,020
of apps that i follow every day

1080
00:38:27,050 --> 00:38:27,500

baby's brain is getting more wrinkles to

1085
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:39,530

00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:04,490
office at

1131
00:40:04,490 --> 00:40:05,600

1132
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:06,650
my face and lips like what are

1133
00:40:06,650 --> 00:40:09,080
you looking at it was like hotdogs

1134
00:40:10,790 --> 00:40:13,670
and she's like i'm rethinking everything ever

1135
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:15,560
whenever janey asks me what i'm looking

1136
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:16,880
at on my phone if i'm like

1137
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:19,550
smiling or laugh at something it's always

1138
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:22,010
she only ever asks when it is

1139
00:40:22,010 --> 00:40:24,590
something that requires so much backstory and

1140
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:26,960
explanation and i'm like i did thai

1141
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:29,810
guy gotcha oh my god yeah years

1142
00:40:29,810 --> 00:40:30,380
ago there was

1143
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,920
yeah that's a michael be like what

1144
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:33,850
are you looking like if i ever

1145
00:40:33,850 --> 00:40:34,893
have the sound on he's like what's

1146
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:36,580
that i'm like nobody it's nothing like

1147
00:40:36,850 --> 00:40:40,120
he's like nothing it's never good you

1148
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:42,160
internet who gives us you don't need

1149
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:44,380
to know but then i tell him

1150
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:45,280
and he's like i don't care that

1151
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,360
and so here we go you know

1152
00:40:46,390 --> 00:40:48,047
because first i think so it's always

1153

1154
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:51,160
makes noi

1155
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:53,140
noises because she wants me to ask

1156
00:40:53,650 --> 00:40:55,612
so it'll be yeah like totally

1157
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:59,140

1252
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:22,130
worst now what do you mean it's

1253
00:44:22,305 --> 00:44:24,878
just so our friends' parents come down

1254
00:44:25,035 --> 00:44:29,620
like hey no ah ah their parents

1255
00:44:29,620 --> 00:44:31,180
stayed a few doors down from me

1256
00:44:31,180 --> 00:44:33,610
for a while and so they related

1257
00:44:33,670 --> 00:44:33,820
how

1258
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:35,410
many doors would you say about three

1259
00:44:36,850 --> 00:44:38,410
but they rented a place to stay

1260
00:44:38,530 --> 00:44:40,030
so yeah yeah yeah because it's just

1261
00:44:40,053 --> 00:44:41,230
not my plan my plan was to

1262
00:44:41,230 --> 00:44:42,700
have them stay with me because it's

1263
00:44:42,833 --> 00:44:44,230
just kind of how we wrote that

1264
00:44:44,230 --> 00:44:46,180
also happens yeah you just talked to

1265
00:44:46,180 --> 00:44:47,350
tell john and you'll get a good

1266
00:44:47,350 --> 00:44:50,050
idea of like around when they got

1267
00:44:50,050 --> 00:44:52,300
really sick wow yeah because i feel

1268
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:53,410
like there's a part of you know

1269
00:44:53,410 --> 00:44:54,910
i've heard people say like you really

1270
00:44:54,910 --> 00:44:56,650
want to soak up the time

1271
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:58,600
and then other people are like like

1272
00:44:58,729 --> 00:45:00,130
like without them i just share with

1273
00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:01,750
just your partner and your baby and

1274
00:45:01,750 --> 00:45:02,830
then the other people are like no

1275
00:45:02,830 --> 00:45:04,510
you really want help and i feel

1276
00:45:04,510 --> 00:45:05,770
like i'm gonna want help but i

1277
00:45:05,770 --> 00:45:07,600
don't know why i wouldn't take that

1278
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:09,640
offer yeah yeah yeah yeah because there's

1279
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:11,200
so much to do in general that

1280
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:12,640
like the idea of someone just doing

1281
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:14,380
the dishes and laundry and you know

1282
00:45:14,380 --> 00:45:15,850
being there give me advice is really

1283
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:16,840
yeah that also

1284
00:45:16,870 --> 00:45:18,635
seems very natural to me you know

1285
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:20,440
and yeah i mean like it seems

1286
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:22,360
like it would be a very comforting

1287
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:24,580
presence to have somebody you know to

1288
00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:26,380
have your your your parents who have

1289
00:45:26,380 --> 00:45:28,660
been through this and they understand and

1290
00:45:28,690 --> 00:45:30,820
you know what i mean yeah i

1291
00:45:30,820 --> 00:45:32,740
think so what age do they go

1292
00:45:32,740 --> 00:45:35,140
to boarding school for you the kids

1293
00:45:35,140 --> 00:45:36,970
yeah like two until they were two

1294
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:37,540
or one

1295
00:45:40,390 --> 00:45:42,220
ship em off nine months a year

1296
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:44,200
and you'll have a wet nurse right

1297
00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:45,940
oh my god yeah she's been getting

1298
00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:51,100
her tinies already and ah i mean

1299
00:45:51,130 --> 00:45:53,200
is that is that concept is somebody

1300
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:55,540
who is capable of lactating that it's

1301
00:45:55,540 --> 00:45:57,760
that they never stop there they're always

1302
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:58,840
nursing so their breasts

1303
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:02,680

percent who's gonna do the other fifty

1341
00:47:13,570 --> 00:47:15,490

1342
00:47:15,490 --> 00:47:16,840
process is what a cook

1343
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:20,140

1344
00:47:20,140 --> 00:47:21,610
way out of doing it so yeah

1345
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:24,220
because guys seventy two hours man this

1347
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:29,020
i love it he's never changed a

1348
00:47:29,020 --> 00:47:31,120
diaper though and i mean i as

1349
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:32,830
we know my career was babysitting before

1350
00:47:32,830 --> 00:47:34,420
i became a movie star and high

1351
00:47:35,590 --> 00:47:40,330
ah i've changed thousands of diapers diaper

1352
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:41,800
yeah i mean i think a lot

1353
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:43,300
of men you know you never really

1354
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:45,370
had the opportunity a couple of when

1355
00:47:45,370 --> 00:47:46,420
my sister was young but it has

1356
00:47:46,420 --> 00:47:48,460
been so long that i don't remember

1357
00:47:48,460 --> 00:47:50,680
anything about it and probably diaper technologies

1358
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:53,741
totally changed since then nineteen year old

1359
00:47:53,741 --> 00:47:55,720
empty world safety pinning it

1360
00:47:55,750 --> 00:47:57,571
with like a cloth or some thing

1361
00:47:57,571 --> 00:47:59,350
i think i had to do pins

1362
00:47:59,350 --> 00:48:01,000
at the tab so now it's is

1363
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,490
very different now it's less hastened acres

1364
00:48:03,850 --> 00:48:05,830
i remember when i was like tabs

1365
00:48:06,130 --> 00:48:07,750
yeah when i was young i remember

1366
00:48:07,870 --> 00:48:10,240
we had those safety pins ah with

1367
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:13,150
like the little ducks ducks yeah yeah

1368
00:48:13,150 --> 00:48:14,740
yeah yeah oh were they were they

1369
00:48:14,740 --> 00:48:15,790
plastic or were they

1370
00:48:16,270 --> 00:48:17,680
point no they were metal pins they're

1371
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:19,810
metal yeah and it must have been

1372
00:48:19,810 --> 00:48:22,450
like only one company made pins because

1373
00:48:22,450 --> 00:48:23,710
everyone had the ones with the ducks

1374
00:48:23,710 --> 00:48:25,900
yeah yeah yeah like you back back

1375
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:27,130
when we were young back when paul

1376
00:48:27,130 --> 00:48:28,930
and i were young like people would

1377
00:48:28,930 --> 00:48:30,460
corner the market on that type of

1378
00:48:30,460 --> 00:48:32,080
thing now there's so much choice for

1379
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:33,850
every single thing that exists but that's

1380
00:48:33,850 --> 00:48:36,040
really it was like that one company

1381
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:37,240
you would make it because they would

1382
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:38,860
have the factory that could put the

1383
00:48:38,860 --> 00:48:41,260
parts together you know like i guess

1384
00:48:41,260 --> 00:48:42,910
that still happens like the the the

1385
00:48:42,910 --> 00:48:45,010
sort of kleenex effect we're all tissues

1386
00:48:45,010 --> 00:48:48,070
get called kleenex rain or xerox or

1387
00:48:48,070 --> 00:48:49,630
whatever but like what does it happen

1388
00:48:49,630 --> 00:48:51,040
with now like roomba

1389
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:54,340
i guess there's other robotic vacuums but

1390
00:48:54,910 --> 00:48:57,460
it doesn't seem as it doesn't seem

1391
00:48:57,460 --> 00:49:01,660
as ah prevalent anymore yeah yeah

1392
00:49:02,710 --> 00:49:05,350
yeah i was just i was just

1393
00:49:05,350 --> 00:49:07,030
watching this is us last night catching

1394
00:49:07,030 --> 00:49:08,890

1395
00:49:08,890 --> 00:49:10,690
episodes behind were like this was us

1396
00:49:10,750 --> 00:49:14,650
this was them but they ah they

1397
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:16,060
you know they flash back and forth

1398
00:49:16,060 --> 00:49:18,820
in time as i've explained and there's

1399
00:49:18,820 --> 00:49:20,519
like there's like a whole because now

1400
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:21,790
love the characters are having babies on

1401
00:49:21,790 --> 00:49:22,240
the show

1402
00:49:22,870 --> 00:49:24,550
and then they flashed back to when

1403
00:49:24,550 --> 00:49:26,440
they're dead was alive and he was

1404
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:27,940

the diapers and stuff in this i

1407
00:49:32,530 --> 00:49:36,190

1409
00:49:38,020 --> 00:49:40,390

1410
00:49:40,420 --> 00:49:42,070
all this baby powder which is now

1411
00:49:42,070 --> 00:49:43,000
like a base

1412
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,970
likely illegal like baby powder is like

1418
00:49:55,780 --> 00:49:57,970
decision you know but china and but

1419
00:49:58,150 --> 00:49:59,497

1423
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:04,360
powders that are fine but in my

1424
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:06,640

1427
00:50:11,050 --> 00:50:12,190

1428
00:50:14,151 --> 00:50:15,700
well imagine how smart you could be

1429
00:50:15,940 --> 00:50:16,840

1600
00:55:45,540 --> 00:55:47,010

00:59:06,060 --> 00:59:10,140
over the floor and you are both

1680
00:59:10,140 --> 00:59:13,980

00:59:13,980 --> 00:59:15,810
what it looks like it's okay i

1682
00:59:15,810 --> 00:59:17,490
don't know like i could understand that

1683
00:59:17,490 --> 00:59:18,960
you would take a look at this

1684
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:21,420
kind of situation and be aghast at

1685
00:59:21,420 --> 00:59:22,920
what it looks like but it certainly

1686
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:23,610
is not that

1687
00:59:23,730 --> 00:59:26,130
he certainly said your home is very

1688
00:59:26,130 --> 00:59:27,810
unsafe and so what we were trying

1689
00:59:27,810 --> 00:59:30,000
to do was figure out a sort

1690
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,520
of ah security system that you could

1691
00:59:32,520 --> 00:59:36,270
do every night first ah i was

1692
00:59:36,270 --> 00:59:39,660
going to get in the dishwasher you

1693
00:59:39,660 --> 00:59:41,910

1694
00:59:41,910 --> 00:59:43,680
surprise fees surprise ya

1695
00:59:44,040 --> 00:59:45,570
exactly i would know if they were

1696
00:59:45,570 --> 00:59:48,120
coming because i would hear the crunch

1697
00:59:48,540 --> 00:59:50,880
of the granola yeah on the floor

1698
00:59:50,910 --> 00:59:52,470
now and now i know what i

1699
00:59:52,470 --> 00:59:54,240
was doing was i was i was

1700
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:57,090
planning an escape route in case you

1701
00:59:57,090 --> 00:59:59,490

1702
00:59:59,490 --> 01:00:01,620

1703
01:00:01,650 --> 01:00:03,780
out this window here yes

1704
01:00:04,050 --> 01:00:06,840
and i found that i couldn't fit

1705
01:00:07,050 --> 01:00:08,310
so i was like you know what

1706
01:00:08,310 --> 01:00:09,690
this needs another level so i can

1707
01:00:09,690 --> 01:00:11,400
