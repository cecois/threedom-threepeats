i have heard of baby foot yeah

77
00:02:58,290 --> 00:02:59,370
so i don't know what this thing

78
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:00,960
basically you do scott is you put

79
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,180
this there's this gel and it comes

80
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:05,700
in these plastic bags and you put

81
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:06,985
your feet into the bags and you'd

82
00:03:06,985 --> 00:03:08,670
like tape them up and tape them

83
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:10,140
close and you put your feet in

84
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:10,320
them

85
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:11,760
for like forty five minutes or something

86
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,960
and then when you take them off

87
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:14,880
it looks like nothing happened but over

88
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:17,430
the course of two weeks your skin

89
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:19,830
will peel off on your feet revealing

90
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:22,260
the baby slayer of your foot so

91
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:24,960
soft so supple all the bad is

92
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,150
gone okay this you have a foot

93
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:29,430
fetish this sounds nice it was for

94
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:30,360
dramatic gift

95
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:32,850
way how do you see your skin

96
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:35,340
peeling off yeah peel it off you

97
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,170
shouldn't grab it yourself they say don't

98
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,940
heal yourself because even though you'll really

99
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:40,410
want to paul you really want to

100
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:42,209
because you they say that yeah i

101
00:03:42,209 --> 00:03:44,280
really want to it's gonna it says

102
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,140
like in like there's there's really powerful

103
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:47,730
really really really watching you've got you're

104
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:49,710
dying to your you gotta do it

105
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:50,430
you just gotta do it

106
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:52,410
but you can't do it because we

107
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:54,720
shouldn't do it because it basically kind

108
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,100
of messes up the process a little

109
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,530
bit because you start to appeal email

110
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:00,210
to the point where it's yeah you

111
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:02,043
you peel it to the old to

112
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:04,620
lessen baby to an embryo yeah it's

113
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,360
bad it goes back in time it

114
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,820
becomes a zygote this sounds like jackass

115
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:10,800
forever and ever well wait wait

116
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:12,390
wait wait for silly if you can

117
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:13,710
do it with your feet why can't

118
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:14,970
you do it everywhere like can't you

119
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:17,189
do with your face um i'm not

120
00:04:17,189 --> 00:04:19,527
avoiding arms you know the thing is

121
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:21,870
what about baby feet is that it

122
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:23,400
says don't use it if you're pregnant

123
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,810
or breast-feeding only things i'm like i

124
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:26,610
wonder what's going on with baby jumps

125
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:28,230
and so to me i would just

126
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:29,370
put it on my feet because it's

127
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:30,960
like that seems pretty low

128
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,120
no stakes and it works out really

129
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,620
well anything above the ankles though you

130
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:36,450
wouldn't you wouldn't dare i'm not covered

131
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:38,160
in calluses anywhere else i would say

132
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,510
what about your ashy elbows all my

133
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:44,760
my ass is complete as a callous

134
00:04:45,932 --> 00:04:48,120
you want cow is probably true all

135
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:51,300
our asses are kind of callous asses

136
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,160
are calluses because they're

137
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:55,500

200
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:08,730
you have done it who would have

201
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:10,290
well can where you're going is there

202
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:12,240
like postmates or grocery delivery and will

203
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:12,930
you need roads

204
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,770
because you are a pager with doc

205
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:18,540

00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:27,810
the hotel would provide and oh let's

210
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:29,940

on this we've been together too long

230
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,774
it's not meaningless to have gotten higher

231
00:08:12,774 --> 00:08:13,893
of course getting each other stuff for

232
00:08:13,893 --> 00:08:16,170
value like we do every year yes

233
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:19,620
paul yoni anything real no we don't

234
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:22,650
really observe it um and i and

235
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:25,140
listen i've checked with her so many

236
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:27,030
times like you don't really you don't

237
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:28,230
care about this right she goes no

238
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:29,760
and i'm like does she secretly and

239
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,290
she's just lying here's what i think

240
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:31,740
you should do

241
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,820
i it's not hard okay just twenty

242
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:36,210
years

243
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,830
because she says she doesn't care it's

244
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:42,030
it's just gonna be a fun surprise

245
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:43,110
you just go get her a bouquet

246
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:44,280
of flowers but then he has to

247
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,290
do it every year we'd hasn't announced

248
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:49,860
attention to that every year two things

249
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:52,192
one time she did one time want

250
00:08:52,192 --> 00:08:54,180
to go out for valentine's day and

251
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:55,170

255
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:02,820

418
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:43,520
my mind is more like

419
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:53,660
always think for yourself ah

420
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:58,490

sister-in-law she's very much like that too

423
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:05,420

424
00:15:05,450 --> 00:15:07,070

00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:09,590
to keep it together man na and

look janey and i are hanging by

428
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:14,510
a thread and so i don't think

429
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:15,050
this is going to do

430
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:17,870
do it so yeah everything's in such

431
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:20,120
peril that pays not gonna turn it

432
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,040
around yeah i think it would actually

433
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,750
hurt more than help yeah because she's

434
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:25,055
gonna go oh you think i'm fucking

435
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:26,840
around and say you don't pay attention

436
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,850
i don't like valentine's day i already

437
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:30,560
told you that and by the way

438
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:33,380
paul took janey to jackass forever

439
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:36,800
on that i wish yeah i love

440
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,740
that um it was it was really

441
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:42,950
fun um janey this was her first

442
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:45,470
experience with jackass of any sort why

443
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:47,390
yes she'd never seen any of us

444
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:50,450
love the show she was not i

445
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,040
would not say she was an enthusiastic

446
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,360
fan i think i don't think it's

447
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:54,170
i don't think now is the time

448
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:55,460
i'm to be introduced i think i

449
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:57,410
was saying oh yeah this one is

450
00:15:57,410 --> 00:16:00,200
a little too a little more extreme

451
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,820
than the others didn't certain aspects of

452
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:04,250
it so it's like it's like we

453
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,840
we paul and i have seen previous

454
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,460
ones and were like charmed by it

455
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:08,720
are won over by it and now

456
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,400
for this one to be someone's first

457
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:12,740
ah it would be yeah it would

458
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:14,330
be a little weird yeah i think

459
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,430
but she started off kind of laughing

460
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:18,320
at you know but as it went

461
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,030
on she was laughing less and less

462
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:21,710
there were things that she just could

463
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:23,720
not look at like anything with bugs

464
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:26,300
anything with you know obama it's whatever

465
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:28,490
kind of went off on them did

466
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:30,920

00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:30,590
went on this hike and he was

555
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:32,750
actively not enjoying being on the hike

556
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:35,750
because of course not family yeah that

557
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:38,120
wasn't enjoyable to him but but then

558
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,050
also mad

559
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:40,910
mads that i couldn't just point out

560
00:19:40,910 --> 00:19:43,310

and he entered wasn't looking at it

563
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:49,610
and it scampered away yeah you missed

564
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:51,290
a lizard so he never saw anything

565
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:52,970
i don't think he ever thought well

566
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:54,200

567
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,090
at one point and we checked off

568
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:57,830

00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:59,000
be funny to them online

through our yard from the back and

624
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:49,060
then go out driving through our yard

625
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:52,930
yeah and we catch the moscow front

626
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:54,760
and kissed him on the cameras and

627
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:55,990
they'll it'll be in the middle of

628
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:58,930
the afternoon cameras made and we don't

629
00:21:58,930 --> 00:22:00,580
have turned noon we no longer let

630
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:02,643
our dogs out on cash

631
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:05,530
you can't cannot you must not so

632
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:08,890
but then then our neighbor came over

633
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:10,780
like i guess or the one of

634
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:12,640
our neighbors is this very elderly woman

635
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,740
so someone on her behalf came over

636
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:17,140
and and said a lot of the

637
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:19,660
coyotes are jumping over our fence into

638
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:21,580
her yard and then just like laying

639
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:22,630
there all afternoon

640
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:24,700
no and there were like is there

641
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:26,830
any way you can raise your fence

642
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:28,570
up so they can't get over and

643
00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:29,886
so we we measured the fence and

644
00:22:29,886 --> 00:22:31,450
it's like five and a half feet

645
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,710
but the tallest you can have it

646
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:34,990
is six so we're like we're not

647
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:37,450
going to spend thousands of dollars to

648
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:39,670
raise and they can jump over six

649
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:41,439
we have a six feet foot fence

650
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:42,970
jumped all the time some

651
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:44,500
spikes on it or some you know

652
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,420
like we're alright no angles at the

653
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:48,460
top it's like a movie dangerous but

654
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:50,710
like like like spikes with other coyotes

655
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:52,780

00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:05,800
lot of money and then bombed right

745
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:07,420
but then he he he has like

746
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,790
his company has like a formula right

747
00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:12,100

750
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:20,320
keeping formula for ten by the way

751
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:22,690
i know come on it's been so

752
00:26:22,698 --> 00:26:24,040

so hard first four hundred and eight

755
00:26:28,330 --> 00:26:29,590
but they have a formula where it's

756
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:31,330
like this this is how much money

757
00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:32,350
it's going to cost and this is

758
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:32,470
how

821
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:01,480
understanding with your private dancer where you

822
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,100
couldn't tell she said deutsche marks are

823
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:04,900
dollars yeah and because she was singing

824
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:06,250
it and i'm like just say it

825
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,980
but wait is it about someone grinding

826
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:10,450
on someone or just someone who's like

827
00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:12,430

ballet style for me yeah that's what

829
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:17,560
it is that's that's what i choose

830
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:20,080
to plead oh you're so so wholesome

831
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:23,736
you were miserable we just are scott

832
00:29:23,736 --> 00:29:25,960
you can't change do you remember paul

833
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:28,150
when the song erotic city came out

834
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:31,450
and how prince's erotic city did you

835
00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:33,220
ever know it was played on kiss

836
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:35,320
fm here and it was shocking to

837
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,670
me because i might know it if

838
00:29:36,670 --> 00:29:38,260
i heard it but i deliriously these

839
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:40,870
are the lyrics we can fuck until

840
00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:41,080
the

841
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:44,470
dawn making love till cherry's gone boo

842
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:47,410
tilled til it's gone yeah hope still

843
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:48,250

844
00:29:49,613 --> 00:29:51,610
yeah kinda like dimon kind of keep

845
00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:54,610
going but okay so the plausible deniability

846
00:29:54,610 --> 00:29:56,380
is prince says he's saying we can

847
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:59,500
funk until the dawn of course it

848
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:00,940
does not sound like you're saying funk

849
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:02,200
it just sounds like and by the

850
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:02,620
way

851
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,350
the very next line is making love

852
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:08,014
till cherry's gone right do they didn't

853
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:10,840

867
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:43,670

868
00:30:43,670 --> 00:30:45,560
old you read about him in newsweek

869
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:46,940

870
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:47,840
law

871
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:50,540

872
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:53,360
a good two weeks um unedited on

873
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,730
kiss fm top forty radio and they

874
00:30:55,730 --> 00:30:57,440
must have gotten so many complaints but

875
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,610
this was prince at the height of

876
00:30:58,610 --> 00:31:01,520
his powers that they had to play

877
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,650
it because he was a hit so

878
00:31:03,650 --> 00:31:06,530
they then did it like a mix

879
00:31:06,530 --> 00:31:08,420
where they took out that one line

880
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:09,140
and like

881
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:11,090
like did did a backwards thing they'd

882
00:31:11,090 --> 00:31:12,890
never believed it or whatever but it

883
00:31:12,890 --> 00:31:14,450
was just it was crazy to me

884
00:31:14,450 --> 00:31:15,770
that they thought they could get away

885
00:31:15,770 --> 00:31:16,970

00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,130
when i was a kid yeah that

923
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:44,660
was a big deal oh yeah never

924
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:47,450
read that all my female relatives my

925
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:50,330
cousins and all that all loved they

926
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,170
well i don't know if they loved

927
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:52,850
it but they talked about it because

928
00:32:52,850 --> 00:32:53,990
it was it was they were trapped

929
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:55,010
in an attic because that what it

930
00:32:55,010 --> 00:32:55,430
was

931
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:57,770
yes it was it was kids who

932
00:32:57,770 --> 00:33:00,560
were among a lady where we were

933
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:02,360
yeah it was raising these kids and

934
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:03,620
she trapped them in the attic so

935
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:04,730
it wasn't like an ambush traps in

936
00:33:04,730 --> 00:33:06,890
the attic no it was not an

937
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:08,600
frankly we're not hiding they just weren't

938
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:10,220
allowed out okay and then they they

939
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:12,200
were and then they they were so

940
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:13,280
they were growing up they had to

941
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,150
grow up this way and they were

942
00:33:14,150 --> 00:33:15,272
so horny that there's so

943
00:33:15,804 --> 00:33:17,570
together yeah they were the only people

944
00:33:17,570 --> 00:33:18,950
they ever saw i don't know if

945
00:33:18,950 --> 00:33:21,530
we can try to justify what happened

946
00:33:21,530 --> 00:33:24,890
in the book i mean if you're

947
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,870
that horny what if one of them

948
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:28,640
had been gay okay you are fourteen

949
00:33:28,670 --> 00:33:29,747
and then the other ones like are

950
00:33:29,747 --> 00:33:30,800
you fucking kidding

951
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:34,070

sorry doesn't do it for me

953
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:40,340
um that would be a bad situation

954
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:41,750
to be trapped in an attic i

955
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:43,610
believe that would be bad as well

956
00:33:43,670 --> 00:33:45,890
but there's an upside to it yeah

957
00:33:46,430 --> 00:33:49,610
thing is nothing is completely terrible yeah

and here's what's so uncreative and stupid

1104
00:38:57,860 --> 00:39:00,290
it's very stupid although i'm jealous what

1105
00:39:00,290 --> 00:39:02,510
i love about giving the storm what

1106
00:39:02,510 --> 00:39:03,230
i love about that store at the

1107
00:39:03,230 --> 00:39:04,100
grove is that it's really

1108
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:05,870
early part of the farmers' market so

1109
00:39:05,870 --> 00:39:07,490
like yeah still smelled the fish of

1110
00:39:07,490 --> 00:39:09,530
the farmers market yeah now you turn

1111
00:39:09,530 --> 00:39:11,300
that corner and then there's this like

1112
00:39:11,330 --> 00:39:14,390
open-air stall of taschen books it's it's

1113
00:39:14,390 --> 00:39:17,090
so incongruous with where it is that's

1114
00:39:17,090 --> 00:39:18,470
why a lot of the same weird

1115
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:20,270
but you know i just i don't

1116
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:22,370
i don't like the idea of just

1117
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:24,170
having a collection just being

1118
00:39:24,470 --> 00:39:26,690
i'll just take all of those it's

1119
00:39:26,690 --> 00:39:28,250
like so like he never opened one

1120
00:39:28,250 --> 00:39:29,810
he doesn't care oh well we are

1121
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:31,670

1123
00:39:33,470 --> 00:39:34,700

00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:35,810
one while we were there no and

1125
00:39:35,810 --> 00:39:36,950

1127
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:39,620
kind of like once to my house

1128
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:40,668
is filled with them i've never opened

1129
00:39:40,668 --> 00:39:42,470

1132
00:39:44,450 --> 00:39:45,650
to go look and see what they

1133
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:48,050
are but one is like um i

1134
00:39:48,050 --> 00:39:51,560
can't tell you ah oh yeah i

1135
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:53,048

00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:56,300
picture dicks yeah well it's kind of

1137
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:57,530
like actually it was a thing that

1138
00:39:57,530 --> 00:39:59,360
like mike's agent would like give him

1139
00:39:59,450 --> 00:40:01,730
ah these big books everyone's soil so

1140
00:40:01,730 --> 00:40:03,320
that's cool yeah it's a nice gift

1141
00:40:04,130 --> 00:40:04,550
but ah

1142
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:06,410
there's just really every job next time

1143
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:10,730
hey how about you stop that's anytime

1144
00:40:10,730 --> 00:40:13,190
my agent giving christmas gift it's like

1145
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:14,900
hey how about a job instead yeah

1146
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:18,050
why do you direct this energy for

1147
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:20,330
buying books towards pitching me to people

1148
00:40:22,910 --> 00:40:24,950
it's not their job oh is it

1149
00:40:24,950 --> 00:40:26,540
all they can do negotiate the deal

1150
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:27,500
exactly this

1151
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:32,250
agents only can negotiate deals and managers

1152
00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:33,600
can only give you advice about what

1153
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,460
you should be doing yourself badly this

1154
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:36,510
is exactly right

1155
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:39,390
yeah what's up with that what's up

1156
00:40:39,390 --> 00:40:43,770

they seeing what what's now what up

1161
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:54,450
with that that should be the whole

1162
00:40:54,450 --> 00:40:56,100
premise of an episode i'm just always

1163
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:57,270

away but they're like they're just brand

1221
00:42:54,990 --> 00:42:57,330
ambassadors they they really it's like it's

1222
00:42:57,330 --> 00:42:59,310
like a program that you do out

1223
00:42:59,310 --> 00:43:02,070

00:43:14,970 --> 00:43:16,800
where where does it originate from and

1231
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:17,880
maybe we should go there in the

1232
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:19,200
morning and stick it out and then

1233
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:21,360

i don't

1236
00:43:23,970 --> 00:43:26,070
i believe it originates in los angeles

1237
00:43:26,070 --> 00:43:28,560
i think it's been somewhere else yo

1238
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:30,750
we're gonna to fly there but yeah

1239
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:32,040

1328
00:46:50,010 --> 00:46:53,070
of video of little kids coming in

1329
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:55,710
and disturbing people broadcasting live with the

1330
00:46:55,740 --> 00:46:57,990
acquisition zoom so we absolute best it

1331
00:46:57,990 --> 00:47:00,060
happened you just have the genre it

1332
00:47:00,060 --> 00:47:01,410
should happen all the time it should

1333
00:47:01,410 --> 00:47:02,730
to be a reliable thing that we

1334
00:47:02,730 --> 00:47:05,070
all celebrate instead of someone getting embarrassed

1335
00:47:05,070 --> 00:47:06,300
but i love when they get embarrassed

1336
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:08,400
too but it brings everyone down to

1337
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:09,330
earth you know it's a you you

1338
00:47:09,330 --> 00:47:10,950
think you're so special on the news

1339
00:47:10,950 --> 00:47:12,150
while it comes your kid talking about

1340
00:47:12,150 --> 00:47:12,960
how they just pooped up

1341
00:47:14,220 --> 00:47:15,480
i love it so much

1342
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:19,140
is the best the best one is

1343
00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:20,820
it the okay the one i'm thinking

1344
00:47:20,820 --> 00:47:22,920
of where the where the nanny came

1345
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:24,600
in and got the kid yeah well

1346
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:26,250
like some yeah that was his wife

1347
00:47:26,250 --> 00:47:29,130
yeah thank oh sorry paul but like

1348
00:47:29,130 --> 00:47:30,600
she was trying to know what happened

1349
00:47:30,630 --> 00:47:31,680
she's trying to duck out of the

1350
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:32,760
way and all that kind of stuff

1351
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:34,440
that was that's the gold standard that's

1352
00:47:34,470 --> 00:47:36,690
part is that little girl mm

1353
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:38,940
marching in there like the way she

1354
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:41,010

00:48:03,690 --> 00:48:04,770
when it's one girl and she goes

what was happening so i'm not turning

1504
00:52:51,605 --> 00:52:52,805
myself to be some saint but i

1505
00:52:52,815 --> 00:52:53,975
didn't understand what was happening when i

1506
00:52:53,975 --> 00:52:57,005
watched this video and and he posted

1507
00:52:57,035 --> 00:52:59,465
it being like oh this really got

1508
00:52:59,465 --> 00:53:00,725
me out and and then i was

1509
00:53:00,725 --> 00:53:02,075
like what is happening i can't figure

1510
00:53:02,075 --> 00:53:03,605
out why this is funny so what

1511
00:53:03,605 --> 00:53:05,915
it is is you hear it's just

1512
00:53:05,915 --> 00:53:07,865
clips of people playing this one sound

1513
00:53:07,865 --> 00:53:08,735
clip and then they see if the

1514
00:53:08,735 --> 00:53:10,325
person next to them turns to look

1515
00:53:10,325 --> 00:53:11,975
because of the sound that they're hearing

1516
00:53:12,365 --> 00:53:14,375
and it's a little musical sting and

1517
00:53:14,375 --> 00:53:15,845
then if the person looks they go

1518
00:53:15,845 --> 00:53:17,165
oh good and if

1519
00:53:17,195 --> 00:53:19,055
they don't look like who and then

1520
00:53:19,055 --> 00:53:21,395
i figured out from someone else commenting

1521
00:53:21,395 --> 00:53:23,735
that it's ah the beginning of porn

1522
00:53:24,335 --> 00:53:25,535
like a lot of porn videos start

1523
00:53:25,535 --> 00:53:27,935
with the same musical sting and so

1524
00:53:27,935 --> 00:53:29,465
if the person looks it's like they

1525
00:53:29,525 --> 00:53:31,045
think that you're either watching porn or

1526
00:53:31,115 --> 00:53:33,845
basically leading the way watch porn like

1527
00:53:34,085 --> 00:53:35,584
this what is what the bid or

1528
00:53:35,584 --> 00:53:37,325
whatever and so it's like people

1529
00:53:37,325 --> 00:53:39,005
i like getting to see seeing if

1530
00:53:39,005 --> 00:53:40,356
their brother will like turn and go

1531
00:53:40,356 --> 00:53:42,185
oh or something like is it as

1532
00:53:42,185 --> 00:53:44,525
recognizable is like the netflix jumped on

1533
00:53:44,825 --> 00:53:46,055
i think it is if you watch

1534
00:53:46,355 --> 00:53:48,305
porn is it that yeah is it

1535
00:53:48,305 --> 00:53:50,645
that don't don't it goes like steal

1536
00:53:50,645 --> 00:53:51,335
that from porn

1537
00:53:52,565 --> 00:53:54,095
it's like you're hoping nobody would see

1538
00:53:54,095 --> 00:53:55,595
me i can't i can't i can't

1539
00:53:55,895 --> 00:53:56,765
do it in freshman

1540
00:53:57,965 --> 00:53:59,345
is it like law and order don't

1541
00:53:59,345 --> 00:54:03,455
don't ah and thinking gung gung air

1542
00:54:03,605 --> 00:54:05,550
and let me say good vale and

1543
00:54:05,855 --> 00:54:06,995
that's the to me that is the

1544
00:54:06,995 --> 00:54:08,135
best part of the loan or theme

1545
00:54:09,275 --> 00:54:10,925
yeah that's a good here okay tick

1546
00:54:10,925 --> 00:54:12,995
tock audio trend attempts to catch people

1547
00:54:12,995 --> 00:54:14,645
who watch pornhub also begin play the

1548
00:54:14,645 --> 00:54:15,215
sound

1549
00:54:17,435 --> 00:54:19,445
hold on but then if you're doing

1550
00:54:19,445 --> 00:54:20,645
it then you also watch porn

1551
00:54:23,975 --> 00:54:25,103
so then it goes into de la

1552
00:54:25,103 --> 00:54:26,615
liga who we couldn't hear it but

1553
00:54:26,675 --> 00:54:28,115
we can learn we couldn't hear any

1554
00:54:31,115 --> 00:54:32,705
it's that it's drums

1555
00:54:36,605 --> 00:54:39,515
okay i don't know okay okay alright

1556
00:54:40,475 --> 00:54:42,095
but my feeling is if someone's playing

1557
00:54:42,095 --> 00:54:43,235
a sound next to me i'm gonna

1558
00:54:43,235 --> 00:54:46,805
look yeah but yeah any sound i

1559
00:54:46,805 --> 00:54:48,155
answer depends of the look on your

1560
00:54:48,155 --> 00:54:50,195
face if you if you turn right

1561
00:54:51,215 --> 00:54:52,565
for people like you why are you

1562
00:54:52,565 --> 00:54:54,275
watching porn then they go you will

1563
00:54:54,275 --> 00:54:57,035
ex porn a got you got you

1564
00:54:57,095 --> 00:54:59,375
i got you see a man who

1565
00:54:59,435 --> 00:55:00,485
just seems confusing

1566
00:55:01,655 --> 00:55:03,065
now i watch porn but i don't

1567
00:55:03,095 --> 00:55:05,105

1568
00:55:05,165 --> 00:55:06,455
kind of a cool guy i want

1569
00:55:07,175 --> 00:55:08,555

00:55:08,555 --> 00:55:09,935
interpretive dances to it

1571
00:55:12,335 --> 00:55:13,625
i'm sure you're like the dialogue as

1572
00:55:13,625 --> 00:55:15,875
well as the music whatever happens happens

1573
00:55:16,265 --> 00:55:17,975

were a brick and mortar storefront they

1899
01:07:52,895 --> 01:07:54,605

1900
01:07:54,605 --> 01:07:55,895
back and a sort of red brick

1901
01:07:55,895 --> 01:07:58,235

1913
01:08:20,225 --> 01:08:22,265

1915
01:08:23,885 --> 01:08:24,305

his own version of the song on

2061
01:13:55,320 --> 01:13:57,270
an album called

2062
01:13:58,380 --> 01:13:59,790
baptist something

2063
01:14:01,230 --> 01:14:03,630
baptist the word baptist was in it

2064
01:14:03,960 --> 01:14:06,780
okay and the critical reception

2065
01:14:07,933 --> 01:14:10,770
was not the best it was it

2066
01:14:10,770 --> 01:14:14,280
was called by the trouser press a

2067
01:14:14,280 --> 01:14:17,220
song that was sardonic these are direct

2068
01:14:17,220 --> 01:14:21,030
quotes sardonic and that it quote seethes

2069
01:14:21,061 --> 01:14:23,550
with disdain and quote is that a

2070
01:14:23,550 --> 01:14:25,950
bad review because there are certain songs

2071
01:14:25,950 --> 01:14:28,050
that would have both of those qualities

2072
01:14:28,080 --> 01:14:30,120
that would get good reviews well it's

2073
01:14:30,120 --> 01:14:31,620
a bad review because those are negative

2074
01:14:31,620 --> 01:14:35,190
things well okay but like if i

2075
01:14:35,190 --> 01:14:36,780

2076
01:14:36,780 --> 01:14:38,190

2094
01:15:14,670 --> 01:15:17,820
um in my research there was not

2095
01:15:17,820 --> 01:15:21,030
another band named but it's entirely possible

2096
01:15:21,030 --> 01:15:23,460
that you're doing with your doing a

2097
01:15:23,460 --> 01:15:25,800
whole ted talk about this woman's song

2098
01:15:25,800 --> 01:15:27,180
that you don't even know yeah saying

2099
01:15:27,180 --> 01:15:28,530
for a different about the

2100
01:15:28,530 --> 01:15:30,510
the song the the whatever band she

2101
01:15:30,510 --> 01:15:31,710
may or may not have sung for

2102
01:15:31,710 --> 01:15:33,210
in the past has no bearing on

2103
01:15:33,210 --> 01:15:35,640
her single her solo single that was

2104
01:15:35,640 --> 01:15:37,560
the number two track off her album

2105
01:15:37,590 --> 01:15:39,000
but don't have a great name the

2106
01:15:39,300 --> 01:15:40,980
far more success as the singer of

2107
01:15:40,980 --> 01:15:42,180
this band than she did in her

2108
01:15:42,180 --> 01:15:44,670
