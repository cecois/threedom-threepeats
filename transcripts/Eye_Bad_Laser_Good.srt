all the weight back on that loss

277
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,190

278
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:30,450
accept that i'm like an up and

279
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:32,250
down guy i was a youth hath

280
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:33,540
yeah yeah yeah i don't know i

281
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:34,770
think it's so hard because i

282
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,600
like yeah it's like i because you

283
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,940
don't want to talk about those ryan

00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:42,930
ah rosenberg um that number chosen berg

285
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:45,870
that um it's you get to a

286
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:48,360
point where you feel ah mentally healthier

287
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,320
saying that you know what i'm not

288
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,850
going to beat myself up about this

289
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:53,670
whatever but then you get past that

290
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:54,960
point you're like i shouldn't be

291
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:58,080
myself up a little bit yeah but

292
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,730
it is it's that the idea of

293
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:02,910
like loving yourself at any size or

294
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:04,727
whatever well first of all the idea

295
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:07,200

296
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,020
talking welcome to my world easier to

297
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:12,000
attain but i like the idea of

298
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:14,340
when my idea of loving yourself at

299
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:15,120
all is such a

300
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:17,580
sing to me that i still grapple

301
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:19,680
with because it's not like a concept

302
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:21,930
that i was brought up with yeah

303
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:23,280
and it's you know it's like such

304
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,170
a strange business it's also like well

305
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:26,693
what does that feel like you know

306
00:10:26,755 --> 00:10:27,960
the name of you if you love

307
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,580
yourself and i guess it's just like

308
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:31,530
you just need giving yourself a break

309
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:33,810
what you need more bd big dick

310
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:34,380

overwhelm myself and then not do it

429
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:16,950

i have a few minutes

449
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:56,160
as opposed to scrolling yeah we didn't

450
00:14:56,190 --> 00:14:57,810
we didn't know screens in the bedroom

451
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,790
rule i did that for a while

452
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:01,500
and i think maybe no tax that

453
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:02,400
we don't have tv we don't have

454
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,980
a tv either yeah yeah the screens

455
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:07,080
janie every once in a while once

456
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:07,920
that like if we go to a

457
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,080
hotel times it sounds great like wouldn't

458
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,520
it be like at home if we

459
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:13,590
if whatever we've had yeah i'm watching

460
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:17,250
msnbc at eleven thirty at night think

461
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:19,230
if we could watch an episode of

462
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:21,990
suits it's maybe the ultimate indulgence to

463
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:23,250
have a tv at the foot of

464
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:24,300
your bed i used to have a

465
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,790
tv in my bedroom and i remember

466
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:28,890

472
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:41,310

is terrible but your veins i'm just

592
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,840
your body's here you actually getting your

593
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,940

594
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:44,640
i'm here for them

595
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:48,750
saying you just get one owners because

596
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:49,230
they were want

597
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,720
i'm in the medical videos we should

598
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:54,150
get more than one i know unfair

599
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:56,400
it is i also think if you

600
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,020
lose weight it should never come back

601
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:00,210
on but what if you knew it

602
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:03,330
too for what i mean you if

603
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:05,190
you lost weight because you were sick

604
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:06,570
and then you needed the weight oh

605
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:08,040
right right no i think it should

606
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,470
be if it's intentional okay it just

607
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,600
sucks they work out and get toned

608
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:14,130
it should stay that way but yes

609
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,020
it just sucks that like a year

610
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:18,240
a year was it eaten yeah a

611
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,300
year ago i was like working out

612
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:22,770
all the time gain a lot of

613
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:25,470
muscle super skinny yeah and now it's

614
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,270
all gone yeah yeah it's it's not

615
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:29,070
fair it should not be like how

616
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:30,540
can we get a whole second

617
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:33,860
but nothing else regenerates i know that's

618
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:35,390
like i'm getting enough here to die

619
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:37,340
like you'd come in yeah when you

620
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,020
should switch the old ones out when

621
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:40,550
you use brand-new and you've heard the

622
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:42,230
chief write another one just she gaps

623
00:20:42,304 --> 00:20:43,070
right hey

624
00:20:43,387 --> 00:20:45,860
my floater in my eye no no

625
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:49,430
loner um floater of what i have

626
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:51,170
flowed or for us

627
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:53,510
it's debris i don't know it's just

628
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:55,520
a little it's ah it's part of

629
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,020
the gel of your i can kind

630
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:59,810
of come detached and be floating in

631
00:20:59,810 --> 00:21:01,430
your eyes but i was having it

632
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:02,840
where i couldn't see past it and

633
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:03,740
i was feeling kind of like this

634
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:05,387
might be bad so then i it

635
00:21:05,387 --> 00:21:06,530
was lasting for like a week and

636
00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:08,870
then i went into the doctor and

637
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,730
they took the pictures of my eye

638
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:11,780
and you could see it which i

639
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:12,530
thought that was very

640
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:14,090
validating because there's a party going on

641
00:21:14,096 --> 00:21:15,944
crazy yeah yeah yeah more than loader

642
00:21:15,944 --> 00:21:17,870
is like call me crazy narrative yes

643
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:20,180
yes because it's like a semi invisible

644
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:22,400
light yeah like it's not it's actually

645
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,080
a thing floating in the eye they

646
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,870
could see it and then the there

647
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:28,220
is a surgery you could do but

648
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:29,390
it wasn't that dramatic but they were

649
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:31,250
like the other option is you just

650
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:32,690
wait and eventually your eyes will

651
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,760
see around it and like i still

652
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,380
see it sometimes it's really annoying yeah

653
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:38,240
it's nice photos i haven't got them

654
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,310
in awhile my boot is so bad

655
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:42,590
i stuff is very scary i know

656
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:43,940
you know i have that i've i've

657
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,110
i believe i've told you that said

658
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:46,910
that like ah like sort of crumbly

659
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:49,100
pigment in my eye that causes pressure

660
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:51,320
and yeah glaucoma so every once in

661
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,429
awhile i'll have to go to an

662
00:21:52,429 --> 00:21:52,850
ophthalmol

663
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,710
just to get checked out and sometimes

664
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:56,870
they will if it's if it's bad

665
00:21:56,870 --> 00:21:59,120
they will zap lasers into my eyes

666
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:01,850
wow just like star wars laser sources

667
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,020
what does it make the sound

668
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:06,740
it breaks up the um the the

669
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:09,380
pigment that's like collecting in a certain

670
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:10,730
place where it's not supposed to be

671
00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:13,970
so it levels it's like so complicated

672
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:15,800
like they show me the thing like

673
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:18,080

00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,337

his life is so interesting and i

929
00:30:49,575 --> 00:30:51,405

oh okay my mom always said that

933
00:30:56,655 --> 00:30:57,975

946
00:31:25,935 --> 00:31:27,885
not be comedic like i'm like the

947
00:31:27,915 --> 00:31:29,355

00:31:57,225 --> 00:31:58,815
person okay yeah yes like

00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:00,825
it's just who you would want to

963
00:32:00,975 --> 00:32:03,945
yeah their life story right you know

964
00:32:03,945 --> 00:32:05,445
what i mean this is not somebody

00:32:05,445 --> 00:32:08,505
that i admire but um the story

966
00:32:08,505 --> 00:32:11,295
of um h h holmes who was

967
00:32:11,295 --> 00:32:14,775
a famous ah serial killer in chicago

968
00:32:15,105 --> 00:32:16,905
um around the time of the world's

969
00:32:16,905 --> 00:32:18,855
fair he had one piece referred to

970
00:32:18,855 --> 00:32:18,975
as

971
00:32:19,095 --> 00:32:22,455
the murder castle well um and he

972
00:32:22,515 --> 00:32:25,035
like built this crazy house and he

973
00:32:25,035 --> 00:32:26,655
lured people there because people come from

974
00:32:26,655 --> 00:32:28,245
out of town and he would link

975
00:32:28,245 --> 00:32:30,015
to webinar and kill them and all

976
00:32:30,015 --> 00:32:32,085
these various ways it's like a very

977
00:32:32,085 --> 00:32:34,185
very dark story crazy there's there's what

978
00:32:34,185 --> 00:32:35,595
that book is the devil in the

979
00:32:35,595 --> 00:32:37,154
white city yeah yeah they they just

980
00:32:37,155 --> 00:32:39,096
saw that it's about that and the

981
00:32:39,135 --> 00:32:40,425
world's fair at the same time it's

982
00:32:40,425 --> 00:32:41,715
a great book but they just heard

983
00:32:41,715 --> 00:32:43,425
i've heard i didn't just fall apart

984
00:32:43,425 --> 00:32:44,865
like keanu just dropped out of it

985
00:32:44,865 --> 00:32:46,485
or whatever so it gets in they've

986
00:32:46,485 --> 00:32:47,747
been trying to make a tom cruise

987
00:32:47,747 --> 00:32:48,675
is going to do it for and

988
00:32:48,675 --> 00:32:50,535
i think that and and i think

989
00:32:50,535 --> 00:32:52,605
he honored keanu was getting made and

990
00:32:52,605 --> 00:32:53,565
he just dropped out of it so

991
00:32:53,565 --> 00:32:55,605
it's available you should do it sure

992
00:32:55,695 --> 00:32:57,465
if those guys i mean i guess

993
00:32:57,465 --> 00:32:59,145
they're done looking for famous but yeah

994
00:32:59,835 --> 00:33:01,545
so i think i read it too

995
00:33:02,535 --> 00:33:04,425
what should i just tell them i'm

996
00:33:04,455 --> 00:33:07,005
open yeah like just volunteered on avail

997
00:33:07,005 --> 00:33:08,325
a lot just luck if you can't

998
00:33:08,325 --> 00:33:10,725
get anybody i'll do it yeah but

999
00:33:10,725 --> 00:33:12,375
those two were we were talking about

1000
00:33:12,375 --> 00:33:15,195
this recently they're they're very contemporary actors

1001
00:33:15,195 --> 00:33:16,485
and i don't think it would have

1002
00:33:16,485 --> 00:33:18,525
worked with them at in that time

1003
00:33:18,525 --> 00:33:19,455
period right now

1004
00:33:19,455 --> 00:33:21,015
oh i see i like keanu could

1005
00:33:21,015 --> 00:33:22,635
pull anything off i can take yeah

1006
00:33:22,665 --> 00:33:24,165
but i mean a lot to not

1007
00:33:24,195 --> 00:33:26,715
hey tom cruise no you don't think

1008
00:33:26,715 --> 00:33:28,485
tom cruise can pull anything off well

1009
00:33:28,485 --> 00:33:29,595
we were taught we were talking about

1010
00:33:29,595 --> 00:33:31,485
this on another show it's true we

1011
00:33:31,485 --> 00:33:33,165
can say now is yeah it's our

1012
00:33:33,195 --> 00:33:35,805
interview with vampire vampires he's just ridiculous

1013
00:33:35,835 --> 00:33:38,385
play the vampire let's not die

1014
00:33:39,875 --> 00:33:41,775
like a massacre him anytime he was

1015
00:33:41,775 --> 00:33:44,295
on screen people would think doing things

1016
00:33:44,325 --> 00:33:46,425
things they think what that he was

1017
00:33:46,425 --> 00:33:49,395
like more of a renaissance renaissance renaissance

1018
00:33:49,395 --> 00:33:50,565
dam canada yeah

1019
00:33:51,645 --> 00:33:53,475
i would play watch that actually now

1020
00:33:53,475 --> 00:33:54,405
that you're saying you can view the

1021
00:33:54,405 --> 00:33:56,955
vampire yeah have fun this man it's

1022
00:33:56,955 --> 00:33:57,375
not good

1023
00:33:59,085 --> 00:34:00,615
it's not good i think that was

1024
00:34:00,615 --> 00:34:02,091
such a big movie at the time

1025
00:34:02,175 --> 00:34:03,495
why i think it was such a

1026
00:34:03,495 --> 00:34:04,995
pic with noise that i feel like

1027
00:34:05,025 --> 00:34:06,375
it was it was a huge deal

1028
00:34:06,375 --> 00:34:08,475
because these books were these books were

1029
00:34:08,475 --> 00:34:10,875
like a huge thing and so the

1030
00:34:11,025 --> 00:34:14,205
the first movie adaptation there's big controversy

1031
00:34:14,205 --> 00:34:16,155
about tom cruise being cast and all

1032
00:34:16,155 --> 00:34:18,105
that shit and oh so that's such

1033
00:34:18,105 --> 00:34:18,525
a modern

1034
00:34:18,825 --> 00:34:20,265
er yes but when you watch it

1035
00:34:20,265 --> 00:34:22,095
now it's terrible okay yeah i would

1036
00:34:22,095 --> 00:34:23,775
yeah people that said that was bad

1037
00:34:23,775 --> 00:34:25,215
idea but right good call on the

1038
00:34:25,215 --> 00:34:26,685
money yeah i would play jesus of

i'd agree that's what i'd be oh

1042
00:34:32,685 --> 00:34:34,845
