00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,360
darkness on the edge of town the

116
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:39,300
album cover can picture it i also

117
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,160
feel that the upstate it was more

118
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:43,800
narrow and that the rooms were like

119
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:45,270
tightly connected

120
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,940
you're describing a row home okay which

121
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:50,820
we did not have we lived in

122
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:53,400
an area that had more space a

123
00:04:53,409 --> 00:04:55,410
neighbor called mount airy and so we'd

124
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:56,640
like we had a yard and stuff

125
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:57,150
haha

126
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,580
yeah i really got a sense of

127
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:00,210
that house

128
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:05,070
he got blind picking blinds and wallpaper

129
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:05,970
what else do you need to do

130
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,400
i remember we did have blinds in

131
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,660
one room when i was very little

132
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:11,430
i remember we had the old-fashioned venetian

133
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,100
blinds yeah um but like those always

134
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:16,650
have bent they always got bent and

135
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,020
i remember they fell were like we

136
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:21,030
were fucking around and they fell off

137
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:22,080
that so like paul

138
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,930
oh and they cut my cousin's arm

139
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:27,990
off off yeah completely wow just for

140
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,690
minibike yeah maybe not many blinds venetian

141
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:34,710
blinds oh yeah dance now um we

142
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:36,150
so it was a it was an

143
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:39,960
old stone house and there were floors

144
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:42,180
it was three floors oh it was

145
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,070
three floors we've got to be my

146
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:46,806
old memory that you've erased now when

147
00:05:46,806 --> 00:05:48,180
i did picture there being three fours

148
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:50,610
because i was picturing a tall thin

149
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,520
how did i erase that memory because

150
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,870
you just said it wasn't a row

151
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:56,010
home and i guess it's been worth

152
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:58,350
three floors like now i'm imagined i'd

153
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:00,270
change the shape of the house the

154
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:01,950
house now you can stretch the house

155
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:05,700

156
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:09,390

00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:26,880
what i found funny when we watch

197
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,130

198
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:31,020
looking at him all the time just

199
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:32,730
being like usually they were live in

200
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:33,982
laugh track and i was while i

201
00:07:33,982 --> 00:07:35,760
was going like is this something okay

202
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:36,810

203
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:38,550
and what about the things you were

204
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:40,770
doing no no no just to be

205
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:43,590
like yep he was on the simpsons

206
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:45,450
it was probably funny yeah but like

207
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:46,860
i probably didn't get it right

208
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:50,310
yeah i remember laughing at steve martin

209
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:52,260
albums that i've for sure if there

210
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:53,010
was a lot of stuff i didn't

211
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:54,270
understand i mean yeah a lot of

212
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:55,620
it was great for kids because he

213
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,300
was just silly yeah but then there

214
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:59,550
were there were sometimes some jokes that

215
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:00,480
you had to be a grown up

216
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,800
together but i was still like the

217
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:04,800
grass oh yeah i remember my sister

218
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:07,860
for my birthday one year my sister

219
00:08:08,164 --> 00:08:09,240
was gonna buy me a gift and

220
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,770
i said i want cruel shoes by

221
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:14,280
steve martin the book yes and she

222
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,720
did not want to buy it for

223
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,730
me because she thought you're not you're

224
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:18,810
too young you're not going to get

225
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:20,970
it and i was like i'm going

226
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:23,010
to get it yeah and then i

227
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,060
of course i read and i loved

228
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:26,100
it my name guy yeah still i

229
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:28,260
loved it i think it can be

230
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,150
aspirational when you don't get something like

231
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:31,200
i want to get that so i'll

232
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,870
go investigated and figured out exactly i've

233
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:34,950
told this story i'm sure but when

234
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:36,300
i was in seventh grade i was

235
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,460
reading jerry seinfeld's book signings and i'm

236
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:38,640
like

237
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:43,230
yeah i gave it to my funny

238
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:45,240
science teacher who i thought i had

239
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,590
a crush and i'm kind of probably

240
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:49,260
but i was like kill like this

241
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:50,670
because he's so funny and then he

242
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,350
never gave it back and i owe

243
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:54,330
many you owning two i was in

244
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:55,860
my mind i was loaning it oh

245
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:57,180
but you never said but i was

246
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,830
sure i wasn't clear at all about

247
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:00,000
how i handed over

248
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:04,410
this right the dude fell that i

249
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:05,670
think that happens to everybody at some

250
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:07,980
point where you loan something to someone

251
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,000
and they do not realize it's a

252
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,460
loner yeah they just keep it why

253
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,480
you know what i don't like those

254
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:14,160
when people loaned me books that i

255
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,930
didn't ask to read i this is

256
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:17,310
how yeah that's a different thing i

257
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:19,710
