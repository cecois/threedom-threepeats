add to cart has changed lions it's

73
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:46,920
really thinking with add to cart yeah

74
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:49,980
i recently was recommended on add to

75
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:50,370
cart

76
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:54,300
some charcoal toothpaste and i and and

77
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,280
i asked the question my wife and

78
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,480
i me and my wife both asked

79
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,070
the question does it taste like charcoal

80
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:01,110
and the host of the show one

81
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:02,070
of the hosts of the show said

82
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:03,780

84
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,800
lot and let me tell you something

85
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,200
i order that jungle and it tastes

86
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:10,560
like fuck

87
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,320
even charcoal that's so gross so we're

88
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,120
like the anti add to cart were

89
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:16,950
removed from cart but here's the thing

90
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:19,170
it's very effective it is effective like

91
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:20,490
i've noticed this is a podcast where

92
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:21,840
we listened to add to cart and

93
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,130
talk shit about the things that they

94
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:25,170
want us to buy and we supply

95
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:26,460
them which i also did on add

96
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:30,060
to cart raw so yeah i learn

97
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:30,720
so

98
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:33,240
it tastes bad but it works tell

99
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,940
me it's it's a whitening toothpaste and

100
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,800
light it's black how can it wait

101
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,621
i know it's it's a conundrum as

102
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:43,830
it's a toothpaste conundrum to my caught

103
00:03:43,838 --> 00:03:45,930
on drum i know do another two

104
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:48,180
boys conundrum but it really it really

105
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:50,130
does it has made a difference then

106
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:50,730
i heard

107
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:53,010
that is actually dentist do not recommend

108
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:55,320
to use charcoal toothpastes so i figure

109
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,970
i'm going to use it until my

110
00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:00,240
upcoming dental appointment next month and then

111
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:01,740
pretend i haven't been using it

112
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,130
is this your dentist pride because you

113
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:06,270
want to know just to be proud

114
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:07,350
of you and how white your teeth

115
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:09,120
i need the dentist to be proud

116
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:11,040
i look i really did not i

117
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,830
did the the minimum dental care during

118
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:15,090
quarantine so did i and by the

119
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:16,200
way i went for the first time

and almost two years because of quarantine

121
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:20,940
yeah and i was just like alright

122
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,530
let's do this what's going on

124
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,870

00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:35,310
more frequently y mucho even during quarantine

128
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:37,560
i i just i took the chance

129
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,050
and dentists because i chose to change

130
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:42,510
but because i already had my eyes

131
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:43,200
open there

132
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:44,820

00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:46,740
know that's it's pretty nice yeah that's

134
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:48,300
the place to get it that's the

135
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:49,770
big that's the biggest place you can

136
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:50,880
get it is when your mouth is

137
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,950
open i know but in the little

138
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:55,440
cove perhaps can get there with pregnancy

my gums have gotten very inflamed which

140
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:59,820

my gums with this little gum pusher

162
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:52,530

164
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,730
i was trying to post a floss

165
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:58,650
to to where it does hurt because

166
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:01,020
that's what activates the gums i know

167
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,460
but i it's like it's gone to

168
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:02,640
pay

169
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:06,000
painful yeah we're talking about you're not

170
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,650
supposed to just floss to get rid

171
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:09,210
of food in between you need to

172
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:11,040
go up but taste wow up and

173
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:12,600
into the gum and try to like

174
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,940
make it hurt almost no data it

175
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:16,770
activates the gums no i agree i

176
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:18,780
really feel like i've lost i lost

177
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:20,520
a lot because ever since i didn't

178
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,800
invisalign looking for additional description

179
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,730
of this episode by the way

180
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:26,940
well i used to not really know

181
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,620
us and then once i didn't fizzle

182
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:30,300
and you have to floss invisalign or

183
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,460
it's really gross right and so i

184
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:33,660
was flossing all the time and now

185
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,700
it's a habit but i really hate

186
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,890
it when you actually get up in

187
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:39,120
between the gums how they do it

204

things i refuse to do that scott

205
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,730
wants me to do looks get seen

206
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:24,150
yeah yeah um when when you said

207
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:24,990
we had a lot to talk about

208
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:27,185
laura and this is it nones and

209
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:28,230
i'll tell ya that no

210
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,000
that's the main thing yeah we had

211
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,560
a ton to get into the gnomes

212
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:35,550
when we think flossing gnomes ah flossing

213
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:39,150
flossing nones yeah yes that's it so

214
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:41,040
say yeah right before we start the

215
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,270
show lowers like we got a lot

216
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:44,370
to talk about yeah lost immediately into

217
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:46,200
the gnomes which lead us i thought

218
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,850
the gnomes might be a bigger topic

219
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:48,330
for you guys

220
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,110
want to move on

221
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,820
since then that happened months ago when

222
00:07:53,834 --> 00:07:54,600
this drops

223
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:58,170
the thing hey you bought oh my

224
00:07:58,170 --> 00:08:00,420
god everyone shut

225
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:03,900
well one of my fears about the

226
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,340
gnome is that people aren't going to

227
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:06,690
buy it because it says it needs

228
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:07,800
to be shipped with a thirty five

229
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,780
dollar order because it's you know i

230
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:10,980
don't know why is it less than

231
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:12,390
thirty five dollars i find that hard

232
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:15,090
to believe that gnome is eight fifty

233
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:17,400
that's very reasonable is that the sale

234
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,690
price or is that regulates the sale

235
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:20,910
price ten dollars is regular and they

236
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:21,570
also had nine

237
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:23,580
they have a nine incher now good

238
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:24,900
for you guys oh but not on

239
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,100
the do on the website description it

240
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:28,230
says you could choose between seven feet

241
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:30,420
and nine feet they used the wrong

242
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:32,880
indicator oh i love it so much

243
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,470

to fix something or you know directv

343
00:12:13,975 --> 00:12:15,265
or whatever and the dog

344
00:12:15,265 --> 00:12:16,765
dogs are barking and i would say

345
00:12:16,765 --> 00:12:18,625
not ninety percent of the time they're

346
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:19,765
so nice about it they're like oh

347
00:12:19,765 --> 00:12:22,135

348
00:12:22,135 --> 00:12:24,208

i think with dogs you just have

353
00:12:29,995 --> 00:12:31,285
to ignore them for the most part

354
00:12:31,285 --> 00:12:34,555
unless they're particularly gnarly vicious okay so

355
00:12:34,555 --> 00:12:35,395
tell us what hap i would

356
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:38,665

a lot of dogs and even if

364
00:12:48,595 --> 00:12:50,725

there we we found there is a

368
00:13:00,895 --> 00:13:04,375
gap in between our backyard fence and

369
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:06,205
the neighbor's backyard well that's convenient for

370
00:13:06,205 --> 00:13:06,685

373
00:13:12,115 --> 00:13:14,185
thing is so crazy have we talked

374
00:13:14,185 --> 00:13:15,235
about she has like a mall in

375
00:13:15,235 --> 00:13:18,265
her basement shout em all interfaces isn't

376
00:13:18,955 --> 00:13:20,365
well it's like it's like she wasn't

377
00:13:20,365 --> 00:13:22,765
basemap a mall but it's not really

378
00:13:22,825 --> 00:13:23,845
a that at that point it's not

379
00:13:23,845 --> 00:13:25,135
a basement if you have a mall

380
00:13:25,195 --> 00:13:26,005
do you know what i think we

381
00:13:26,005 --> 00:13:27,955
talked about this ten hour

382
00:13:28,285 --> 00:13:30,085
ten hundred years ago to go yeah

383
00:13:30,505 --> 00:13:31,945
but it was when i went to

384
00:13:31,945 --> 00:13:34,255
versailles they said marie antoinette also had

385
00:13:34,255 --> 00:13:36,325
the same kind of was a marie-antoinette

386
00:13:36,355 --> 00:13:37,705
have the same kind of thing where

387
00:13:37,885 --> 00:13:39,805
branching out and take your age yeah

388
00:13:39,835 --> 00:13:41,035
she had a fake so people would

389
00:13:41,485 --> 00:13:43,285
act weird around her so that she

390
00:13:43,285 --> 00:13:44,815
could just stroll through and everyone was

391
00:13:44,815 --> 00:13:46,105
told to ignore her and that's the

392
00:13:46,105 --> 00:13:47,605
same thing that barbra streisand had and

393
00:13:47,605 --> 00:13:48,019
the like

394
00:13:48,145 --> 00:13:51,745
that is actually crazier like it's like

395
00:13:51,745 --> 00:13:54,025
i'd be thinking everyone here is pretending

396
00:13:54,025 --> 00:13:55,765
they don't see me how often did

397
00:13:55,765 --> 00:13:57,685
barbara streisand go to the mall before

398
00:13:57,685 --> 00:13:59,245
she got famous and did she have

399
00:13:59,245 --> 00:14:01,015
to buy things there in the mall

400
00:14:01,015 --> 00:14:02,875

get lacoste polos and a little boys

458
00:16:03,265 --> 00:16:05,725

00:16:06,535 --> 00:16:09,895
when i was young twelve lacrosse that's

460
00:16:09,895 --> 00:16:13,045
when the lacoste started it's sort of

461
00:16:13,045 --> 00:16:15,175
thing and it was super popular and

462
00:16:15,175 --> 00:16:17,395
everyone had everyone in my school dress

463
00:16:17,395 --> 00:16:20,815
like a preppy with lacoste t-shirts are

464
00:16:20,815 --> 00:16:22,945

00:16:22,945 --> 00:16:24,715
it with a the collars turned up

466
00:16:24,715 --> 00:16:25,975
and all that kind of stuff and

467
00:16:25,975 --> 00:16:26,515
so when i

468
00:16:26,545 --> 00:16:27,955
went to new york for my first

469
00:16:27,955 --> 00:16:29,365
big like family trip there was a

470
00:16:29,365 --> 00:16:32,695
guy selling a white lacoste sweater on

471
00:16:32,695 --> 00:16:33,805
a street corner and i think it

472
00:16:33,805 --> 00:16:35,635
was five dollars and i had like

473
00:16:35,635 --> 00:16:37,195
maybe ten dollars that my parents had

474
00:16:37,195 --> 00:16:38,485
given me to spend in new york

475
00:16:38,485 --> 00:16:40,555
and i i spent the five dollars

476
00:16:40,555 --> 00:16:42,205
on this white they gave you a

477
00:16:42,205 --> 00:16:44,995
ten to spend to do your good

478
00:16:44,995 --> 00:16:46,705

479
00:16:46,765 --> 00:16:49,015

480
00:16:49,015 --> 00:16:50,482

it on this white lacoste sweater and

484
00:16:57,492 --> 00:16:58,675

00:16:58,795 --> 00:17:01,075
um oh you think the thing they

486
00:17:01,075 --> 00:17:02,215

487
00:17:02,215 --> 00:17:02,635
fake

488
00:17:03,745 --> 00:17:05,365
making the cost for five dollars was

489
00:17:05,365 --> 00:17:07,075
not real i don't think cos just

490
00:17:07,075 --> 00:17:08,118
had too much they didn't even have

491
00:17:08,147 --> 00:17:09,115
room in their store and they like

492
00:17:09,115 --> 00:17:09,955
go out on the street and sell

493
00:17:09,973 --> 00:17:10,315
stuff

494
00:17:11,665 --> 00:17:13,765

00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:35,270
symptoms for like three days so i

657
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:38,090
was like expecting something in there from

658
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:40,340
the week aquaman jesus right if you

659
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:41,120

eagles you can or cannot get the

661
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:47,450
vaccine question i'm not a doctor i

662
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:49,520
think that you can because i think

663
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,620
that the it's like a thing that

664
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:53,900
you get every ten years a year

665
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,430
yeah yeah yeah so if you had

666
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:57,260
shingles well this i don't even want

667
00:22:57,260 --> 00:23:00,410

00:32:16,655 --> 00:32:19,535
moment was like jaw and and she

927
00:32:19,535 --> 00:32:21,395
ran and she was just like squeaking

928
00:32:21,395 --> 00:32:23,885
the toy let's play with ray like

929
00:32:23,885 --> 00:32:23,975
that

930
00:32:23,975 --> 00:32:26,075
it's why going back so she's like

931
00:32:26,105 --> 00:32:28,295
that's so great yeah really focused on

932
00:32:28,295 --> 00:32:29,645
the toy so we shut the gate

933
00:32:30,005 --> 00:32:32,882
shut again and we clean lock the

934
00:32:32,882 --> 00:32:34,415
gates as a matter of fact and

935
00:32:34,415 --> 00:32:36,965
um alright i was like just been

936
00:32:36,965 --> 00:32:38,405
here the whole time what is going

937
00:32:38,405 --> 00:32:40,985
on and we checked our camera and

938
00:32:41,135 --> 00:32:42,605
it's really cute we have like two

939
00:32:42,605 --> 00:32:43,835
cameras on it you can see her

940
00:32:43,835 --> 00:32:44,084
just

941
00:32:44,135 --> 00:32:47,465
like run into the into the the

942
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:49,835
backyard and like try to find me

943
00:32:50,225 --> 00:32:52,085
oh because you are gone away and

944
00:32:52,085 --> 00:32:53,555
she's like jumping up and trying to

945
00:32:53,555 --> 00:32:55,175
find me and then she finally sees

946
00:32:55,175 --> 00:32:57,875
me um but yeah so our our

947
00:32:57,875 --> 00:33:01,955
theory is that i guess dogs when

948
00:33:01,955 --> 00:33:03,575
they get lost and they can't figure

949
00:33:03,575 --> 00:33:04,295
out where they are

950
00:33:04,325 --> 00:33:06,035
are they just sort of hunker down

951
00:33:06,035 --> 00:33:08,311
and hide yeah in a place know

952
00:33:08,311 --> 00:33:09,725
i think i took a look at

953
00:33:09,725 --> 00:33:11,225
the camera and it looks like she

954
00:33:11,225 --> 00:33:12,725
came from up the street which only

955
00:33:12,725 --> 00:33:14,495
has like five houses up the street

956
00:33:14,525 --> 00:33:15,875
up the hill and i think she

957
00:33:15,875 --> 00:33:18,185
just wandered into the backyard of one

958
00:33:18,185 --> 00:33:19,685
of them and then couldn't fit in

959
00:33:19,895 --> 00:33:21,515
and probably when we were calling her

960
00:33:21,515 --> 00:33:23,015
was yelping like i can't figure out

961
00:33:23,015 --> 00:33:24,455
how to get out yeah

962
00:33:24,755 --> 00:33:26,915
and there's definitely i was just squeaking

963
00:33:26,915 --> 00:33:28,715
it so much she'd like was going

964
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:31,715
crazy ones like backend die and figured

965
00:33:31,729 --> 00:33:33,853
away out and just like smashed girl

966
00:33:33,853 --> 00:33:34,235

00:33:35,075 --> 00:33:37,565
like many time my cat has gotten

968
00:33:37,565 --> 00:33:40,865
out she's always been really close by

969
00:33:40,925 --> 00:33:42,545
like yeah you don't run you don't

970
00:33:42,545 --> 00:33:44,195
know but like then once you find

971
00:33:44,195 --> 00:33:45,785
them like she's she'll just be hiding

972
00:33:45,785 --> 00:33:47,345
in a bush like next door or

973
00:33:47,345 --> 00:33:49,925

974
00:33:49,925 --> 00:33:52,265

975
00:33:52,565 --> 00:33:53,885
recently it happened and she was in

00:33:53,885 --> 00:33:54,935
the backyard but it freaked

977
00:33:54,965 --> 00:33:56,495
me out so much because i was

978
00:33:56,495 --> 00:33:58,295

camera and she appeared to be coming

984
00:34:07,115 --> 00:34:09,575
from uphill just down the hills where

985
00:34:09,575 --> 00:34:10,895

into the neighborhood and was gone and

1063
00:36:24,695 --> 00:36:27,005

00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:53,900
that out there this is

1288
00:43:54,290 --> 00:43:55,640
for a gift this is my add

1289
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:57,650
to cart honestly so then on add

1290
00:43:57,650 --> 00:43:58,850
to cart they should talk about why

1291
00:43:58,850 --> 00:44:01,040
crack pies are bad okay great that

1292
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:03,230
would be great to restore balance in

1293
00:44:03,230 --> 00:44:05,300
the universe but i sent one to

1294
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:07,340
my dad for father's day sam which

1295
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:08,900
has my home so i'm really curious

1296
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:09,980
if he's gonna like it but i

1297
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:11,210
think that's going to be exciting because

1298
00:44:11,210 --> 00:44:13,550
it's shaped like a thai yeah because

1299
00:44:13,550 --> 00:44:13,970
you know what

1300
00:44:14,364 --> 00:44:15,408
you know what i'm so sick of

1301
00:44:15,408 --> 00:44:18,380
that shit of the eighteen father's day

1302
00:44:18,410 --> 00:44:19,910
cards are kind of hard to buy

1303
00:44:19,910 --> 00:44:21,620
because they all kind of assume you

1304
00:44:21,620 --> 00:44:22,970
have a relationship with your dad were

1305
00:44:22,970 --> 00:44:24,560
young guns tools

1306
00:44:25,580 --> 00:44:28,220
right right right that they all they

1307
00:44:28,220 --> 00:44:29,810
all are sort of like hey thanks

1308
00:44:29,810 --> 00:44:31,310
dad when that might not be the

1309
00:44:31,310 --> 00:44:33,560
sentiment i know there's there's never like

1310
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:36,500
a neutral enough tar and happy father's

1311
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:36,740
day

1312
00:44:38,690 --> 00:44:40,460

1316
00:44:50,330 --> 00:44:51,530

00:44:51,860 --> 00:44:53,390

1318
00:44:53,390 --> 00:44:55,280
that crack pie if you really yes

1319
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:57,290
and it's so good it's so um

1320
00:44:57,470 --> 00:44:58,490
i have a question what do you

1322
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:01,100
to appreciate them

1323
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:04,850

um i could now i have one

1336
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:38,810

1337
00:45:38,870 --> 00:45:40,400

1339
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:44,030
dad and he used it as his

1340
00:45:44,030 --> 00:45:46,820
briefcase for years that's actually not okay

1341
00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:49,730
memorization start to pass on like crew

1342
00:45:49,730 --> 00:45:51,530
gifts to your parents because they'll actually

1343
00:45:51,530 --> 00:45:52,940
be proud of it like yeah for

1344
00:45:52,940 --> 00:45:54,680
the between two ferns one deputy had

1345
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:57,980
the we had this public access logo

1346
00:45:57,980 --> 00:45:59,240
on it which doesn't mean anything to

1347
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:01,400
anyone and then netflix insisted on putting

1348
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:01,580
net

1349
00:46:01,610 --> 00:46:02,900
flicks on it and so we have

1350
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:04,910
them ah we haven't put it under

1351
00:46:04,910 --> 00:46:06,440
the back hood i was glad about

1352
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:08,210
that because sometimes it's so hard to

1353
00:46:08,210 --> 00:46:09,800
wear those things when they're really corny

1354
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:11,570
because it says like like i worked

1355
00:46:11,570 --> 00:46:13,880
really big yeah when you're walking around

1356
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,480
yeah exactly um i like to give

1357
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:19,220
people i like to send flowers i

1358
00:46:19,220 --> 00:46:20,900
think flowers are nice if sent my

1359
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:21,740
mom now says

1360
00:46:21,740 --> 00:46:23,270
i don't ever send me flowers again

1361
00:46:23,660 --> 00:46:26,390
why because she just doesn't like her

1362
00:46:26,390 --> 00:46:27,830
it's too much work or whatever she's

1363
00:46:27,830 --> 00:46:29,480
just like look you've been sending me

1364
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:31,100
flowers just don't send him to me

1365
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:32,810
ever again i think sending flowers is

1366
00:46:32,810 --> 00:46:35,000
actually so nice i might cost a

1367
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,040
little bit opposed to it at first

1368
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:38,145
when i when i did it like

1369
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:39,860
one of the first few times and

1370
00:46:39,860 --> 00:46:41,390
then it's like i now i'm like

1371
00:46:41,390 --> 00:46:41,870
i don't care what

1372
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:43,460
anyone says it's a nice thing to

1373
00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:44,870
get like it's just like it's a

1374
00:46:44,870 --> 00:46:47,330
sunny day yeah i'm sure i would

1375
00:46:47,330 --> 00:46:49,190
listen i'll never send flowers to that

1376
00:46:49,190 --> 00:46:49,520
bitch

1377
00:46:50,750 --> 00:46:52,010
she's done one of those bitches

1378
00:46:53,180 --> 00:46:54,680
but it's it's it's nice because it's

1379
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:57,200
so easy like i think it's you

1380
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:58,880
can find there's always a coupon by

1381
00:46:58,880 --> 00:46:59,840
the way i mean this is my

1382
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:01,550
big thing with like anything like that

1383
00:47:01,550 --> 00:47:02,840
you gotta search for a coupon you

1384
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:04,220
can always get fifteen percent off at

1385
00:47:04,220 --> 00:47:05,960
least off of any i mean you

1386
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:08,000

ep pretty sure the test you had

1414
00:47:58,550 --> 00:47:59,990
the one the one i talks about

1415
00:47:59,990 --> 00:48:01,250
for when i had the the bladder

1416
00:48:01,250 --> 00:48:03,200
infection and you guys are having fun

1417

00:48:10,370 --> 00:48:14,450
sisto re three graham vcu g i

1422
00:48:14,450 --> 00:48:17,300
own it is it is unfortunately very

1423
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:18,920
common and horrible it's to check for

1424
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:20,720
urine backing up into the kidneys and

1425
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:22,460
the child has to pee in front

1426
00:48:22,460 --> 00:48:23,660
of strangers on a tape

1427
00:48:23,660 --> 00:48:26,060
gl oh now i remember that yeah

1428
00:48:26,060 --> 00:48:27,380
we were like you just spray it

1429
00:48:27,380 --> 00:48:28,400
all over the you spray it all

1430
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:29,600
over the place and she does this

1431
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:31,730
very common and and and that's what

1432
00:48:31,730 --> 00:48:33,440
it was so that's good to know

1433
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:35,390
thank you so much shows really wondered

1434
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:37,251
i just have that memory of having

1435
00:48:37,251 --> 00:48:38,300
to pee in front of everyone and

1436
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:39,830
not knowing why and they're like oh

1437
00:48:39,830 --> 00:48:41,000
it's just something you have to do

1438
00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:42,410
and so now i know i may

1439
00:48:42,410 --> 00:48:43,790
have to do it's coming of age

1440
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:44,900
it's good to know because i've become

1441
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:46,520
a child again when you when you're

1442
00:48:46,550 --> 00:48:48,560
dating everyone has to do this

1443
00:48:50,930 --> 00:48:53,660
okay go on about flowers i think

1444
00:48:53,660 --> 00:48:54,950
another thing is if you know people

1445
00:48:54,950 --> 00:48:56,540
that drink i think wine is a

1446
00:48:56,540 --> 00:48:59,930
good yeah yeah a bottle of scotch

1447
00:49:00,380 --> 00:49:03,650
i think like stealing the mail well

1448
00:49:03,650 --> 00:49:06,500
i mean here's the thing is it

1449
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:08,240
really the mail like when you say

1450
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:09,620
you got the pie in the mail

1451
00:49:09,620 --> 00:49:09,740

1452
00:49:09,740 --> 00:49:11,300
is it usbs or was it like

1453
00:49:11,300 --> 00:49:13,880
a delivery service it was males but

1454
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:16,460
it was really these new persons in

00:49:16,460 --> 00:49:18,440
the mail never get it mill far

1456
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:21,950

1457
00:49:21,950 --> 00:49:24,260
i send it anywhere yeah yeah but

1458
00:49:24,260 --> 00:49:26,240
but i mean i mean it's it's

1459
00:49:26,270 --> 00:49:27,980
but it's gotta be stored in some

1460
00:49:27,980 --> 00:49:29,750
sort of you have to eat it

1461
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:31,849
within like you have to put it

1462
00:49:31,849 --> 00:49:32,990
in the fridge put it in dry

1463
00:49:32,990 --> 00:49:35,300
ice right yeah yeah yeah right but

1464
00:49:35,586 --> 00:49:37,670

the blazing blazing hot sun lady sided

1721
01:00:22,715 --> 01:00:25,415

they kept singing that christmas song but

1752
01:01:42,895 --> 01:01:45,055
making up words to tell us what

1753
01:01:45,055 --> 01:01:45,715
they saw

1754
01:01:46,975 --> 01:01:51,145
ah city or city standing on a

1755
01:01:51,145 --> 01:01:55,105
hill and it's burning up and needs

1756
01:01:55,105 --> 01:01:59,455
water with some smoke that climbs through

1757
01:01:59,455 --> 01:02:01,514
the sky

1758
01:02:02,635 --> 01:02:05,395
boom boom boom boom boom

1759
01:02:06,595 --> 01:02:08,515
they kept walking knowing that they were

1760
01:02:08,515 --> 01:02:09,743
the only ones who could save this

1761
01:02:09,743 --> 01:02:11,845
city as clearly all the people had

1762
01:02:11,848 --> 01:02:12,415
fled

1763
01:02:14,125 --> 01:02:15,835
hey we gotta save the city no

1764
01:02:15,835 --> 01:02:18,385
one's around we got damage her firefighter

1765
01:02:18,385 --> 01:02:19,735
so this is a good plan yeah

1766
01:02:19,735 --> 01:02:20,785
we do it because we love it

1767
01:02:20,785 --> 01:02:23,095
not for the money yeah but they

1768
01:02:23,095 --> 01:02:24,535

professionals no one will hire

1772
01:02:32,665 --> 01:02:34,015
they thought now is a good time

1773
01:02:34,015 --> 01:02:36,055
to talk about their relationship a little

1774
01:02:36,055 --> 01:02:37,195

1775
01:02:37,195 --> 01:02:40,075
