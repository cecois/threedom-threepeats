163
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:19,530

every other minute just for different stuff

167
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:28,530

168
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:29,700
yeah i take them over to say

169
00:06:29,703 --> 00:06:31,050
oh yeah every couple of seconds i'll

170
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:33,240

172
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:39,990

174
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:42,990

they were like cutting to all these

180
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:57,239
different locations and so the moment of

181
00:06:57,239 --> 00:07:00,090
silence happened and it was dead silent

182
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:02,040
like all good thing because that would

183
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,360

very funny ah nice i really do

248
00:09:31,798 --> 00:09:33,090
doubt that we are a little when

249
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:35,190
i was little i remember doing like

250
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,480
groucho marx

251
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:40,590
wow roadshow really as he talked where

252
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:41,220
forever

253
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:44,336
yeah that's pretty much it yeah the

254
00:09:44,336 --> 00:09:46,470
most ridiculous thing i ever say the

255
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:47,609
sugar boy now one hundred and eighty

256
00:09:47,609 --> 00:09:49,740
yeah um but i i remember my

257
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:51,180
homes when they talk like a stupid

258
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:51,480
idiot

259
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:55,410
yeah see that's the key to impressions

260
00:09:55,503 --> 00:09:57,540
for five talks like a stupid idiot

261
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:00,180
on his office yeah i'm always impressed

262
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:01,290
when someone can do an impression of

263
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:03,120
someone who talks like a normal person

264
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,980
you know what i mean yeah yeah

265
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:06,090
and then you're like oh my god

266
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:08,280
yeah like realised that person has quirks

267
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,270
like there i think there are some

268
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:10,140
people where i'm like they don't really

269
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:11,250
have anything weird about that yeah well

270
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:12,240
you remember when peter

271
00:10:12,965 --> 00:10:15,245
did the alan alda impression oh my

272
00:10:15,245 --> 00:10:17,615
god so but bill window later yeah

273
00:10:17,645 --> 00:10:18,995
they both do great ones you're like

274
00:10:19,025 --> 00:10:20,495
oh i guess i never i just

275
00:10:20,495 --> 00:10:22,295
thought he talked like a normal regular

276
00:10:22,445 --> 00:10:24,275
guy or or how could you even

277
00:10:24,275 --> 00:10:26,315
imitate that and then yeah that's crazy

278
00:10:26,525 --> 00:10:29,495
you gotta seize on imperfections and exaggerate

279
00:10:29,495 --> 00:10:32,345
them yes and break someone down yep

280
00:10:32,585 --> 00:10:32,975

281
00:10:33,035 --> 00:10:34,985

having kitschy fun with it yeah it's

707
00:25:46,605 --> 00:25:48,765
mine but it's not mine it's a

708
00:25:48,795 --> 00:25:51,085
japanese reality show called

709
00:25:51,195 --> 00:25:53,925
terrace house how so it takes place

710
00:25:53,925 --> 00:25:55,995
in japan however it's landed on this

711
00:25:55,995 --> 00:25:56,265
something

712
00:25:57,915 --> 00:26:00,285
and it's amazing and it's this how

713
00:26:00,315 --> 00:26:03,045
it's basically like real real world meets

714
00:26:03,105 --> 00:26:05,379
big brother but there's no challenges and

715
00:26:05,379 --> 00:26:08,625
no like forced drama so there's three

716
00:26:08,685 --> 00:26:11,235
boys and three girls and they all

717
00:26:11,235 --> 00:26:12,885
are like um people who are perfect

718
00:26:12,885 --> 00:26:15,043
for fucking yeah i know incidents it

719
00:26:15,043 --> 00:26:17,565
does work out but se does

720
00:26:17,565 --> 00:26:19,305
it does put there but it's so

721
00:26:19,305 --> 00:26:21,195
fascinating because they're all people who have

722
00:26:21,225 --> 00:26:23,865
individual goals in their lives like they

723
00:26:23,865 --> 00:26:24,945
have different careers that there's like a

724
00:26:24,945 --> 00:26:25,995
guy i want to be in a

725
00:26:25,995 --> 00:26:28,575
house that's your goal yep

726
00:26:29,445 --> 00:26:31,215
asleep and i'm fucking hemphill i've only

727
00:26:31,215 --> 00:26:33,585
slept outside except for camping but they're

728
00:26:33,585 --> 00:26:35,295
like there's like a hatmaker like an

729
00:26:35,325 --> 00:26:36,945
architect and like different people they'll have

730
00:26:36,975 --> 00:26:40,155
makers she's great really the different somebody

731
00:26:40,155 --> 00:26:41,955
has to make the heads she's a

732
00:26:41,955 --> 00:26:42,555
designer

733
00:26:43,815 --> 00:26:45,645
and then when you're ready to leave

734
00:26:45,645 --> 00:26:46,575
when you feel like you've reached a

735
00:26:46,575 --> 00:26:48,285
goal of your or you're just done

736
00:26:48,285 --> 00:26:50,175
with the relationships there you just leave

737
00:26:50,175 --> 00:26:51,465
and they put a new person of

738
00:26:51,465 --> 00:26:53,205
that gender and wit so whenever you

739
00:26:53,205 --> 00:26:55,125
want to leave with me on whatever

740
00:26:55,125 --> 00:26:56,865

00:26:56,865 --> 00:26:58,395
those months yeah i would never work

742
00:26:58,395 --> 00:26:59,835
out in america as much of them

743
00:26:59,835 --> 00:27:01,335
wanna be there no no no time

744
00:27:01,335 --> 00:27:02,685
so much of it would never happen

745
00:27:02,685 --> 00:27:03,885
this way it's something else you say

746
00:27:03,915 --> 00:27:04,845
that made me think oh and the

747
00:27:04,845 --> 00:27:07,095
moment of silence because like there's so

748
00:27:07,095 --> 00:27:08,925
much about the culture that allows the

749
00:27:08,925 --> 00:27:10,605
show to work this way but like

750
00:27:11,115 --> 00:27:13,305
in america unlike real-world they have sex

751
00:27:13,305 --> 00:27:14,835
on the first five minutes like someone

752
00:27:14,835 --> 00:27:16,605
will be fucking this does not happen

753
00:27:16,605 --> 00:27:18,285
they have like courtship and then like

754
00:27:18,285 --> 00:27:20,445
maybe the like there was one couple

755
00:27:20,445 --> 00:27:22,185
that got together and like you learn

756
00:27:22,185 --> 00:27:23,835
later that they do have sex building

757
00:27:23,837 --> 00:27:23,985
out

758
00:27:24,045 --> 00:27:25,305
like a conversation that she had like

759
00:27:25,485 --> 00:27:27,045
about it or something and like they

760
00:27:27,045 --> 00:27:28,725
don't actually show all the drama always

761
00:27:28,755 --> 00:27:30,585
just like you'll see a conversation where

762
00:27:30,585 --> 00:27:31,965
like earlier you said something really rude

763
00:27:31,965 --> 00:27:33,015
to me and you won't have seen

764
00:27:33,015 --> 00:27:35,985
that and so it's like it's it's

765
00:27:35,985 --> 00:27:37,815
so good and then ensure they're just

766
00:27:37,875 --> 00:27:39,975
the cameras don't work sometimes they might

767
00:27:39,975 --> 00:27:42,075
not film everything but still like it's

768
00:27:42,105 --> 00:27:43,395
because i'm haven't figured that out yet

769
00:27:43,395 --> 00:27:44,205
if there's always a camera

770
00:27:44,235 --> 00:27:46,665
they're not but then there's these interstitials

771
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:49,155
with these comedians these japanese like celebrities

772
00:27:49,245 --> 00:27:50,595
oh and they make fun of the

773
00:27:50,595 --> 00:27:51,495
show and they make fun of all

774
00:27:51,495 --> 00:27:53,090
the people and it's so i'm gonna

775
00:27:53,090 --> 00:27:56,715
choke so funny it's like you're choking

776
00:27:56,715 --> 00:27:58,095
because it's so funny yeah i can't

777
00:27:58,095 --> 00:28:00,045
believe it no when i think when

778
00:28:00,045 --> 00:28:01,695
i watch though it's so fascinating because

779
00:28:01,695 --> 00:28:03,405
it feels like us hanging out like

780
00:28:03,435 --> 00:28:04,365
how we would make fun

781
00:28:04,365 --> 00:28:05,775
none of them like it really opened

782
00:28:05,775 --> 00:28:08,265
my eyes up so much like culturally

783
00:28:08,295 --> 00:28:09,705
like i i've been to tokyo and

784
00:28:09,705 --> 00:28:10,725
i loved it there so much but

785
00:28:10,935 --> 00:28:13,035
you can't communicate at a certain point

786
00:28:13,035 --> 00:28:14,745
obviously i don't speak the language and

787
00:28:14,745 --> 00:28:16,335
to hear them like joking the exact

788
00:28:16,335 --> 00:28:17,355
same way that we joke i was

789
00:28:17,355 --> 00:28:18,735
like this is so cool it's just

790
00:28:18,735 --> 00:28:20,745
awesome i think you would really enjoy

791
00:28:20,775 --> 00:28:21,645

watching a different series of different girls

807
00:28:55,515 --> 00:28:58,305
who go watching bravo shows and commenting

808
00:28:58,305 --> 00:29:00,165
on them so you seeing it's basically

809
00:29:00,165 --> 00:29:01,485
just their commentary you stick a little

810
00:29:01,485 --> 00:29:02,715
clip and then make fun of it

811
00:29:02,715 --> 00:29:04,005
or something yeah and then we were

812
00:29:04,005 --> 00:29:05,115
gonna do a show where we come

813
00:29:05,115 --> 00:29:06,555
into on that that's almost like you're

814
00:29:06,555 --> 00:29:08,145
trapped in the closet commentary yes

815
00:29:08,205 --> 00:29:10,665
that's right that's right alright kelly did

816
00:29:10,725 --> 00:29:13,065
um ah you know the fast track

817
00:29:13,065 --> 00:29:14,925
to the closet and he did a

818
00:29:14,955 --> 00:29:17,535
of a visual commentary where he was

819
00:29:17,535 --> 00:29:19,755
watching unity it was his back and

820
00:29:19,755 --> 00:29:21,225
he was watching a tv screen then

821
00:29:21,225 --> 00:29:23,654
he would turn over the shoulder and

822
00:29:23,654 --> 00:29:25,725
he sat in awe like icy share

823
00:29:25,935 --> 00:29:27,255
it was the weirdest thing he's sitting

824
00:29:27,255 --> 00:29:28,365
like in three-quarter pro

825
00:29:28,395 --> 00:29:31,545
file with it with a screen you

826
00:29:31,545 --> 00:29:32,445
know in front of him and he's

827
00:29:32,445 --> 00:29:34,635
watching trapped in the closet and then

828
00:29:34,635 --> 00:29:37,335
he would um he would just pretty

829
00:29:37,335 --> 00:29:39,015
much say who'd watch this one was

830
00:29:39,015 --> 00:29:40,485
happening yeah and then he would just

831
00:29:40,485 --> 00:29:42,405
turn over a shoulder to the camera

832
00:29:42,405 --> 00:29:43,665
hygiene while he just look at the

833
00:29:43,665 --> 00:29:45,405
camera yeah so when i oh and

834
00:29:45,405 --> 00:29:46,995
i saw paul do this live he

835
00:29:46,995 --> 00:29:48,375
put that on the screen

836
00:29:48,555 --> 00:29:49,995
and sat with his back to the

837
00:29:49,995 --> 00:29:52,695
audience and then turned around and spoke

838
00:29:52,695 --> 00:29:55,965
overall funny i love that it is

839
00:29:55,965 --> 00:29:59,895
interesting like culturally other countries with people

840
00:29:59,895 --> 00:30:01,425
who don't want to constantly be on

841
00:30:01,425 --> 00:30:03,345
tv or just how much i remember

842
00:30:03,345 --> 00:30:06,135
i was watching ah in probably the

843
00:30:06,165 --> 00:30:07,815
early two thousands i was watching this

844
00:30:08,025 --> 00:30:08,685
nineteen sick

845
00:30:08,685 --> 00:30:10,305
sixty s episode of the dating game

846
00:30:10,545 --> 00:30:12,855
and just how different the united states

847
00:30:12,855 --> 00:30:15,975
is now ah this episode of the

848
00:30:15,975 --> 00:30:17,955
dating game the the woman it was

849
00:30:17,955 --> 00:30:19,485
three bachelors and a woman and the

850
00:30:19,485 --> 00:30:22,215
woman said to okay bachelor number three

851
00:30:22,545 --> 00:30:23,985
sing a song that you make up

852
00:30:23,985 --> 00:30:26,325
for me and that's a number three

853
00:30:26,325 --> 00:30:28,245
said um i don't think i would

854
00:30:28,245 --> 00:30:28,785
be able to do

855
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:31,150
and no thank you and she said

856
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:34,660
okay and then they moved on and

857
00:30:34,690 --> 00:30:36,820
i was like oh yeah of course

858
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:39,730
back then how demeaning to be on

859
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:44,530
television came now yeah well anyway ah

860
00:30:44,830 --> 00:30:46,480
all these things that had not been

861
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:48,550
invented yet all the tropes of television

862
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:49,570
and not been invented yet

863
00:30:49,810 --> 00:30:51,670
and there was still some ah you

864
00:30:51,670 --> 00:30:54,250
know like sheen of civility to everything

865
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:55,840
yeah well you you had to go

866
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:58,270
back to your neighborhood and friends and

867
00:30:58,270 --> 00:31:00,040
family and they would yeah make fun

868
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,150
of you if you did something like

869
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:02,500
that i'm not going to sing songs

870
00:31:02,650 --> 00:31:03,760
and nowadays it would be like i

871
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,710
saw you on television but i think

872
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:07,390
that is also what's kind of fascinating

873
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:08,830
thing about this show is that i

874
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:09,760
would assume

875
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:13,180
culturally they would not want to be

876
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:14,680
a part of something like that like

877
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,790
just out of like what i know

878
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:17,920
what the culture but then to see

879
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,660
how they handle it and how the

880
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:22,360
comedians like roast them and exactly i

881
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:23,440
mean the joe i mean when i

882
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,970
say like it i find that to

883
00:31:24,970 --> 00:31:27,490
the most fascinating thing because their their

884
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,590
culture meaning like the sense of humour

885
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:29,980
that they show

886
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:32,740
share is so exactly what we do

887
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:34,990
that it was like really eye opening

888
00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:36,100
when i felt like oh i feel

889
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:37,630
like i have these judgments about other

890
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:39,550
cultures or things that i think senses

891
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:42,520
of humor or they don't always lend

892
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:44,620
yeah one yeah remember when big brother

893
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:47,080
first came out here in the states

894
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:49,090
they included all this stuff that they

895
00:31:49,090 --> 00:31:50,140
would put on the ah

896
00:31:50,170 --> 00:31:51,340
i believe it was a swedish show

897
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:52,870
first and they they made all these

898
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:54,280
like jokes that they would make on

899
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:56,980
the swedish version that did not fly

900
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:59,380
with americans because you know we we

901
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:01,210
had had it was all this kind

902
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:02,680
of ironic stuff of like look we're

903
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:03,760
just going to show you the chicken

904
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:06,130
coop for a whole minute yes like

905
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:08,050
yeah we we've had lettermen for twenty

906
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:10,300
five years you know old iran

907
00:32:10,397 --> 00:32:12,280
just on big brother yeah the first

908
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:13,900
season they did it exactly like they

909
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:15,910
did the original swedish show and it

910
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:17,110
was not very good and then they

911
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:18,610
changed it to make an american job

912
00:32:18,910 --> 00:32:22,000
but you know american idol ah is

913
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,290
kind of the same thing when it

914
00:32:23,290 --> 00:32:26,260
was pop idol in the u k

915
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:27,970
they have the evil competed to be

916
00:32:27,970 --> 00:32:28,630
the next popeye

917
00:32:29,770 --> 00:32:32,110

918
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:32,950
boring papa

919
00:32:34,624 --> 00:32:37,870
okay okay but they they had two

920
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:40,510
comedians and compression you were waiting to

921
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:42,700

yeah yeah

926
00:32:51,130 --> 00:32:53,710
okay so when i was thirteen i

927
00:32:53,710 --> 00:32:56,470
lived here in california and i started

928
00:32:56,470 --> 00:32:58,600
listening to kiss fm right top forty

929
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:01,270
radio yeah and they had a ah

930
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:03,700
they had a district eon from i

931
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:06,220
believe six to ten was his slot

932
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:09,880
and his name is bruce vidal and

933
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:10,300
ah

934
00:33:10,484 --> 00:33:12,340
i thought he was so cool you

935
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:14,680
just sounded say his voice was very

936
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,930
very cool i remember like years later

937
00:33:16,930 --> 00:33:17,830
i saw a picture of him and

938
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:21,580
he was like giants like oh gosh

939
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:24,670
um not no judgments on that but

940
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:26,170
just now was not the mental image

941
00:33:26,185 --> 00:33:29,080
that i expected um and he would

942
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:30,430
do this thing called the boogie line

943
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:33,310
and where at about seven forty five

944
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:34,630
he would say the boogie line is

945
00:33:34,630 --> 00:33:36,970
now open and you would call the

946
00:33:36,970 --> 00:33:39,160
radio station and you would like tell

947
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:41,020
jokes on the air and and and

948
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:42,700
then out of around eight twenty or

949
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:45,100
something his team would edit them all

950
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:46,840
together and it would be like random

951
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:49,060
montage of people calling in until july

952
00:33:49,810 --> 00:33:51,370
so when i was thirteen i was

953
00:33:51,370 --> 00:33:52,870

to start unless everyone's there since i'm

1151
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:11,330
not guilty of a crime i reserve

1152
00:41:11,330 --> 00:41:12,800
the privilege to keep my own motives

1153
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:14,540
a matter of confidentiality

1154
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,270
you keep saying you're not guilty but

1155
00:41:17,270 --> 00:41:19,640

1156
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:21,050

to fuck with me i don't think

1161
00:41:26,030 --> 00:41:27,890
it's necessary to dehumanize a man to

1162
00:41:27,890 --> 00:41:29,390
get him to perform you can get

1163
00:41:29,390 --> 00:41:31,280
better results raising our spirits than lowering

1164
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,870
our dignity this is you can't turn

family of indians live there

1364
00:49:43,070 --> 00:49:45,380
a family of indians lived there i

1365
00:49:45,380 --> 00:49:47,870
mean i expected one or two but

1366
00:49:47,870 --> 00:49:50,000
a whole family that's incredible i don't

1367
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,890
see much of them you don't see

1368
00:49:51,890 --> 00:49:53,630
much of them though i mean ah

1369
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:56,360
that can be expected i mean you

1370
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:58,370
know they're not really known for hanging

1371
00:49:58,370 --> 00:49:59,090
out outside

1372
00:50:00,620 --> 00:50:01,160
shoes

1373
00:50:03,260 --> 00:50:05,300
well yeah because they don't have shoes

1374
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:06,920
normally so they they tend to stay

1375
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:10,190
inside and because they can get rocks

1376
00:50:10,190 --> 00:50:11,390
in their feet and it's just very

1377
00:50:11,390 --> 00:50:13,880
difficult so i it's very understandable so

1378
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:15,290
i get it where

1379
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:20,750
at their houses obviously ah so no

1380
00:50:20,750 --> 00:50:22,010
i get it's there's no need to

1381
00:50:22,010 --> 00:50:25,010
be defensive about not seeing your neighbors

1382
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:26,900
i understand because you know i don't

1383
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:27,980
talk to my neighbors all that much

1384
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:29,840
either so easy everyone tends to just

1385
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:31,640
stay inside you know i might have

1386
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:31,940
a pair

1387
00:50:33,770 --> 00:50:36,290
you yeah i mean you could definitely

1388
00:50:36,290 --> 00:50:37,700
get a pair of shoes i think

1389
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:39,920
it would be you would definitely protect

1390
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:41,150
your feet i mean i'm looking down

1391
00:50:41,150 --> 00:50:43,170

1392
00:50:43,170 --> 00:50:45,470
um you know really disgusting and you

1393
00:50:45,470 --> 00:50:47,060
