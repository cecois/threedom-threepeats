finger oh that's right now close your

247
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:50,970
seeing finger it's a riddle

00:08:53,946 --> 00:08:55,770
we both took pictures of lauryn dressed

249
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:58,620
as a cop i took one planning

250
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:00,390
on texting into the group chain yeah

253
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,710
picture to the group chain and i

254
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:09,150
immediately like oh yeah i took one

255
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:11,010
night and i sent mine and they

256
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:12,240
were the exact same

257
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,510
same second second of the show now

258
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:17,130
to be fair and janie thesis is

259
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:18,300
very weird she's like you took a

260
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:20,010
picture at the exact same time i'm

261
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:22,890
like the was short lauren was only

262
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:25,740
in thirty seconds yeah of the movie

263
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:27,600
like we picked one of those thirty

264
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:29,100
here's what it was and because this

265
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,180
is what i said to jamie

266
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:34,260
that it perfectly it was the perfect

267
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:38,490
amount of time together cameras noticing more

268
00:09:38,490 --> 00:09:40,230
and other shit yeah getting the phone

269
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:41,880
sending it updating the textures are yeah

270
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:43,530
like of course it's like i did

271
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:44,880
it immediately and i'm trying you didn't

272
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,290
i didn't really too yeah so it

273
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:47,370
only stands to reason it would be

274
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:49,890
that but janie was extremely amy thought

275
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:51,900
it was fishy as fuck yes she

276
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:53,700
did she was like you guys plan

277
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:54,930
this yeah i think

278
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,060
i don't know what to do or

279
00:09:57,060 --> 00:10:01,350
were impractical joe of all time um

280
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:03,420
but so so yeah you were still

281
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:05,014
a practical joke of all time was

282
00:10:05,014 --> 00:10:06,750
that comic city was nine eleven it

283
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:10,740
wasn't oh hey i didn't get that

284
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:12,360
i thought that was a weird joke

285
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:15,835
and anywhere else i think i think

286
00:10:15,835 --> 00:10:17,815
i've been twenty twenty i was in

287
00:10:17,815 --> 00:10:19,795
mexico when i was gone thanks to

288
00:10:19,795 --> 00:10:22,285
that one place and that's so that's

289
00:10:22,285 --> 00:10:23,755
a whole year and i also keep

290
00:10:23,755 --> 00:10:25,705
thinking december was just now like you

292
00:10:26,605 --> 00:10:28,975

314
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,805

325
00:11:36,835 --> 00:11:38,965

to tokyo again we wanted to go

327
00:11:40,165 --> 00:11:41,905

bunch of editors like one guy wrote

454

492
00:17:19,675 --> 00:17:20,935

all horse i can't remember exactly wow

498
00:17:35,245 --> 00:17:37,465
it breaks down but they all get

499
00:17:37,825 --> 00:17:40,675
out of focus for standing what's a

500
00:17:40,975 --> 00:17:43,405
good example if i remember it

501
00:17:43,435 --> 00:17:44,845
all cracks they have like a a

502
00:17:44,845 --> 00:17:46,435
meeting and they they all want a

503
00:17:46,465 --> 00:17:48,565
meeting some kind of make a plan

504
00:17:48,565 --> 00:17:49,705

506
00:17:51,895 --> 00:17:54,145

hitting cameras in the stable

00:18:00,265 --> 00:18:01,075
so the horse didn't know

511
00:18:03,955 --> 00:18:04,765
and at the end they were going

512
00:18:04,765 --> 00:18:06,115
to be like see there's a camera

513
00:18:06,115 --> 00:18:07,465

599
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:02,330
the peacemaker the patch maker the mover

600
00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:04,820
forward this is not as cool the

601
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:05,870
pieces when i said that was a

602
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:06,201
shark

603
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:07,850
yeah that sounds right the patch but

604
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:10,820
the mena togo okay i'll be the

605
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:15,470
midnight or dust shark but i'm saying

606
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:17,810
that steph curry they couldn't the very

607
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:19,970
last day of filming covert happened so

608
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:21,830
they had to animate him for the

609
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:24,740
entire very live filming covert happened

610
00:21:25,843 --> 00:21:27,530
that was a weird day but what

611
00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:29,480
i but might to my larger point

612
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:32,180
paul i remember maybe animating things up

613
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:34,820
that morning they may be animating things

614
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:37,430
now because they can't film them know

615
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:38,930
you're not listening to me you're not

616
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:41,060
listening tiny which i think is your

617
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:43,310
steph curry story frankly it was a

618
00:21:43,310 --> 00:21:45,080
disaster okay

619
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,745
i thought it was the peacemaker with

620
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:50,120
her toys they have audio like old

621
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:52,190
tapes and things sure and they're just

622
00:21:52,599 --> 00:21:54,200
that there was never video for it

623
00:21:54,290 --> 00:21:56,390
okay and they're just animating these okay

624
00:21:56,450 --> 00:21:59,210
and what are they doing this this

625
00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:00,920

harry doyle sound like a mirror before

739
00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:12,440
notice during before and that is married

740
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:14,180
to many people in the genus know

741
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:15,200
i like to be in the nudd

742
00:26:18,290 --> 00:26:18,890
but but

743
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,880
i've never said it out loud so

744
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:24,170
if i say something

745
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:27,890
but i guess it is married before

746
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:29,120
is that's something that would be weird

747
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,920
if like oh yeah he was american

748
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,270
this you're married to my know what

749
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:33,980
a big mess is what i have

750
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:37,010
changed the fucking subject okay with you

751
00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:37,880
ma

752
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:42,290
when i'm going back to my original

753
00:26:42,386 --> 00:26:45,080
original question before you start doing bad

754
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:49,820
the secret would have to be something

755
00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:51,824
really something i wouldn't care about it

756
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:53,780
all because i think anything that is

757
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:55,550
like my lifestyle was this or whenever

758
00:26:55,550 --> 00:26:57,260
i go why have you never brought

759
00:26:57,260 --> 00:26:59,540
that up we've talked about every single

760
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:01,400
thing right and then you're gonna tell

761
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,350
me like how often this a question

762
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:04,490
for you guys since you've been married

763
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:06,320
moe long time how often

764
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,600
often do you have a new story

765
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:10,159
that you have or your spouse that

766
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:13,220
you like oh wow i feel like

767
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:14,870
it's so rare now yeah i mean

768
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:16,700
it's rare i'm we've mike and i

769
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:19,280
have been together like five years yeah

770
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:23,360
it's like it's it's ah rare condition

771
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,220
in this day and age to find

772
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:26,480
news especially spend

773
00:27:26,551 --> 00:27:28,400
so much time together now but i

774
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:29,660
but i feel like it just happened

775
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:31,640
recently where cool up is like deaf

776
00:27:31,644 --> 00:27:32,540
you ever done that and i said

777
00:27:32,570 --> 00:27:34,220
oh you know when i was especially

778
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:36,980
because i had you know forty years

779
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:38,570

781
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,340
lot of my time and come on

roadways even freaking bribery free

783
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:49,850
um i feel like a prompt will

784
00:27:49,850 --> 00:27:51,588
sometimes shake a story like that yeah

785
00:27:51,588 --> 00:27:54,020
yeah um but what's funny to me

786
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:57,440
is you're so used to hearing the

787
00:27:57,470 --> 00:27:58,790
other person we're so used to hearing

788
00:27:58,790 --> 00:28:01,400
each other stories told to a third

789
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:04,940
boss right yeah that it's like i

790
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:06,800
sort of enjoy that in a weird

791
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:09,230
way of like okay she's going to

792
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:11,660

00:28:14,210 --> 00:28:16,580
rebind at some point you know yeah

796
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:19,400
um i sort of like that that

797
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,830
routine that happened recently yeah we're talking

798
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:22,820
to i'm planning by the way about

799
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:23,900
not knowing a new story we were

800
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:26,600

801
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:29,000
the wife started telling a story and

802
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,730
the husband like kept interjecting going like

00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:35,720
about he he knew the story way

805
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,850
more he's like you're missing every point

806
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:40,310
it's important to it and she was

807
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:42,020
like well i'm just trying to stay

808
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:43,640
you know and and of course like

809
00:28:43,670 --> 00:28:45,560
everything all the details he added in

810
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:46,730

811
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,940

00:28:51,213 --> 00:28:53,930
always relied on the cognizant strangers i'm

813
00:28:53,930 --> 00:28:55,100
trying to keep a thought in my

814
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,930
head but it's not possible

815
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:00,740
um but no i mean yeah club

816
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:04,670
and i've been together or twenty one

817
00:29:04,670 --> 00:29:07,040
years i guess so yeah yeah wow

818
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:09,020
will be hard you've had most of

819
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:12,080
your lives together yeah shit man most

820
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:14,030
of hers mostly hers you've had most

821
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:15,590
of coop's life together i'm almost so

822
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:17,360
you know all of her yeah you

823
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,230
might have some story

824
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:20,570
no honestly i was not interested in

825
00:29:20,570 --> 00:29:22,587
anything she was talking about okay so

826
00:29:22,587 --> 00:29:24,230
the first fifteen years you didn't hear

827
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:25,970
a word no but i mean there's

828
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:27,230
your busy talking i think it would

829
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:29,000
happen it would definitely have to be

830
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,470
well there's two categories that would have

831
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:32,060
to be stories before we met each

832
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:35,480
other but also stories that were told

833
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:37,458
early on in our relationship that we've

834
00:29:37,458 --> 00:29:38,420
forgotten yeah like so

835
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,850
every once in a while i'll timidly

836
00:29:40,850 --> 00:29:42,320
say hey could you remind me of

837
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,190
the story because i

838
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:46,850
i guess i in previous please say

839
00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:49,700
these lore stories no but i guess

840
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:51,320
maybe in previous relationships i would have

841
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:53,300
been lambasted for your not paying attention

842
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:54,380

00:32:40,465 --> 00:32:42,715
then i have all these like voiceover

923
00:32:42,715 --> 00:32:44,215
jobs and things that are very simple

924
00:32:44,215 --> 00:32:46,075
but it's like a kind of wig

925
00:32:46,195 --> 00:32:47,815
the pandemic makes it feels like it

926
00:32:47,815 --> 00:32:49,105
just fills your day if you have

927
00:32:49,105 --> 00:32:50,545
one where you have this like stress

928
00:32:50,545 --> 00:32:52,975
of weight everything should be shut down

929
00:32:52,975 --> 00:32:54,415
because we can't do anything but then

930
00:32:54,415 --> 00:32:56,725
you also have responsibilities yeah so you

931
00:32:56,725 --> 00:32:58,375
feel busier than ever but

932
00:32:58,375 --> 00:33:01,705
but you also feel like the stress

933
00:33:01,735 --> 00:33:03,775
of not being able to do anything

934
00:33:03,835 --> 00:33:05,545
means that you shouldn't just do anything

935
00:33:05,545 --> 00:33:06,595

1119
00:39:25,315 --> 00:39:26,695
have to watch it a bunch of

1120
00:39:26,695 --> 00:39:26,935
times

1121
00:39:26,965 --> 00:39:28,795
to see when the job happens wow

1122
00:39:28,795 --> 00:39:31,285

1123
00:39:31,285 --> 00:39:32,935

00:39:32,935 --> 00:39:33,985
makes you kind of go well you

1125
00:39:33,985 --> 00:39:35,695

1126
00:39:36,985 --> 00:39:38,995
if stopping babies exact don't fill it

1127
00:39:38,995 --> 00:39:40,555
up like it's gonna be bad like

1128
00:39:40,555 --> 00:39:42,322
just go yes just do it just

1129
00:39:42,573 --> 00:39:44,155
and so so i started to sort

1130
00:39:44,155 --> 00:39:45,205
of like go out and they had

1131
00:39:45,235 --> 00:39:47,275
they and like run out and go

1132
00:39:47,275 --> 00:39:49,315
get smelling salts and cool up within

1133
00:39:49,315 --> 00:39:51,355
the ruling source that happens if you

1134
00:39:51,355 --> 00:39:53,725
faint like wouldn't be okay while all

1135
00:39:53,725 --> 00:39:55,525
the color out of my facing thing

1136
00:39:55,525 --> 00:39:56,365
to yes

1137
00:39:56,995 --> 00:39:58,674
they fall asleep oh okay so something

1138
00:39:58,796 --> 00:40:00,925
doesn't do anything it is bad for

1139
00:40:00,925 --> 00:40:03,175
the process no that's safe maybe don't

1140
00:40:03,175 --> 00:40:04,795
think anyone ever wants anyone to fate

1141
00:40:04,855 --> 00:40:06,775
like probably bad for anyone to fei

1142
00:40:06,775 --> 00:40:09,145
mean it just feels like if you

1143
00:40:09,415 --> 00:40:11,305
already laying down and they're doing something

1144
00:40:11,305 --> 00:40:12,205
to you they'll just wait for you

1145
00:40:12,205 --> 00:40:13,285
to get back up but it's like

1146
00:40:13,855 --> 00:40:15,745

alice it was really scary to me

1188
00:41:41,690 --> 00:41:43,460
for a while then it became a

1189
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:44,930
little ridiculous when you realize like oh

1190
00:41:44,930 --> 00:41:46,820
this isn't going anywhere yeah exactly

1191
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:49,160

00:41:49,190 --> 00:41:50,480
got in the crib they didn't that's

1193
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,580

00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:53,930
didn't they didn't pay off no not

1195
00:41:53,930 --> 00:41:55,430
at all i thought it was a

1196
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:58,280
really interesting story but it started out

1197
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:00,170
scaring but it didn't just didn't it

1198
00:42:00,170 --> 00:42:01,850

1199
00:42:01,850 --> 00:42:04,520
another season there is this there should

1200
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:05,990
be a holy story there should be

1201
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:07,400

00:44:40,070 --> 00:44:41,930
things that you think might happen or

1289
00:44:41,930 --> 00:44:43,970
things that already did happen i used

to do it about things that i

1291
00:44:45,110 --> 00:44:46,940
thought might happen yeah like like if

1292
00:44:46,940 --> 00:44:48,470

00:44:48,470 --> 00:44:51,020
a friend this thing and yes exactly

1294
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:52,400
well what a piece of work is

1295
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:55,130
man yeah it's really a waste of

1296
00:44:55,190 --> 00:44:56,570
insulate waste of life to waste of

1297
00:44:56,780 --> 00:44:59,030
i really feel like and i talked

1298
00:44:59,060 --> 00:45:00,080
about it a lot but i'm really

1299
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:01,430
addicted to social media and i've been

1300
00:45:01,430 --> 00:45:03,320
thinking i really need to stop this

1301
00:45:03,530 --> 00:45:04,790
i would really like to spend my

1302
00:45:05,030 --> 00:45:09,650
my mind times doing something like my

1303
00:45:09,650 --> 00:45:12,590
mind literally like a moneybox

1304
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:15,830
many bucks are just wasting away hugs

1305
00:45:16,490 --> 00:45:17,030
i'm in my

1306
00:45:18,650 --> 00:45:20,120
but moneybox is a funny way to

1307
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:21,710
describe you get paid what we call

1308
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:22,250
buddy

1309
00:45:27,230 --> 00:45:29,150
but i find myself just going even

1310
00:45:29,150 --> 00:45:31,126
if i was just sitting here at

1311
00:45:31,126 --> 00:45:32,810
that would be better than this like

1312
00:45:32,810 --> 00:45:34,580
well i know i know things would

1313
00:45:34,580 --> 00:45:37,040
be better than this and then reading

1314
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:38,840
obviously would be better than that and

1315
00:45:38,990 --> 00:45:40,700
doing a task or a craft or

1316
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:42,440
learning like i was learning piano for

1317
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:43,610
like a couple of weeks lie

1318
00:45:43,610 --> 00:45:45,380
like oh later like i was supposed

1319
00:45:45,380 --> 00:45:46,670

1320
00:45:46,670 --> 00:45:48,618

00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:14,000
to adjust in our lives yeah in

1334
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,490
order and and you can think of

1335
00:46:16,490 --> 00:46:17,570
like whoa we're not going to be

1336
00:46:17,570 --> 00:46:19,940
able to to do as much work

1337
00:46:19,940 --> 00:46:20,690
or we're not gonna be able to

1338
00:46:20,690 --> 00:46:23,030
travel as much i said realistically honestly

1339
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:23,930
if we just

1340
00:46:23,930 --> 00:46:26,330
it stopped reading twitter i know it's

1341
00:46:26,330 --> 00:46:27,500
enough time to take care of it

1342
00:46:27,860 --> 00:46:30,680
oh yeah so think about that with

1343
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:32,360
like kids like i don't want to

1344
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:34,490
be on my phone all the time

1345
00:46:34,490 --> 00:46:36,410
yeah with my kids in the future

1346
00:46:36,410 --> 00:46:38,900
like and then thinking about people i

1347
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:41,690
follow who are always like storing their

1348
00:46:42,380 --> 00:46:44,090
their time with their kids

1349
00:46:44,090 --> 00:46:46,130
and i'm like stop like yeah i

1350
00:46:46,130 --> 00:46:46,879

1359
00:47:01,730 --> 00:47:02,840
like always doing this with their kids

1360
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:04,340

1362
00:47:05,690 --> 00:47:07,190

if one person has to explain the

1471
00:51:07,285 --> 00:51:09,145

1475
00:51:14,455 --> 00:51:15,805
burden is on the mutual friend to

1528
00:53:09,535 --> 00:53:10,975
go into a facet of course of

1529
00:53:10,975 --> 00:53:13,285
course i've ever seen barrington i was

1530
00:53:13,495 --> 00:53:14,875

1531
00:53:14,875 --> 00:53:16,645
was so right a bag of burger

1532
00:53:16,645 --> 00:53:18,715

1533
00:53:18,715 --> 00:53:20,125

that's important to anyone but i just

1593
00:55:27,565 --> 00:55:30,445
thought i was a germain so scott

1594
00:55:30,595 --> 00:55:32,965
like wakes up every day crying in

1595
00:55:32,965 --> 00:55:36,715
his crib and he's hired me to

1596
00:55:36,745 --> 00:55:38,695
change his diaper and sore

1597
00:55:38,695 --> 00:55:38,905
rt of

1598
00:55:40,165 --> 00:55:43,075

that's what he pays me to be

1603

birds bestie

1669
00:58:26,965 --> 00:58:29,065
laura was born in albuquerque new mexico

1670
00:58:29,665 --> 00:58:32,155
and at the time that she was

1671
00:58:32,155 --> 00:58:34,015
where my brother was born and there

1672
00:58:34,015 --> 00:58:36,715
were strange laws in place they call

1673
00:58:36,715 --> 00:58:38,485
them blue laws which is on sundays

1674
00:58:38,485 --> 00:58:41,725
you could not do certain things one

1675
00:58:41,725 --> 00:58:43,495
thing you were not allowed to do

1676
00:58:43,585 --> 00:58:47,095
in albuquerque new mexico was two

1677
00:58:47,095 --> 00:58:50,695
to pretend you had seen tv shows

1678
00:58:50,695 --> 00:58:53,245
that you had not seen oh on

1679
00:58:53,245 --> 00:58:54,625
just one day a week or once

1680
00:58:54,625 --> 00:58:56,065
a year could do it any other

1681
00:58:56,065 --> 00:58:57,715
time but on sundays you had to

1682
00:58:57,715 --> 00:58:58,735
run if you hadn't seen a show

1683
00:58:58,735 --> 00:59:00,055
you to admit you hadn't seen that

1684
00:59:00,055 --> 00:59:02,455
show so would people wait until sundays

1685
00:59:02,515 --> 00:59:04,585
