45
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:01,830

75
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:03,690
yeah now there are mosquitoes the worst

76
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:07,230
and allergies are now more common here

77
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:09,960
why didn't we get lightning bugs instead

78
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,520
of mosquitoes i would know i'm going

79
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,600

00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:52,890
for where they have run dmc from

155
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:54,960

00:05:55,038 --> 00:05:57,450
yeah plus and there but but they

157
00:05:57,450 --> 00:05:59,460
try to cover their ass by having

158
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:02,100
chris tucker say like run dmc are

159
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,200
coming out with a song called my

160
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,180
adidas next year on their next albums

161
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:07,920
like how how would he i'm sorry

162
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,368
there's breaking news that bikers in a

163
00:06:09,368 --> 00:06:13,290
movie again why why did they have

164
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:15,120
to put in something that wasn't timeline

165
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,700
ides appropriate like y da to put

166
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,830
that well it's it's about shoes i

167
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:21,810
know so they're talking about why ideas

168
00:06:21,815 --> 00:06:24,300
are cool and chris tucker says like

169
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:26,760
everyone loves adidas why even run dmc

170
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:29,430
instead of just saying write a song

171
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:31,020
about them and just like no one

172
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:33,120
knows was here like i do i

173
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,040
hope that kelly says everyone

174
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:37,890
because why run dmc themselves coming up

175
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:40,260

176
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:41,880

179
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:49,320
like what instead instead of offending me

180
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,610
the only person who would know like

181
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,750
oh my d just didn't come out

182
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:55,080

183
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:55,440
cover there

184
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,090
harass and say like they're coming out

185
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:59,280

186
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,380

commercials after actually falling

262
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:03,805
and with blood dripping into her eyes

263
00:10:03,805 --> 00:10:05,725
activating paramedic alerts

264
00:10:07,405 --> 00:10:10,285
she preceded the commercial i guess so

265
00:10:10,285 --> 00:10:11,935
i guess that's what they maybe hired

266
00:10:11,935 --> 00:10:13,465
her she came into our dish and

267
00:10:13,465 --> 00:10:15,445
i'm sorry that was like insist actually

268
00:10:15,445 --> 00:10:16,885
happen to me so i maybe she

269
00:10:16,885 --> 00:10:18,595
drew from real life i just say

270
00:10:18,595 --> 00:10:20,425
i'm honored to be here no matter

271
00:10:20,425 --> 00:10:22,405

got it i felt the salt of

278
00:10:33,655 --> 00:10:36,505
my own inside yahoo is i believe

279
00:10:36,505 --> 00:10:38,185
that they first had her in commercials

280
00:10:38,185 --> 00:10:41,545
giving testimonials about her rescue oh shit

281
00:10:41,635 --> 00:10:44,125
yeah then maybe she segue into the

282
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:45,499
acting like i could do i don't

283
00:10:45,499 --> 00:10:46,225

eyes yeah for this commercial gave me

287
00:10:51,505 --> 00:10:53,695
a helping it up would that have

288
00:10:53,695 --> 00:10:55,525
been as successful a commercial if there

289
00:10:55,525 --> 00:10:58,075
was just ripping i know it and

290
00:10:58,165 --> 00:10:59,455

00:11:03,565 --> 00:11:06,055
better because watching it as a kid

294
00:11:06,055 --> 00:11:07,405
you don't really see what's so

295
00:11:07,405 --> 00:11:09,175

her window hitter in the head yeah

307
00:11:37,705 --> 00:11:39,475
knocked her down that's why she probably

308
00:11:39,475 --> 00:11:40,525
and that was the last road she

309
00:11:40,525 --> 00:11:42,535
heard she's like that's my last day

310
00:11:43,435 --> 00:11:45,235
where you calling me when you announcing

311
00:11:45,235 --> 00:11:47,065
the ball she she ran towards the

312
00:11:47,065 --> 00:11:49,393
ball known around the world here i

313
00:11:49,517 --> 00:11:49,735
just

314
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:50,515
yeah

315
00:11:54,025 --> 00:11:55,645
a bonk on the way here i

316
00:11:55,645 --> 00:11:58,683
was wondering about golf clothes okay i

317
00:11:58,683 --> 00:12:00,625
had to say why are they what

318
00:12:00,625 --> 00:12:02,665
they are why sorry they what they

319
00:12:02,665 --> 00:12:04,075
are i have been talking about this

320
00:12:04,075 --> 00:12:06,475
on stage recently hey the golfers don't

321
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:08,545
need special clothes wow i love the

322
00:12:08,545 --> 00:12:10,675
overall this isn't the zeit guys so

323
00:12:10,705 --> 00:12:11,725
so the the

324
00:12:11,785 --> 00:12:13,315
polos that they were the golf shirt

325
00:12:13,325 --> 00:12:15,145
something where are there because you need

326
00:12:15,295 --> 00:12:18,985
because here's my guess you were supposed

327
00:12:18,985 --> 00:12:20,635
to wear a collared shirts to be

328
00:12:20,635 --> 00:12:23,485
classy probably wherever you went and so

329
00:12:23,485 --> 00:12:25,015
they were like ok well let's make

330
00:12:25,015 --> 00:12:26,065
it like a t-shirt but with a

331
00:12:26,065 --> 00:12:29,035
collar yeah right but then i thought

332
00:12:29,395 --> 00:12:31,045
okay do they want their arms to

333
00:12:31,045 --> 00:12:31,825
be free so they

334
00:12:31,885 --> 00:12:33,593
can make it smooth motion so sure

335
00:12:33,603 --> 00:12:36,415
they wear long sleeve though yeah yeah

336
00:12:36,445 --> 00:12:38,605
yeah that's a good point but then

337
00:12:38,605 --> 00:12:39,595
it's like kind of just about the

338
00:12:39,595 --> 00:12:42,085
look but what the witch cannot be

339
00:12:42,085 --> 00:12:45,805
beat but i'm not totally against the

340
00:12:45,805 --> 00:12:47,935
idea of seeing everyone on the golf

341
00:12:47,935 --> 00:12:49,435
course kind of in a uniform i

342
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:51,175
don't hate the idea of it's better

343
00:12:51,175 --> 00:12:52,045
than seeing people in sf

344
00:12:52,045 --> 00:12:53,845
sweat scoffing do you know what i

345
00:12:53,845 --> 00:12:56,095
would like first of all agreed but

346
00:12:56,095 --> 00:12:58,015
if everybody like had to wear white

347
00:12:58,045 --> 00:12:59,095
or something like that you know what

348
00:12:59,095 --> 00:12:59,905
i mean if there was like a

349
00:12:59,905 --> 00:13:02,005
standard thing that they all did and

350
00:13:02,035 --> 00:13:03,265
i thought that would be kinda cool

351
00:13:03,775 --> 00:13:05,215
the shoes in the nba had to

352
00:13:05,215 --> 00:13:06,265
be fifty one percent

353
00:13:09,505 --> 00:13:10,950
then nike paid all the fines and

354
00:13:11,035 --> 00:13:13,915
legal trees in the skies were layered

355
00:13:13,915 --> 00:13:16,195
up like crazy golfers yeah right they

356
00:13:16,195 --> 00:13:17,605
had okay so they had the let's

357
00:13:17,605 --> 00:13:19,285
let's see if we can name you

358
00:13:19,285 --> 00:13:21,509
have like a name topside golf or

359
00:13:21,513 --> 00:13:22,975
does you have like your sweater vest

360
00:13:23,005 --> 00:13:24,115
what are the things they would like

361
00:13:24,115 --> 00:13:25,975
hang off like little yarn balls or

362
00:13:25,975 --> 00:13:27,732
something why you know

363
00:13:28,195 --> 00:13:29,605
oh that was probably that was on

364
00:13:29,605 --> 00:13:31,190
their club golf clubs and the other

365
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:33,684
wouldn't wear those anyway i thought they'd

366
00:13:33,684 --> 00:13:34,825
take them off and put them on

367
00:13:34,825 --> 00:13:36,265
their clubs to keep them warm they

368
00:13:36,265 --> 00:13:37,465
were lab landers

369
00:13:39,355 --> 00:13:41,455
yeah when these were early shoes

370
00:13:42,865 --> 00:13:44,395

00:14:25,525 --> 00:14:25,885
except

390
00:14:26,695 --> 00:14:28,435

anyone who listens to the show will

634
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:38,530

682
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:28,000

683
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:31,360
over this dramatic monologue about lottie's yeah

684
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,620
well you see how all the people

685
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,990
battlestar galactica die in there

686
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:39,430
his starbucks is starbucks sometimes six feet

no no buddy starbuck is named after

689
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:47,440
starbuck okay in a way it is

690
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:52,570
because the modern battlestar galactica posits that

691
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:54,850
it's actually been back on it's very

692

that's right what you got in i

968
00:35:23,725 --> 00:35:25,405
did not know that because i immediately

969
00:35:25,405 --> 00:35:26,635
went to sleep and then when i

970
00:35:26,635 --> 00:35:28,945
got up there was wax like this

971
00:35:28,945 --> 00:35:31,465
yeah we did that's honest but we

972
00:35:31,465 --> 00:35:33,295
didn't talk about how fast he thought

973
00:35:33,295 --> 00:35:34,315
he was thought he was in the

974
00:35:34,435 --> 00:35:38,335
the leftovers yeah because e he thought

975
00:35:38,335 --> 00:35:39,055
somebody cut

976
00:35:39,178 --> 00:35:41,335
rapture oh yeah so i was fine

977
00:35:41,335 --> 00:35:42,895
with someone being in my room not

978
00:35:42,895 --> 00:35:47,095
sure he yeah exactly the thing yeah

979
00:35:47,125 --> 00:35:49,195
sure man it's such a bard i

980
00:35:49,195 --> 00:35:50,815
hope that's not gonna be true i

981
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:53,875
hope not because you enjoy although think

982
00:35:53,875 --> 00:35:55,345
of all the rings and watches and

983
00:35:55,345 --> 00:35:56,455
stuff you'd be able to pick up

984
00:35:57,355 --> 00:35:59,215
and clothes yeah

985
00:35:59,365 --> 00:36:01,075
it's true it'll be fun to just

986
00:36:01,075 --> 00:36:02,275
like big clothes on the street trim

987
00:36:02,275 --> 00:36:03,805
on i think it used to be

988
00:36:03,865 --> 00:36:05,815
i think when the rapture was first

989
00:36:05,815 --> 00:36:07,585
introduced as a concept they were like

990
00:36:07,795 --> 00:36:08,905
it's going to be ninety percent of

991
00:36:08,905 --> 00:36:10,225
the people who've gotten than the unlucky

992
00:36:10,225 --> 00:36:11,965
ten but now i think it's flipped

993
00:36:12,085 --> 00:36:13,705
where it's like for sure ten percent

994
00:36:13,705 --> 00:36:14,725
of the people would be gone yeah

995
00:36:14,725 --> 00:36:17,725
yeah yeah the righteous yes yeah sucks

996
00:36:17,725 --> 00:36:19,495
yeah sucks so it doesn't

997
00:36:19,671 --> 00:36:22,795
they can go okay i mean i

998
00:36:22,795 --> 00:36:25,585
don't mind we're just gonna hang out

999
00:36:26,155 --> 00:36:29,235

00:36:54,775 --> 00:36:56,725
the idea of dying and being okay

1014
00:36:56,725 --> 00:36:58,075
with dying like at the end of

going to die and you make peace

1019
00:37:04,255 --> 00:37:05,755

thank you for clarifying while i thought

1032
00:37:43,435 --> 00:37:45,025
cheese came alive i was just wondering

1033
00:37:45,025 --> 00:37:47,725
if the cheese submitted it because the

1034
00:37:47,725 --> 00:37:49,645
cheese stands alone but what about that

1035
00:37:49,675 --> 00:37:52,615
breathe and ham commercial where ray larson

1036
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:53,275
john

1037
00:37:54,295 --> 00:37:56,395
because the i was actually a person

1038
00:37:56,395 --> 00:37:58,615
and the cheese and then pete davidson's

1039
00:37:58,615 --> 00:38:00,865
id and that made sense from fast

1040
00:38:00,865 --> 00:38:03,715
ten yeah it was a really yeah

1041
00:38:03,865 --> 00:38:06,955
okay ah that commercial was well structured

1042
00:38:07,135 --> 00:38:09,085
it made sense and i enjoyed it

1043
00:38:09,595 --> 00:38:11,155

1044
00:38:11,275 --> 00:38:13,255

like how did pete davidson end up

1047
00:38:15,685 --> 00:38:17,695
in the summer's biggest blockbusters i'm like

1048
00:38:17,845 --> 00:38:19,915
what do you mean how he would

1049
00:38:19,945 --> 00:38:22,705
talk about him nonstop famous yeah yeah

1050
00:38:22,735 --> 00:38:26,035
that's how because if you like i

1051
00:38:26,035 --> 00:38:26,785
was an article

1052
00:38:27,925 --> 00:38:29,635
we talking why did i read this

1053
00:38:29,665 --> 00:38:31,315
i didn't read it i read the

1054
00:38:31,315 --> 00:38:33,685
headline read that's just as good like

1055
00:38:33,685 --> 00:38:34,765
how did he do to end up

1056
00:38:34,765 --> 00:38:37,375
in this world this country's biggest blockbusters

1057
00:38:37,375 --> 00:38:39,745
of the weirder that helen mirren was

1058
00:38:39,745 --> 00:38:40,765
in one yeah i mean you know

1059
00:38:40,795 --> 00:38:42,955
one what's even weird about more than

1060
00:38:42,955 --> 00:38:45,985
one three at least know she's been

1061
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:47,965
part of the fast universe oh yeah

1062
00:38:49,195 --> 00:38:52,525
weird okay does it know she's in

1063
00:38:52,525 --> 00:38:54,325
shazam too when he's at an air

1064
00:38:54,325 --> 00:38:56,545
purifier you know i additions for that

1065
00:38:56,575 --> 00:38:59,665
minutiae zam yes teddy was the new

1066
00:38:59,815 --> 00:39:04,313
shazam yeah first my agent said that

1067
00:39:04,313 --> 00:39:05,485
this is a great part if you

1068
00:39:05,485 --> 00:39:06,625
can get it and i was like

1069
00:39:06,625 --> 00:39:08,215
great and then i found out later

1070
00:39:08,215 --> 00:39:11,185
or they already had a shazam movie

1071
00:39:11,185 --> 00:39:13,405
before that yeah and the part was

1072
00:39:13,435 --> 00:39:15,655
cast well it makes sense that shazam

1073
00:39:15,655 --> 00:39:17,605
would age too i mean the little

1074
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:20,065
boy gets older so zamzam be as

1075
00:39:20,065 --> 00:39:21,295
old as you but also the cyber

1076
00:39:21,295 --> 00:39:24,595
handwritten and in my agents handwriting okay

1077
00:39:24,865 --> 00:39:28,195
weird huh shazam is the movie

1078
00:39:28,705 --> 00:39:29,815
yeah well right

1079
00:39:31,165 --> 00:39:37,195
shaq is the genie nah that's chasm

1080
00:39:37,255 --> 00:39:40,045
that's because then what is shazam it's

1081
00:39:40,135 --> 00:39:43,285
ah zachary levi is the superhero but

1082
00:39:43,285 --> 00:39:45,985
it's about a boy who when he

1083
00:39:45,985 --> 00:39:47,785
says a magic word becomes an adult

1084
00:39:47,785 --> 00:39:49,975
superhero oh and then he says the

1085
00:39:49,975 --> 00:39:51,145
word again and he turns back in

1086
00:39:51,175 --> 00:39:53,515
a little boy so when he's an

1087
00:39:53,515 --> 00:39:54,985
adult he has as much sex as

1088
00:39:54,985 --> 00:39:56,545
he possibly can yeah yeah it's good

1089
00:39:56,545 --> 00:39:57,865

1104
00:40:31,675 --> 00:40:33,085
greek bullshit up here

that paul i was

1116
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,350
you'll figure it out rush really really

1117
00:40:56,350 --> 00:40:58,510

1118
00:40:58,510 --> 00:41:00,160
that you were frightened for your life

1119
00:41:00,190 --> 00:41:02,410

and you shot that i knew it

1121
00:41:04,450 --> 00:41:06,070
was going to happen so i concocted

1122
00:41:06,070 --> 00:41:07,720
this whole story so you do it

1123
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:10,720
with universalism for the decides i don't

1124
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:11,080

1125
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,380

1128
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:22,120
i auditioned for sale in the store

1129
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:25,720
instead of just buying or selling

1130
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:28,060
to the hospital so these barely roadworthy

1131
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,320

1132
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:33,309

1133
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:38,200
right yeah i hope they asked me

1134
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:38,909
to re-enact my

1135
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:40,930
it's really smooth

1136
00:41:42,042 --> 00:41:43,570
i know you guys so well do

1137
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:44,860
you would ask me to yeah yeah

1138
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:47,159
alright this is a game called or

1139
00:41:47,174 --> 00:41:49,210
three two rather called under the umbrella

1140
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:52,480
under the umbrella dd beatty i knew

1141
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,550
the outerwear it's not wetter and it

1142
00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:57,490
is better the game starts with one

1143
00:41:57,490 --> 00:41:59,710
of us making a rule to ourselves

1144
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:01,090
for example

1145
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,270
whatever is under the umbrella has to

1146
00:42:04,270 --> 00:42:06,880
be green that's an example okay the

1147
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:08,799
color green okay we don't share it

1148
00:42:08,799 --> 00:42:10,690
with the other two of us school

1149
00:42:10,690 --> 00:42:12,070
to the color purple so then the

1150
00:42:12,070 --> 00:42:13,990
first person will say under the umbrella

1151
00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:15,130
i will bring

1152
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:19,210
elect one of these a cookie and

1153
00:42:19,210 --> 00:42:20,530
the player who made the rule will

1154
00:42:20,535 --> 00:42:22,840
say no since cookies aren't typically green

1155
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:24,490
so i think that we since their

1156
00:42:24,490 --> 00:42:27,310
yes or no yes some cookies are

1157
00:42:27,310 --> 00:42:31,180
green but but typically cookies or brown

1158
00:42:31,210 --> 00:42:34,690
shit they're brown they're light brown so

1159
00:42:34,690 --> 00:42:36,460
many can layer brown and light brown

1160
00:42:36,550 --> 00:42:40,990
yeah typically typically typically typically typically the

1161
00:42:40,990 --> 00:42:43,120
game is so fun to cookie sure

1162
00:42:43,150 --> 00:42:44,860
it's true but that's just seasonal probably

1163
00:42:44,890 --> 00:42:46,300
it's probably a lucky charms i mean

1164
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:49,180
