154
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,570
for them i don't like how they

155
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:22,680
show examples on your page because i

156
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,180
feel like a lot of people do

157
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:25,560
kind of the same thing over and

158
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,400
over again which is totally

159
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:28,020
fine it's like what are you expecting

160
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:28,860
to do write a whole new thing

161
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,810
every time but i feel like if

162
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:33,690
you watch the the sample and you

163
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:35,430
feel like you got it yeah that's

164
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:37,290
it doesn't have your name on it

165
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:39,240

a lot of fights on there i

177
00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:59,850
remember showing one very active twitter comedian

178
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:01,140
how to sign up for twitter and

179
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:03,210

00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:05,040
of like no i just don't see

00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,600
how this will work this i mean

182
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:06,720

183
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:09,150

which is going to be just disaster

187

about there being an audience that's like

00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,290
people who were invited as opposed to

00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:52,710

279
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:55,320
goes i didn't know they knew each

280
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,030
other and i thought he would surely

281
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:58,410
know how they knew each other but

282
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,780
yeah not i think they were working

283
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:01,680
on something together

284
00:10:02,405 --> 00:10:05,555
now yeah as we speak oh they

285
00:10:05,555 --> 00:10:07,985
want raymond during our show they're not

286
00:10:07,985 --> 00:10:10,775
listening i here's what here's my theory

287
00:10:11,225 --> 00:10:15,125
is that they are practicing islands in

288
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:17,615
the stream together and they're gonna oh

289
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,505
and they're going to do it instagram

290
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:21,245
i would wear the suit me love

291
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:22,505
that guy would do i

292
00:10:22,535 --> 00:10:25,295
but to tear to your bob sing

293
00:10:25,475 --> 00:10:27,892
islands in the stream would be wonderful

294
00:10:27,905 --> 00:10:28,655
awesome

295
00:10:30,275 --> 00:10:32,795
this dray what if they're doing a

296
00:10:32,795 --> 00:10:36,065
competing three-time style podcast together with one

297
00:10:36,065 --> 00:10:39,095
other person we like mike urban trout

298
00:10:39,245 --> 00:10:40,535
and we never know when he's gone

299
00:10:40,535 --> 00:10:42,155
because we can't see if you've rose

300
00:10:42,185 --> 00:10:43,955
he literally is like having a ghost

301
00:10:43,955 --> 00:10:47,255
and it's like sometimes what happened yeah

302
00:10:47,945 --> 00:10:48,785

00:11:28,325 --> 00:11:30,605
oh fan that i put right mouth

321
00:11:31,655 --> 00:11:34,865

322
00:11:34,925 --> 00:11:36,668
of the hollywood walk of fame ceremony

323
00:11:36,668 --> 00:11:38,296
now i wanna know tom tell us

324
00:11:38,296 --> 00:11:39,065
a little about in case we don't

325
00:11:39,065 --> 00:11:40,895
feel like watching that i was younger

326
00:11:41,195 --> 00:11:42,185
i'd never been to one of these

327
00:11:42,185 --> 00:11:45,365
things before and you know i was

328
00:11:45,425 --> 00:11:47,525
ah excited to go and i thought

329
00:11:47,525 --> 00:11:49,655
this is such a weird thing and

330
00:11:49,655 --> 00:11:51,815
because knowing bob um

331
00:11:52,115 --> 00:11:56,405
it's like ah of course he's he

332
00:11:57,515 --> 00:12:00,305
you know deserves this kind of recognition

333
00:12:00,305 --> 00:12:02,405
for his work and the way you

334
00:12:02,405 --> 00:12:05,255
know you you you essentially you submit

335
00:12:05,585 --> 00:12:08,825
to ah the hollywood chamber of commerce

336
00:12:08,825 --> 00:12:10,625
and the you know the city councillor

337
00:12:10,625 --> 00:12:11,675
went right okay because that's how i

338
00:12:11,675 --> 00:12:11,945
was wanting

339
00:12:12,005 --> 00:12:13,265
i know that you have to pay

340
00:12:13,475 --> 00:12:15,515
ten thousand dollars yeah for your star

341
00:12:15,515 --> 00:12:17,705
it's not given to you however it's

342
00:12:17,705 --> 00:12:19,355
a great honor so anyone yeah much

343
00:12:19,355 --> 00:12:20,915
do whatever you're doing and not everybody

344
00:12:20,915 --> 00:12:22,715
you can't just pay ten thousand dollars

345
00:12:22,715 --> 00:12:24,302
you automatically get no no you be

346
00:12:24,302 --> 00:12:25,829
lie get approved and then you yeah

347
00:12:25,829 --> 00:12:28,415
yeah yeah so um you know but

348
00:12:28,415 --> 00:12:30,305
it's not like bob is not the

349
00:12:30,305 --> 00:12:32,045
most hollywood of people

350
00:12:32,165 --> 00:12:33,395
you know what i mean so what

351
00:12:33,455 --> 00:12:35,435
it was like a weird thing and

352
00:12:35,435 --> 00:12:38,435
he recognized that too and so um

353
00:12:38,855 --> 00:12:40,325
so it's all these were all gathered

354
00:12:40,325 --> 00:12:43,835
around on little folding chairs um and

355
00:12:43,835 --> 00:12:45,305
there's ah there's a ah like a

356
00:12:45,365 --> 00:12:48,815
red carpeted davis where ah there's a

357
00:12:48,815 --> 00:12:51,245
podium and mike and um and people

358
00:12:51,245 --> 00:12:52,295
speak firs

359
00:12:52,385 --> 00:12:54,335
people get up from the chamber of

360
00:12:54,335 --> 00:12:57,095
commerce and they say they're whatever and

361
00:12:57,155 --> 00:12:58,235
and by the way were you tested

362
00:12:58,235 --> 00:12:59,375
for covert or was that just a

363
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:01,805
coincidence oh because it was all outdoors

364
00:13:02,045 --> 00:13:03,845
wow it was all outdoors so they

365
00:13:03,845 --> 00:13:05,105
had to people had covert and they

366
00:13:05,105 --> 00:13:06,845
couldn't come yes but i think they

367
00:13:06,845 --> 00:13:10,925
tested before either that day or sometime

368
00:13:11,015 --> 00:13:12,365
just coincidentally they have found out

369
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:15,575
yeah maybe felt sick exactly exactly so

370
00:13:15,605 --> 00:13:17,645

386
00:13:49,115 --> 00:13:50,525

387
00:13:50,555 --> 00:13:52,715
abruptly down so crazy

388
00:13:52,775 --> 00:13:53,825

400
00:14:15,635 --> 00:14:17,105
like thirty grand for it right i

401
00:14:17,105 --> 00:14:18,635
thought it was ten thousand oh i

402
00:14:18,635 --> 00:14:20,315
think yes i heard it was five

403
00:14:20,315 --> 00:14:22,775
hundred dollars okay i'm looking i heard

404
00:14:22,775 --> 00:14:24,005
it's ten cameos

405
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:27,635
it's a fifty five thousand dollars i

406
00:14:27,635 --> 00:14:31,145
was paying ah okay so ah now

407
00:14:31,145 --> 00:14:32,465
that makes more sense to be honest

408
00:14:32,465 --> 00:14:34,715
ten thousand did seem low given how

409
00:14:34,745 --> 00:14:36,935
few areas of the sidewalk are left

410
00:14:36,995 --> 00:14:40,295
that's usually why ah like with in

411
00:14:40,295 --> 00:14:42,965

00:14:50,255 --> 00:14:51,972

00:14:52,131 --> 00:14:53,705

finances handled and buy a cameo from

508
00:18:01,415 --> 00:18:03,125
me that's a good way to invest

509
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:05,045
actually when you buy a cameo it

510
00:18:05,045 --> 00:18:07,564
appreciates in value so yes you should

511
00:18:07,564 --> 00:18:10,355

512
00:18:10,355 --> 00:18:11,885

00:26:35,215 --> 00:26:38,095
alexander it's like waits for fly or

754
00:26:38,125 --> 00:26:39,685
back back in like nineteen eighty or

755
00:26:39,685 --> 00:26:42,055
whatever yeah before humana oh they were

756
00:26:42,055 --> 00:26:43,315
stars wow

757
00:26:43,315 --> 00:26:46,525
wow about this very ambitious and strange

758
00:26:46,555 --> 00:26:51,175
sondheim musical that was ah it's told

759
00:26:51,235 --> 00:26:54,715
ah backwards everything it's it's like nato

760
00:26:55,105 --> 00:26:57,985
or like betray exactly or betrayed this

761
00:26:57,985 --> 00:27:00,085
bird betrayed with a little momento mixed

762
00:27:00,085 --> 00:27:02,845
in betrayal but yeah and so is

763
00:27:02,845 --> 00:27:03,295
it

764
00:27:03,535 --> 00:27:05,365
oh yeah i'm sure that's greenery made

765
00:27:05,365 --> 00:27:06,775
recently or it's an old document the

766
00:27:06,775 --> 00:27:09,385
documentary is also backwards which is very

767
00:27:09,385 --> 00:27:10,735
hard to learn to turn yeah

768
00:27:12,505 --> 00:27:13,795
it starts with the words the end

769
00:27:15,715 --> 00:27:17,815
it's a pretty recent documentary but there's

770
00:27:17,815 --> 00:27:20,785
a ton of archival footage and photographs

771
00:27:20,815 --> 00:27:23,095
and they interviewed the people and it's

772
00:27:23,125 --> 00:27:25,885
it's really absolutely worth watching because as

773
00:27:25,915 --> 00:27:27,385
i was saying it starts from the

774
00:27:27,385 --> 00:27:29,485
point of view of these characters as

775
00:27:29,755 --> 00:27:32,845
middle-aged people older people looking back at

776
00:27:32,845 --> 00:27:35,155
their lives and so they d age

777
00:27:35,155 --> 00:27:38,065
age throughout the show and and it

778
00:27:38,065 --> 00:27:40,225
ends with them is like bright youths

779
00:27:40,225 --> 00:27:42,265
who have optimism and all this kind

780
00:27:42,265 --> 00:27:44,455
of stuff yeah oh wow it's it's

781
00:27:44,455 --> 00:27:46,825
a great idea but like to have

782
00:27:47,185 --> 00:27:49,405
the same people do it it's it's

783
00:27:49,405 --> 00:27:50,635

784
00:27:50,635 --> 00:27:53,215

934
00:33:01,865 --> 00:33:04,025

1225
00:44:37,290 --> 00:44:38,880
they also had a segment called a

1226
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:40,410
word from us kids where they would

1227
00:44:40,410 --> 00:44:42,330
go to a school and like to

1228
00:44:42,330 --> 00:44:43,530
see some kids and they would do

1229
00:44:43,530 --> 00:44:44,850
some sort of activity and show you

1230
00:44:44,850 --> 00:44:47,370
about it and there was one that's

1231
00:44:47,370 --> 00:44:49,710
very memorable which always comes to mind

1232
00:44:49,710 --> 00:44:51,210
where these kids were drawing

1233
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:53,338
um different sorts of heroes or something

1234
00:44:53,380 --> 00:44:56,040
one person drew paley the soccer player

1235
00:44:56,430 --> 00:44:59,340
and then they said pay les paleo

1236
00:44:59,370 --> 00:45:01,110
scores great goals

1237
00:45:02,580 --> 00:45:03,990
but there's no second part of a

1238
00:45:03,990 --> 00:45:06,150
rhyme there was definitely other stuff that

1239
00:45:06,150 --> 00:45:07,920
happened but i don't remember anything besides

1240
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:08,850
that and i bet you anyone who

1241
00:45:08,850 --> 00:45:10,170
knows i'm talking about only remember that

1242
00:45:10,170 --> 00:45:11,880
part hey there was also this one

1243
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:12,810
where they go to a black school

1244
00:45:12,810 --> 00:45:14,670
for the blind and these kids show

1245
00:45:14,670 --> 00:45:16,620
how they baked cookies and i always

1246
00:45:16,620 --> 00:45:18,840
remember that they would tap the they

1247
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:21,090
would hit the um baking sheet with

1248
00:45:21,090 --> 00:45:22,470
a spoon to see where there was

1249
00:45:22,470 --> 00:45:24,510
a space to put the da so

00:45:42,660 --> 00:45:44,100
i've never been disappointed that you haven't

1258
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:45,390
patented something

1259
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:48,600

1260
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:49,410
chocolate chip cookie

1261
00:45:51,450 --> 00:45:52,860

um have either of you guys ever

1263
00:45:55,980 --> 00:45:58,650

is it a home makeover show no

1266
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:09,540
it was ostensibly a kid show and

1267
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:12,060
it was this fucking old lady who

1268
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:13,560
lived in the hodgepodge lodge

1269
00:46:14,310 --> 00:46:16,020
she was not like a character person

1270
00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:17,310
she was just an old lady who

1271
00:46:17,310 --> 00:46:19,680
did crafts and she would show you

1272
00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:22,350
some crafts and it was so i

1273
00:46:22,350 --> 00:46:24,000
know i wish i got to look

1274
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,440
forward to youtube because at the time

1275
00:46:25,470 --> 00:46:27,960
it enraged me because as a kid

1276
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:29,370
i want to be entertained this was

1277
00:46:29,370 --> 00:46:31,560
not entertaining i know it was boring

1278
00:46:31,590 --> 00:46:33,000
shit and was that kind of thing

1279
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,230
where the

1280
00:46:34,230 --> 00:46:35,460
this is supposed to be for me

1281
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:36,800

1282
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:38,130

something you lap it up yeah you'd

1472
00:53:59,705 --> 00:54:01,115
you certainly do a lot a lot

1473
00:54:01,115 --> 00:54:03,395
like some of the bystanders here who

1474
00:54:03,665 --> 00:54:05,825
are refusing to talk about who set

1475
00:54:05,825 --> 00:54:06,335
the fire

1476
00:54:06,995 --> 00:54:09,125
yeah right bitch have the fire department

1477
00:54:09,125 --> 00:54:11,105
released the names of any suspects to

00:54:11,105 --> 00:54:13,745
any cause of the fire well i

1479
00:54:13,745 --> 00:54:14,795
mean i don't know why you would

1480
00:54:14,795 --> 00:54:17,555
be so concerned about that ralph um

1481
00:54:17,585 --> 00:54:19,415
because aren't you used to just kind

1482
00:54:19,415 --> 00:54:20,525
of turning your back to that kind

1483
00:54:20,525 --> 00:54:22,685
of thing now bitch when we talk

1484
00:54:22,685 --> 00:54:24,455
about that well we mean by that

1485
00:54:24,455 --> 00:54:26,045
is that of course i'm just clicking

1486
00:54:26,045 --> 00:54:26,855
on the same page as you

1487
00:54:27,305 --> 00:54:30,275
that ralph is somebody who doesn't really

1488
00:54:30,665 --> 00:54:32,530
stand up for what's right yeah yeah

1489
00:54:32,555 --> 00:54:33,905
i beg your pardon what did you

1490
00:54:33,905 --> 00:54:35,315
say yeah what do you stand up

1491
00:54:35,315 --> 00:54:36,935
for up for what's right and yeah

1492
00:54:37,445 --> 00:54:38,735
you know i mean it's not like

1493
00:54:38,735 --> 00:54:41,285
you care about people taking personal responsibility

1494
00:54:41,285 --> 00:54:42,455
so why do you care if they

1495
00:54:42,455 --> 00:54:44,225
found a suspect or not okay well

1496
00:54:44,225 --> 00:54:45,845
it is part of the news and

1497
00:54:45,905 --> 00:54:47,315
i it sounds like you're acute

1498
00:54:47,315 --> 00:54:48,725
oozing me of something and and something

1499
00:54:48,725 --> 00:54:51,125
to do with food and restaurants and

1500
00:54:51,185 --> 00:54:53,285
eating not speaking not standing up for

1501
00:54:53,285 --> 00:54:55,355
someone and i think it's that ah

1502
00:54:55,415 --> 00:54:57,395
someone i saw someone be slapped at

1503
00:54:57,395 --> 00:54:59,105
a restaurant and i didn't say anything

1504
00:54:59,315 --> 00:55:01,415
well i'll tell yourself this one is

1505
00:55:01,415 --> 00:55:02,915
that easy this was one of the

1506
00:55:02,915 --> 00:55:05,915
few restaurants that catered to a poorer

1507
00:55:05,915 --> 00:55:07,475
clientele people who were

1508
00:55:07,475 --> 00:55:10,535
we're very concerned with how they spent

1509
00:55:10,535 --> 00:55:12,395
their money i'm sure penny pinchers i

1510
00:55:12,395 --> 00:55:13,625
don't know of another way to say

1511
00:55:13,625 --> 00:55:16,145
this but they were there with their

1512
00:55:16,145 --> 00:55:18,125
money they certainly we were thoughtful about

1513
00:55:18,185 --> 00:55:19,595
how they spent about how they spent

1514
00:55:19,595 --> 00:55:21,995
it yeah and unfortunately this place is

1515
00:55:21,995 --> 00:55:23,585
now gone i actually think i think

1516
00:55:23,585 --> 00:55:25,265
google was named after this word

1517
00:55:26,465 --> 00:55:27,785
i mean it certainly rhymes with it

1518
00:55:27,785 --> 00:55:28,055
but

1519
00:55:29,165 --> 00:55:30,755
but ah in any case

1520
00:55:32,195 --> 00:55:33,305
i mean because google is a free

1521
00:55:33,305 --> 00:55:34,985
search engine and and the word that

1522
00:55:34,985 --> 00:55:37,055
rhymes is a cheap way to be

1523
00:55:37,115 --> 00:55:38,709
yeah that's true but ah and really

1524
00:55:38,721 --> 00:55:41,225
you're saying froogle froogle whoa yeah you're

1525
00:55:41,225 --> 00:55:43,055
saying is one so you're saying i

1526
00:55:43,055 --> 00:55:44,525
believe if i if i'm correct and

1527
00:55:44,525 --> 00:55:45,515
we'll get back to the fire just

1528
00:55:45,515 --> 00:55:47,135
a minute bitch but what you're saying

1529
00:55:47,135 --> 00:55:49,745
is that is that i'm i'm i'm

1530
00:55:49,745 --> 00:55:52,115
a cheapskate well you're saying you

1531
00:55:52,225 --> 00:55:54,035
you certainly interacted with one quite a

1532
00:55:54,035 --> 00:55:55,445
lot when your good friends quite one

1533
00:55:55,565 --> 00:55:57,695
very famously frugal and um yeah very

1534
00:55:57,695 --> 00:56:00,911
famously frugal and also ah you know

1535
00:56:01,056 --> 00:56:02,975
was a restaurant tour of sorts and

1536
00:56:02,975 --> 00:56:03,815
a creep ass

1537
00:56:05,675 --> 00:56:07,415
ah you might be talking about my

1538
00:56:07,415 --> 00:56:10,505
friend ah jeff smith ah if i

1539
00:56:10,535 --> 00:56:11,885
if i'm not much mistaken and of

1540
00:56:11,885 --> 00:56:14,315
course i have i have a detailed

1541
00:56:14,345 --> 00:56:16,925
our relationship and how i didn't know

1542
00:56:17,465 --> 00:56:18,965
what he was doing at the time

1543
00:56:18,965 --> 00:56:20,585
and that's why i never said anything

1544
00:56:20,825 --> 00:56:22,205
yeah it looks like the fire bitch

1545
00:56:22,205 --> 00:56:24,545
has gone down completely behind you because

1546
00:56:24,575 --> 00:56:24,995
you know

1547
00:56:25,055 --> 00:56:26,975
yeah it actually just burnt out just

1548
00:56:26,975 --> 00:56:28,265
while we were talking because the hearing

1549
00:56:28,265 --> 00:56:29,945
is gone the buildings totally down the

1550
00:56:29,945 --> 00:56:31,805
people are gone and everything has gotten

1551
00:56:31,805 --> 00:56:34,115
so that was um horrible reporting on

1552
00:56:34,115 --> 00:56:35,465
your part bitch and i yeah it

1553
00:56:35,465 --> 00:56:37,385
was not paying attention sorry yeah i

1554
00:56:37,385 --> 00:56:39,455
do hope that um the firemen weren't

1555
00:56:39,455 --> 00:56:40,565
just listening to us and they were

1556
00:56:40,565 --> 00:56:41,585
trying to put the fire out but

1557
00:56:41,585 --> 00:56:43,145
maybe they were they were pretty distracted

1558
00:56:43,145 --> 00:56:44,405
by me because i was waving to

1559
00:56:44,405 --> 00:56:45,155
