00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:00,450

8
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:25,500
head in the zoo you're absolutely going

9
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:26,610
to but i do think about the

10
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:29,220
zoo a lot really yeah i remember

11
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:30,570
what do you think about it i

12
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:32,790
think i think it smells okay and

13
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:33,600
one by one so

14
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:35,370
i want to buy one with someone

15
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:36,750
else so i can say we bought

16
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:38,160
a zoo yes yes so kind of

17
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,750
like just on any given day you're

18
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:41,250
just kind of like the zoo smells

19
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:45,240
yeah and even our yeah and you

20
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:47,340
know you are right thank you and

21
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:49,260
thanks because you know why and here's

22
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:52,830
my theory the animals shit everywhere interesting

23
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:53,760
and then the people clean

24
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,520
enough but not right away i think

25
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,650
it's tourists okay yeah i think they

26
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:00,510
make the smell i think it's people

27
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:01,710
who are tauruses

28
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:05,070
can you imagine if we we just

29
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:06,660
lived in a zoo year round like

30
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:09,330
if like aliens abducted us yeah like

31
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:10,950
a slaughterhouse five kind of situation what

32
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:13,290
kind of ours suck man what if

33
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:14,460
people are coming by and looking at

34
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:15,990
us yeah i hope a slaughterhouse five

35
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:17,640
doesn't have honestly it's fine i hope

36
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,720
that every day if we are in

37
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,760
a zoo it's not that bad they

38
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:21,930
did a good job yeah because we

39
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:22,766
each get to kind of make it

40
00:01:22,766 --> 00:01:23,040
our own

41
00:01:23,132 --> 00:01:26,820
a very wide ranging habitat because evolves

42
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,680
planes we don't know we don't know

43
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,090
what the other planets are they might

44
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,850
be zoo visitors yeah they probably are

45
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,740
right because like yeah we think are

46
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:35,880
wonderful so you've got to put a

47
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,830
quarter like we think it's amazing to

48
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:39,090
have like planes and stuff but like

49
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:40,200
if you went to another planet and

50
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,340
you saw what it was like when

51
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:42,540
they don't have a zoo there yeah

52
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:43,200
you'd be like

53
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:44,790
oh we're actually really confined they think

54
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:46,410
it's cute that we get plain yeah

55
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:47,580
they're like well they also think they're

56
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:49,380

110
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:56,070
watching the show for years

111
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,080
oh by the way we forgot to

112
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,752
tell you all of these are stories

113
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:01,380
a room of writers wrote that one

114
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:05,940

00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,277
it's good is but it's good

116
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,450
i'd bet it's a good bet alright

117
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:13,830
so it's been less than twenty four

118
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:15,300
hours since we've seen each other so

119
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,980
much has gone down to so much

120
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:19,050
okay tell us everything i watched more

121
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:21,750
love is blind oh okay reality week

122
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:23,430
watching more survivor i'm not sure why

00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,770
people why the hell oh so sorry

124
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:28,920
my trainers australia ah the traitors australia

125
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:32,430
love is blind um i'm people are

126
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:34,380
growing on me the first episode they

127
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:36,480
put in there people who straight up

128
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:39,210
leave yeah so which is a good

129
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:41,460
thing and then they have some love

130
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:43,470
happening and i'm excited but i always

131
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:45,840
wonder because the people who don't make

132
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,040
it to the altar are the same

133
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,480
ones to me like right in the

134
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,160
bachelor were in this she really should

135
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:52,710
but like what kind of situation would

136
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:53,580
you have to be in in your

137
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:55,590
life in order to undergo a love

138
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:57,240
is blind it's a great question kind

139
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,830
of you know i what i watched

140
00:04:58,830 --> 00:04:59,966
that and i think about that because

141
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:02,730
i just go you're really limiting the

142
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:03,840
pool in a way but then you're

143
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,070
like but you've but these are people

144
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:06,600
who've been trying to date on the

145
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,030
apps and people who supposedly are ready

146
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:10,320
for marriage when yeah well

147
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:12,270
narrows everything down this is the last

148
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:14,970
resort i've tried literally everything else i

149
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:16,560
should go in this game show but

150
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,080
there's one guy who's saying who's literally

151
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,360
like i'm about a bad person i

152
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,860
don't think i'm a good person yet

153
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:25,090
or something and then this girl is

154
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:26,760
bad to get engaged to him yeah

155
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:27,990
she already knew that he said that

156
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:28,980
just like that's a red flag for

157
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:30,480
me and i'm like it should be

158
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:33,210
that's pretty much like it's a red

159
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:35,310
flag it's red glass you get one

160
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:37,590
hundred flags yeah yeah exactly it's just

161
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:39,000
one wait is this the guy that

i fuck up and put together like

251
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:31,230
a world that has enslaved the vampires

252
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,730
oh okay

253
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,290

thing he thinks about yeah absolutely give

265
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:58,080
me always think the human head weighs

268
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:03,720

276
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:23,190

jonathan le nikki agree with me yeah

278
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,240

you were trying that southern charm was

304
00:10:15,005 --> 00:10:17,615
the only one we watched because was

305
00:10:17,624 --> 00:10:20,345

00:10:21,845 --> 00:10:24,365
yeah paul you were bad well believe

307
00:10:24,365 --> 00:10:25,715
me we knew it was a mistake

308
00:10:25,715 --> 00:10:27,035
but we couldn't stop making it season

309
00:10:27,035 --> 00:10:28,535
after season because you would watch and

310
00:10:28,535 --> 00:10:29,855
go like look at that building we've

311
00:10:29,855 --> 00:10:31,895
been there yeah but you just didn't

312
00:10:31,895 --> 00:10:32,915
know how much of the sound don't

313
00:10:32,975 --> 00:10:34,295
you didn't know how good he don't

314
00:10:34,295 --> 00:10:35,968
gaf you know like you know and

315
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:38,105
you're limiting yourself oh absolutely and and

316
00:10:38,105 --> 00:10:40,685
of course with vanderpump now in the

317
00:10:40,715 --> 00:10:41,735
wake of sandoval

318
00:10:41,735 --> 00:10:44,405
all ah it being like the

319
00:10:47,075 --> 00:10:49,895
it being about ah like the mass

320
00:10:50,045 --> 00:10:53,345
completely dropping yeah and now they're acknowledging

321
00:10:53,345 --> 00:10:54,875
they have an audience they're acknowledging people

322
00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:57,425
watch the show there's not not enough

323
00:10:57,545 --> 00:10:59,105
as far as i'm concerned where they

324
00:10:59,105 --> 00:11:00,665
should be saying like you know the

325
00:11:00,665 --> 00:11:02,405
only reason this is a quote unquote

326
00:11:02,405 --> 00:11:03,725
friend group is because we're on a

327
00:11:03,725 --> 00:11:05,225
tv show we would never hang out

328
00:11:05,225 --> 00:11:05,735
with each other

329
00:11:05,945 --> 00:11:07,505
they're getting close to that though yeah

330
00:11:07,565 --> 00:11:08,675
i feel like they're getting very close

331
00:11:08,675 --> 00:11:09,995
to that if this is the closest

332
00:11:09,995 --> 00:11:11,975
company not even friends are to be

333
00:11:12,545 --> 00:11:13,955
did not know that they're not even

334
00:11:13,955 --> 00:11:15,875
friends maybe they're not friends any more

335
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:17,105
or that how much of it is

336
00:11:17,105 --> 00:11:19,235
for show like like like we're doing

337
00:11:19,235 --> 00:11:20,435
a tv show and we'd never hang

338
00:11:20,435 --> 00:11:21,995
out when the tv shows not on

339
00:11:22,115 --> 00:11:23,675
yeah there's there's like a scene coming

340
00:11:23,795 --> 00:11:25,445
up so much time and later episode

341
00:11:25,445 --> 00:11:25,895
where there's

342
00:11:25,925 --> 00:11:27,875
somebody's challenged on it you know the

343
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:29,435
future you know is that from is

344
00:11:29,435 --> 00:11:30,665
that are you are you saying that

345
00:11:30,665 --> 00:11:31,745
in life you're saying that because the

346
00:11:31,745 --> 00:11:34,385
cameras are here which is like it's

347
00:11:34,385 --> 00:11:36,695
wild to watch but like i actually

348
00:11:36,725 --> 00:11:38,795
we just really quick yeah okay really

349
00:11:38,795 --> 00:11:41,615

351
00:11:43,415 --> 00:11:45,215
those two quick know i feel like

352
00:11:45,485 --> 00:11:46,055
if if

353
00:11:46,085 --> 00:11:47,495
you're at that point it's almost like

354
00:11:47,495 --> 00:11:48,785
how we don't even want to share

355
00:11:48,785 --> 00:11:50,345
a real story until we're recording it's

356
00:11:50,345 --> 00:11:53,315
like they should just know i yeah

357
00:11:53,345 --> 00:11:55,745
cool op story for mamas they they

358
00:11:55,925 --> 00:11:58,205
they really could do know what to

359
00:11:58,475 --> 00:12:01,595
communicate and waste good stuff that they

360
00:12:01,595 --> 00:12:03,035
could be doing for the shows that's

361
00:12:03,035 --> 00:12:04,143
why we just don't even hang it

362
00:12:04,143 --> 00:12:05,735
that's why we need to do reveal

363
00:12:05,735 --> 00:12:06,215
our connect

364
00:12:06,215 --> 00:12:09,185

connections because he thinks it's bullshit and

369
00:12:19,052 --> 00:12:20,255
i just got the new york times

370
00:12:20,255 --> 00:12:21,425
bummed me out i don't want the

371
00:12:21,425 --> 00:12:23,315
new york jets the old gray lady

372
00:12:23,405 --> 00:12:25,175
related the paper of record okay so

373
00:12:25,175 --> 00:12:26,375
we're gonna say about vidant

374
00:12:26,405 --> 00:12:28,715
a pimp ah so you said the

375
00:12:28,715 --> 00:12:30,995
one guy was annoying on that show

376
00:12:30,995 --> 00:12:33,245
and then you sort of backtrack that

377
00:12:33,245 --> 00:12:34,715
you felt bad about it huh yeah

378
00:12:35,015 --> 00:12:37,599
but here's the thing he is yeah

379
00:12:37,775 --> 00:12:40,025
well i want to say i feel

380
00:12:40,025 --> 00:12:42,515
like i feel like the idea of

381
00:12:42,515 --> 00:12:44,315
these shows and i'm not saying this

382
00:12:44,315 --> 00:12:46,535
is positive but i feel like

383
00:12:46,606 --> 00:12:49,385
these shows are they're inviting us to

384
00:12:49,385 --> 00:12:51,215
do that and they're giving us license

385
00:12:51,215 --> 00:12:53,165
to do that that's that's kind of

386
00:12:53,165 --> 00:12:55,385
their whole point is you're looking through

387
00:12:55,385 --> 00:12:56,825
a window at these people and you're

388
00:12:56,825 --> 00:12:59,165
making your opinions about them yes yes

389
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:00,635
and from week ten i know they're

390
00:13:00,635 --> 00:13:02,375
talking about complicit in it but at

391
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:04,055
the same time they're they're young and

392
00:13:04,055 --> 00:13:05,195
don't know what they're doing and then

393
00:13:05,195 --> 00:13:06,635
suddenly there's a

394
00:13:06,695 --> 00:13:08,585
pending on the show yeah some of

395
00:13:08,585 --> 00:13:09,665
the love is blind people are not

396
00:13:09,665 --> 00:13:10,835
that young but some are like twenty

397
00:13:10,835 --> 00:13:12,635
four but somewhere like thirty three thirty

398
00:13:12,635 --> 00:13:13,955
four year old but guess what those

399
00:13:13,955 --> 00:13:15,785
people can be annoying yeah yeah yeah

400
00:13:16,235 --> 00:13:18,005
and i mean it's a also a

401
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:20,225
really tough situation to not be annoying

402
00:13:20,225 --> 00:13:23,615
in because slowly your trying to find

403
00:13:23,615 --> 00:13:25,595
your husband and wife through a partition

404
00:13:25,745 --> 00:13:26,855
and as lily saw

405
00:13:26,855 --> 00:13:28,445
sullivan put it you're like in a

406
00:13:28,445 --> 00:13:30,785
warehouse that's freezing it seems because they're

407
00:13:30,785 --> 00:13:32,465
always they always a blankets around them

408
00:13:32,516 --> 00:13:34,145
that's a recipe for annoying i do

409
00:13:34,145 --> 00:13:36,995
think that they're getting fed more actively

410
00:13:37,025 --> 00:13:40,625
because yetzer where the blankets they always

411
00:13:40,625 --> 00:13:42,935
have like a girl learning blankets around

412
00:13:42,935 --> 00:13:45,035
them but they're also just you know

413
00:13:45,035 --> 00:13:47,015
wearing a cocktail dress

414
00:13:47,045 --> 00:13:48,455
cute dress maybe it's like it's not

415
00:13:48,455 --> 00:13:51,605
that welcome but like the pose is

416
00:13:51,635 --> 00:13:53,465
very raw let it go they have

417
00:13:53,495 --> 00:13:55,325

421
00:14:00,305 --> 00:14:02,975

00:14:02,975 --> 00:14:05,555

cna sugar still

498
00:16:44,615 --> 00:16:47,375
exists why do they not advertise anymore

499
00:16:47,405 --> 00:16:48,995
it was everywhere in the seventy s

500
00:16:48,995 --> 00:16:50,285
and eight well that was back when

501
00:16:50,285 --> 00:16:52,295
you guys didn't know that you could

502
00:16:52,295 --> 00:16:54,965
just buy sugar right they so it

503
00:16:54,965 --> 00:16:56,555
was like oh that's right now available

we're good everyone knows about us i

511
00:17:06,665 --> 00:17:07,955

513
00:17:11,555 --> 00:17:12,275

that song until the seventies or eighties

520
00:17:25,925 --> 00:17:27,575

766
00:26:43,655 --> 00:26:45,065
know if if it's shaving your head

767
00:26:45,125 --> 00:26:47,375

768
00:26:47,375 --> 00:26:48,935
for him it was sunglasses wearing a

769
00:26:48,935 --> 00:26:50,615
tuxedo and shaving his head those were

770
00:26:50,615 --> 00:26:52,325
the three things in a combo that

771
00:26:52,325 --> 00:26:52,595
make

772
00:26:53,105 --> 00:26:54,455
like sunglasses like joe biden

but didn't say um are we allowed

1083
00:37:35,735 --> 00:37:36,125
to do that

1084
00:37:37,385 --> 00:37:38,795

good friend harris ah coined that term

1087
00:37:43,595 --> 00:37:47,615
and please incorrectly to create the lexicon

1088
00:37:47,615 --> 00:37:49,145
yeah it's in the dictionary butter is

1089
00:37:49,175 --> 00:37:50,675
is it you had to pay for

1090
00:37:50,675 --> 00:37:51,995
your app it was probably because they're

1091
00:37:51,995 --> 00:37:53,975
updating it with humble brush shit now

1092
00:37:54,035 --> 00:37:55,205

1101
00:38:10,235 --> 00:38:13,085
between coining a slang term and coining

1102
00:38:13,085 --> 00:38:14,615
a word that is then used in

1103
00:38:14,615 --> 00:38:15,665
perpetuity yes

1104
00:38:17,645 --> 00:38:18,575
but i think at being in the

1105
00:38:18,575 --> 00:38:21,425
dictionary gives it a very long lasting

1106
00:38:21,455 --> 00:38:22,595
like the person who came up with

1107
00:38:22,625 --> 00:38:24,515

1112
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:35,135

glass although like it's made of glass

1116

mike no

1226
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:36,770
no i it was a game that

1227
00:42:36,770 --> 00:42:38,420
i had like found on a blog

1228
00:42:39,110 --> 00:42:40,700
a weblog okay this this blog that

1229
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:41,840
i follow where they were talking about

1230
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:43,250
gameplay at the dinner table and then

1231
00:42:43,250 --> 00:42:44,840
this all the people were commenting and

1232
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:46,370
i thought this one this is this

1233
00:42:46,370 --> 00:42:48,170
is it's very interesting i don't remember

1234
00:42:48,170 --> 00:42:50,240
you saying this at all great i

1235
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:51,530
think we all were like huh and

1236
00:42:51,530 --> 00:42:53,120
then we could ever ask wow i

1237
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:54,740
don't quite understand yeah we do need

1238
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:55,610
to we need to

1239
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:57,050
slow it down and explain it again

1240
00:42:57,740 --> 00:43:00,380
for example if the number is ten

1241
00:43:00,410 --> 00:43:01,970
or a hymnal and the guests are

1242
00:43:01,970 --> 00:43:04,280
gives the category films the person being

1243
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:06,170
asked to reply with a film they

1244
00:43:06,170 --> 00:43:09,770
consider a ten out of ten okay

1245
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:11,060
i've had a few rounds the guest

1246
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:13,160
or tries to guess the number okay

1247
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:15,050
so basically because we're going off of

1248
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:15,920
how we know

1249
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:17,780
know each other yeah we're gonna say

1250
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:19,790
oh because scott i know scott loves

1251
00:43:19,790 --> 00:43:21,410
that movie he must have the number

1252
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:23,180
here's here's how we should score it

1253
00:43:23,270 --> 00:43:25,970
in my opinion you shouldn't after we

1254
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:28,370
after the two people who know the

1255
00:43:28,370 --> 00:43:31,820
number give their things the person should

1256
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:35,330
give their guests and they get a

1257
00:43:35,330 --> 00:43:36,080
point for each

1258
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:39,470
each time they guess incorrectly and whoever

1259
00:43:39,470 --> 00:43:41,120
has the lowest number at the end

1260
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:43,430
of this wins does that make sense

1261
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:45,110
why wouldn't you get a point for

1262
00:43:45,110 --> 00:43:47,630
getting it correct because if it takes

1263
00:43:47,630 --> 00:43:49,310
you four tries how would we score

1264
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:52,940
icy okay okay all right so ah

1265
00:43:52,970 --> 00:43:55,280

1266
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:56,240

1269
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:01,820
that what's happening so lauren i'm going

1270
00:44:01,820 --> 00:44:02,600
then do i come up with the

1271
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:05,630

actors in terms of how much we

00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:25,220
like them or in terms of how

1281
00:44:25,220 --> 00:44:27,890
much i think they are good well

1282
00:44:27,890 --> 00:44:29,840
i owe what we think

1283
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:33,530
it's what we think because it's going

1284
00:44:33,530 --> 00:44:35,390
off of our subjective things like we

1285
00:44:35,390 --> 00:44:36,770
