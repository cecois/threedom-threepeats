00:19:26,729 --> 00:19:27,555
if okay if they're like you go

556
00:19:27,555 --> 00:19:28,635
to jail for six months but then

557
00:19:28,635 --> 00:19:30,555
you get this amount of money and

558
00:19:30,615 --> 00:19:31,545
you never have to go to jail

559
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:34,185
again well this guy could go to

560
00:19:34,185 --> 00:19:36,530
jail again alright if you don't you

561
00:19:36,615 --> 00:19:37,845
never if you don't do anything bad

562
00:19:37,905 --> 00:19:39,435
when you think because he's like he's

563
00:19:39,465 --> 00:19:40,425
owed a murder now

564
00:19:42,212 --> 00:19:43,815
anyway one for me went to jail

565
00:19:43,905 --> 00:19:45,885
i think when you didn't mail marine

566
00:19:45,885 --> 00:19:46,725

567
00:19:46,725 --> 00:19:48,435

568
00:19:48,435 --> 00:19:49,455
don't know that there's an amount of

569
00:19:49,455 --> 00:19:50,865
money that would be worth lou really

570
00:19:50,865 --> 00:19:52,155
so in my life even if it

571
00:19:52,155 --> 00:19:55,605

one multi-campus single cam are weird to

684
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:22,290
say because there are multiple cameras and

685
00:23:22,290 --> 00:23:24,630
single canvas will they shorten multiple and

686
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:26,100
make it multiway are they not show

687
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:27,959
shortening single and calling it sing kam

688
00:23:27,959 --> 00:23:30,090

689
00:23:30,090 --> 00:23:33,600

00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,350
with another couple last night and the

693
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,330
the wife and the other couple is

694
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:47,160
not in show business and so we

695
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,379
were talking about um you know the

696
00:23:49,379 --> 00:23:49,950
single town

697
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:52,980
huh exactly is that what do you

698
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:55,020
do all day i just had a

699
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:58,230
baby who died she was asking us

700
00:23:58,290 --> 00:24:00,870
the difference between single cam and multicam

701
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:02,580
why do they call them that idiot

702
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:04,110
and we were trying to explain and

703
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:05,160
she like but wait

704
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:08,580
she couldn't it was she was having

705
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:11,580
a hard time understanding what what what

706
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,189
like why why are some shows multicam

707
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:15,420
and why are some shows single cam

708
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:17,520
yeah like if it's a comedy what's

709
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:20,273
the difference between why you shoot it

710
00:24:20,273 --> 00:24:21,390
in front of an audience why you

711
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:24,030
don't it also doesn't even make sense

712
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:25,500
any more because shows like you know

713
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:26,340
parenthood for exam

714
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:28,230
people use two or three cameras when

715
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:29,970
they're shooting the scenes it's true well

716
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,370
that's the dirty secret isn't it yeah

717
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:34,440
we usually use more than one count

718
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:37,470
oh my gosh anyway so i'm working

719
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:39,090

972
00:33:47,865 --> 00:33:49,035
like looking

973
00:33:49,065 --> 00:33:50,385

down like we're here to pick up

975
00:33:51,406 --> 00:33:53,021

stress and people are looking at us

978
00:33:56,385 --> 00:33:58,815
really weird who worked there and i

979
00:33:58,845 --> 00:34:02,325
go i think something's wrong and they

980
00:34:02,475 --> 00:34:04,545
the doctor came out and said you

981
00:34:04,545 --> 00:34:06,825
know people don the mask right

982
00:34:08,025 --> 00:34:09,075
it had a dog face on it

983
00:34:10,245 --> 00:34:12,015
i talked like rocky and he's like

984
00:34:12,075 --> 00:34:15,881
remember me i'm dead now is you're

985
00:34:15,881 --> 00:34:19,305
like why that just happened that doctors

986
00:34:19,305 --> 00:34:21,585

right away

991
00:34:30,345 --> 00:34:32,775
i think she admits now that it

992
00:34:32,775 --> 00:34:36,225
was purely a grief move and purely

993
00:34:36,225 --> 00:34:38,955
just extremely common right and i was

994
00:34:38,955 --> 00:34:40,785
like not ready for it and so

995
00:34:41,205 --> 00:34:42,585
but in that four months i was

996
00:34:42,585 --> 00:34:44,505
kind of like god i can i

slim sorry she's crying

1009
00:35:10,695 --> 00:35:11,835
well i tweeted about it because she

1011
00:35:14,145 --> 00:35:17,625
of like oh all the time at

1012
00:35:17,625 --> 00:35:19,004
night and it was so annoying when

1013
00:35:19,004 --> 00:35:20,535
people were like the amount of tweets

1014
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:22,785
i got that were like terrifying you

1015
00:35:22,785 --> 00:35:25,425
know diagnoses it was like she's gone

1016
00:35:25,425 --> 00:35:27,405
blind and she can't see ny anymore

1017
00:35:27,405 --> 00:35:29,038
and she's scared and she's meow and

1018
00:35:29,055 --> 00:35:30,195
it's like until i was like maybe

1019
00:35:30,195 --> 00:35:30,735
she's deaf

1020
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:32,865
and i know people like shelly cashman

1021
00:35:33,375 --> 00:35:35,445
well lumi and dementia that she like

1022
00:35:35,448 --> 00:35:36,855
to know what's going on and i

1023
00:35:36,856 --> 00:35:39,435
was like to mitch doesn't feel true

1024
00:35:39,465 --> 00:35:40,935
just based on my interactions with her

1025
00:35:41,385 --> 00:35:43,305
when i had the whales i think

1026
00:35:43,305 --> 00:35:45,075
what it really is yeah

1027
00:35:46,395 --> 00:35:48,105
yea and they're mice

1028
00:35:50,482 --> 00:35:53,205
the mice from sierra derby

1029
00:35:54,435 --> 00:35:57,345
i think um she just really likes

1030
00:35:57,345 --> 00:35:59,115
attention and night when i'm asleep and

1031
00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:00,165
she wants me to note sir

1032
00:36:00,885 --> 00:36:03,345
but that's a recent experience like i've

1033
00:36:03,345 --> 00:36:05,535
noticed that more recently but i think

1034
00:36:05,895 --> 00:36:07,035
one thing i did was like i

1035
00:36:07,035 --> 00:36:08,595
usually close the door to this one

1036
00:36:08,595 --> 00:36:09,645
part of my house and i left

1037
00:36:09,645 --> 00:36:11,085
it open and now she like can

1038
00:36:11,085 --> 00:36:12,315
go there and i think that's part

1039
00:36:12,315 --> 00:36:13,305
of it she didn't beat a different

1040
00:36:13,305 --> 00:36:14,865
space okay and then the other thing

1041
00:36:14,865 --> 00:36:17,325
is i think she's always thirsty but

1042
00:36:17,385 --> 00:36:19,334
i thirsty i've noticed that about her

1043
00:36:19,335 --> 00:36:20,805
just general thirsty bitch but

1044
00:36:21,225 --> 00:36:23,055
um have you ever had cats no

1045
00:36:23,115 --> 00:36:24,615
never be okay to them they like

1046
00:36:24,615 --> 00:36:25,725
to drink out of the tub and

1047
00:36:25,725 --> 00:36:27,522
sink is so gross and so my

1048
00:36:27,555 --> 00:36:29,235
wow think i turn the tub on

1049
00:36:29,235 --> 00:36:30,585
like all the time for her and

1050
00:36:30,585 --> 00:36:31,905
she drinks out of it but like

1051
00:36:32,115 --> 00:36:34,245
lately what's been happening is she drinks

1052
00:36:34,245 --> 00:36:37,215

00:37:49,785 --> 00:37:52,485
you what true of my old catalogs

1093
00:37:52,485 --> 00:37:55,005
be twenty one and this cat is

1094
00:37:55,005 --> 00:37:56,595
thirteen so and she's an indoor cat

1095
00:37:56,595 --> 00:37:56,925
so she's

1096
00:37:56,985 --> 00:37:58,965
i got like another seven years i

1097
00:37:58,965 --> 00:38:01,881

1098
00:38:02,085 --> 00:38:03,765
it could go you know however but

1099
00:38:04,335 --> 00:38:06,735
they have you got yeah probably seven

1100
00:38:06,735 --> 00:38:08,775
more years sign a coyote again she

1101
00:38:08,775 --> 00:38:11,295
gets it out um my my whole

1102
00:38:11,295 --> 00:38:12,855
point is just that i have thought

1103
00:38:12,855 --> 00:38:14,565
when she dies it might be nice

1104
00:38:14,565 --> 00:38:15,885
to not have to clean the litter

1105
00:38:15,885 --> 00:38:17,085
and think about right

1106
00:38:17,115 --> 00:38:18,347
hair and like all the things that

1107
00:38:18,347 --> 00:38:19,305
i could deal with all the time

1108
00:38:19,755 --> 00:38:21,345
and ah but then i also think

1109
00:38:21,345 --> 00:38:23,175
i'll probably get another pet like i

1110
00:38:23,295 --> 00:38:25,395
just like having animals around when i'm

1111
00:38:25,395 --> 00:38:27,525
away i really it's very nice sum

1112
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:29,355
it is tradeoff it's like you know

1113
00:38:29,385 --> 00:38:31,755
the what you get for all having

1114
00:38:31,755 --> 00:38:33,435
to do all those things yeah because

1115
00:38:33,502 --> 00:38:35,745

is the picture to us from as

1195
00:41:31,175 --> 00:41:32,375
a suggestion this we'll give them a

1196
00:41:32,375 --> 00:41:34,895
little bit of street cred at two

1197
00:41:34,895 --> 00:41:37,175
headed blah thank you i'll come on

1198
00:41:37,175 --> 00:41:39,185
that's not a real name this is

1199
00:41:39,185 --> 00:41:40,595
the movie game it's a game where

1200
00:41:40,595 --> 00:41:42,515
where one person says an actor the

1201
00:41:42,515 --> 00:41:44,495
next person says a movie that actors

1202
00:41:44,495 --> 00:41:47,195
in the following person says another actor

1203
00:41:47,195 --> 00:41:49,055
from that movie and then the next

1204
00:41:49,055 --> 00:41:50,795
person doesn't a movie that that actors

1205
00:41:50,795 --> 00:41:52,505
in so on and so forth until

1206
00:41:52,505 --> 00:41:54,215
hopefully you can expect the original movie

1207
00:41:54,215 --> 00:41:55,505
at the end here's the thing whoever

1208
00:41:55,505 --> 00:41:59,105
connects back wins and whoever can't come

1209
00:41:59,105 --> 00:42:00,185
up with all done just put on

1210
00:42:00,185 --> 00:42:00,755
the song plays

1211
00:42:00,785 --> 00:42:02,825
if we're gonna make okay super okay

1212
00:42:02,825 --> 00:42:05,615
years yeah these new rules okay clinic

1213
00:42:05,645 --> 00:42:07,475
cause he said and so you're trying

1214
00:42:07,505 --> 00:42:10,360
there it's sort of two-prong tell me

1215
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:13,115
again you're trying to trap the next

1216
00:42:13,115 --> 00:42:14,525
person they don't wish so that they

1217
00:42:14,555 --> 00:42:16,295
can't come up with an answer and

1218
00:42:16,295 --> 00:42:18,665
if that happens they're out but you're

1219
00:42:18,665 --> 00:42:20,195
also trying to make sure that the

1220
00:42:20,435 --> 00:42:20,855
person

1221
00:42:20,915 --> 00:42:22,535
can't link back to the original movie

1222
00:42:22,535 --> 00:42:24,275
because if they do that they will

1223
00:42:25,205 --> 00:42:26,615
say something was up paying attention because

1224
00:42:26,615 --> 00:42:28,955
i was dancing theme i caught him

1225
00:42:28,955 --> 00:42:30,185
at the end and i thought it'll

1226
00:42:30,185 --> 00:42:31,925
make sense when we are sure i'd

1227
00:42:31,925 --> 00:42:33,845
also you're trying you're going to carry

1228

person meet with an easy one when

1230
00:42:37,205 --> 00:42:38,975
you give an answer you're trying to

1231
00:42:39,335 --> 00:42:40,805
knock them out because if they can't

1232
00:42:40,805 --> 00:42:41,075

1411
00:50:10,325 --> 00:50:11,525

00:50:12,305 --> 00:50:13,925
and had a great always worth but

1413
00:50:13,925 --> 00:50:15,455

you having fun are you having any

1415
00:50:18,305 --> 00:50:20,165
fun i mean look the thing about

1416
00:50:20,165 --> 00:50:21,515
exercise is if you get in the

1417
00:50:21,515 --> 00:50:23,045
habit of it no but he was

1418
00:50:23,045 --> 00:50:26,465

where he was like super jacked but

1420
00:50:28,505 --> 00:50:29,735
here's the thing if you get super

1422
00:50:31,655 --> 00:50:32,135
ness

1423
00:50:32,225 --> 00:50:33,965

1424
00:50:33,965 --> 00:50:35,915
guess every woman wanted to fuck him

1425
00:50:35,915 --> 00:50:38,345

1426
00:50:38,345 --> 00:50:39,515
i could do it i bet he

1427
00:50:39,515 --> 00:50:41,735
probably liked looking in the mirror i

1428
00:50:41,975 --> 00:50:44,675

1506
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:29,930
the past six weeks and having working

six days this week

1512
00:53:39,620 --> 00:53:42,110
yeah but but like i feel like

1513
00:53:42,110 --> 00:53:43,880
a commitment to doing that is at

1514
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:45,920
least two and a half something like

1515
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:47,360
that and yeah the thing you gotta

1516
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:48,980
do with a trainer it's like yeah

1517
00:53:48,980 --> 00:53:51,366
i love sugar i love candy yeah

1518
00:53:51,366 --> 00:53:52,610
it's really hard for you to not

1519
00:53:52,610 --> 00:53:53,780
eat i feel like i'm doing it

1520
00:53:53,780 --> 00:53:55,460
just so i can eat sugar and

1521
00:53:55,460 --> 00:53:57,080
drink wine and shit like that like

1522
00:53:57,080 --> 00:53:58,280
i'm you know i'm not doing any

1523
00:53:58,310 --> 00:53:59,480
good if you want

1524
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:02,600
get jacked like that you that requires

1525
00:54:02,630 --> 00:54:05,480
a um that's like such a commitment

1526
00:54:05,540 --> 00:54:07,880
rub your your whole life where you

1527
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:10,550
are thinking about that well i mean

1528
00:54:10,820 --> 00:54:12,530
obviously when you start you're thinking about

1529
00:54:12,530 --> 00:54:14,120
it all the time i mean to

1530
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:15,260
get to the point where it's second

1531
00:54:15,260 --> 00:54:17,404
nature where like i eat these things

1532
00:54:17,404 --> 00:54:19,400
and you you're not actually thinking about

1533
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:19,640
what i

1534
00:54:19,670 --> 00:54:21,380
can't eat i hear this is what

1535
00:54:21,380 --> 00:54:22,370
i will eat and i got there

1536
00:54:22,370 --> 00:54:24,320
for the tv show which i do

1537
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:25,580
for five years and then i would

1538
00:54:25,580 --> 00:54:27,410
let it lapse in between seasons and

1539
00:54:27,410 --> 00:54:29,390
be really bummed and then like have

1540
00:54:29,390 --> 00:54:30,470
to like get back down to a

1541
00:54:30,470 --> 00:54:32,030
waiter whatever but like once you're in

1542
00:54:32,030 --> 00:54:33,260
that headspace of like oh no i

1543
00:54:33,260 --> 00:54:35,930
don't eat that it's yeah yeah but

1544
00:54:35,930 --> 00:54:36,860
i just think it would be fun

1545
00:54:36,860 --> 00:54:39,140
to do for a role you know

1546
00:54:39,170 --> 00:54:39,800
yeah just like

1547
00:54:39,986 --> 00:54:41,390
just do it for one movie and

1548
00:54:41,390 --> 00:54:42,890
then go like oh fuck thank god

1549
00:54:42,890 --> 00:54:44,810
like anyone times there's like a constraint

1550
00:54:44,810 --> 00:54:46,040
that's put on you and like in

1551
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:47,840
a way that makes you healthier because

1552
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:49,670
like good like oh i can't do

1553
00:54:49,670 --> 00:54:50,900
this thing for this whole time because

1554
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:53,180
of this greater purpose or something it's

1555
00:54:53,180 --> 00:54:54,890
great like i feel like even just

1556
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:56,960
like when i'm working i don't drink

1557
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:58,700
as much i don't yeah wow wow

1558
00:54:58,880 --> 00:54:59,960
well i just i went

1559
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:01,280
ain't for a physical for the first

1560
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:02,930
time in a couple years and went

1561
00:55:02,930 --> 00:55:04,850
to a new doctor and as i'm

1562
00:55:04,850 --> 00:55:06,470
like going and i'm thinking oh i

1563
00:55:06,470 --> 00:55:07,520
hope he gives me a lot of

1564
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:10,550
restrictions yeah because then it's slide would

1565
00:55:10,550 --> 00:55:11,870
like to have some structure to my

1566
00:55:11,990 --> 00:55:13,370
life because then it's like well like

1567
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:16,040
i i can't backslide on this that

1568
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:17,480
or whatever like i just started going

1569
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:19,132
back to the gym the last couple

1570
00:55:19,132 --> 00:55:20,120
of months and i used to

1571
00:55:20,155 --> 00:55:22,040
be really good about it and then

1572
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:24,470
i had um you know i had

1573
00:55:24,590 --> 00:55:27,290
about of depression which first of all

1574
00:55:27,290 --> 00:55:29,210
that that affects your motivation but then

1575
00:55:29,210 --> 00:55:31,640
also then you get a medication which

1576
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:33,560
causes you to gain weight yeah and

1577
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:35,240
then it's like it's a whole thing

1578
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:37,130
so now i'm in a good place

1579
00:55:37,130 --> 00:55:38,510
where i'm trying to take care of

1580
00:55:38,510 --> 00:55:40,220
myself again you know saying

1581
00:55:40,310 --> 00:55:41,360
man would be great if the doctor

1582
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:42,890
said here's what you have to do

1583
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:44,720
yeah you can't do these things anymore

1584
00:55:44,750 --> 00:55:46,700
i will say i a couple years

1585
00:55:46,700 --> 00:55:47,870
ago i went to the document oh

1586
00:55:47,870 --> 00:55:49,970
i could just do them so much

1587
00:55:49,970 --> 00:55:52,160
harder yeah but i went to the

1588
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:54,140
doctor and was told like oh you

1589
00:55:54,140 --> 00:55:56,360
have to have this type of diet

1590
00:55:56,360 --> 00:55:58,400
which is like yeah it's one of

1591
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:00,110
the just all protein diets and you

1592
00:56:00,110 --> 00:56:00,440
have to lie

1593
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:02,960
like have no carbs and stuff like

1594
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:04,160
that yeah and i try and i

1595
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:05,479
did it for six months i was

1596
00:56:05,479 --> 00:56:07,790
just like i wanna kill myself yeah

1597
00:56:07,820 --> 00:56:09,170
it's just not i mean if i

1598
00:56:09,170 --> 00:56:10,250
was doing for a role it would

1599
00:56:10,250 --> 00:56:12,620
be fine so yeah wow because i

1600
00:56:12,620 --> 00:56:14,210
was getting my food delivered so i

1601
00:56:14,210 --> 00:56:15,380
have yes stay on it and all

1602
00:56:15,380 --> 00:56:16,820
that stuff but it was just like

1603
00:56:16,850 --> 00:56:19,190
i just life sucks you know but

1604
00:56:19,190 --> 00:56:20,540
i will say and

1605
00:56:20,630 --> 00:56:22,490
maybe this is too print no i

1606
00:56:22,490 --> 00:56:23,840
think i can talk about but so

1607
00:56:23,870 --> 00:56:28,070
my father is like can't eat anymore

1608
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:28,910
i don't know if i've told you

1609
00:56:28,910 --> 00:56:30,470
this you've mentioned it but yeah it

1610
00:56:30,470 --> 00:56:33,470
was on so he can't eat so

1611
00:56:34,670 --> 00:56:36,951
so he he basically has the the

1612
00:56:37,070 --> 00:56:39,350
like a liquid diet that he puts

1613
00:56:39,350 --> 00:56:41,960
into a tube into his stomach so

1614
00:56:42,080 --> 00:56:43,580
and this is a recent like over

1615
00:56:43,580 --> 00:56:45,320
the past couple of years and i

1616
00:56:45,320 --> 00:56:47,090
was and he was just kind of

1617
00:56:47,090 --> 00:56:49,280
saying like well you know like you

1618
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:50,450
think it's not gonna be worth it

1619
00:56:50,450 --> 00:56:51,980
but it's like well you wanna live

1620
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,710
right now your other and you'd rather

1621
00:56:54,710 --> 00:56:57,170
not die absolutely right you know so

1622
00:56:57,230 --> 00:57:00,080
yeah i find with with things that

1623
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:02,390
i have to cut out it's usually

1624
00:57:02,390 --> 00:57:05,270
like no i don't know two weeks

1625
00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:07,280
to maybe a month to lose the

1626
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:09,260
taste of the thing yeah whether it's

1627
00:57:09,260 --> 00:57:11,360
alcohol or sweets or bread or whatever

1628
00:57:11,390 --> 00:57:12,710
right but

1629
00:57:13,160 --> 00:57:16,310
the first little taste of it um

1630
00:57:16,370 --> 00:57:18,860
fucking back yeah see i shouldn't i

1631
00:57:18,973 --> 00:57:22,040
i stopped drinking a coke and like

1632
00:57:22,100 --> 00:57:25,100
any pop when i was in college

1633
00:57:25,130 --> 00:57:26,690
freshman college and i had to take

1634
00:57:27,020 --> 00:57:28,190
things so it feels like a lie

1635
00:57:28,670 --> 00:57:31,040
of listeners from all over yeah they

1636
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:32,510
know what i'm talking about family but

1637
00:57:32,510 --> 00:57:33,320
i used to drink it all

1638
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:34,700
the time i drink so much coke

1639
00:57:34,700 --> 00:57:36,140
and whatever all mountain dew all that

1640
00:57:36,170 --> 00:57:37,460
crap like growing up a ton of

1641
00:57:37,460 --> 00:57:39,440
it loved it stopped because i was

1642
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:41,780
getting headaches and i've never had it

1643
00:57:41,780 --> 00:57:43,190

1644
00:57:43,190 --> 00:57:45,260
of coke like a couple times last

1645
00:57:45,290 --> 00:57:49,040

00:57:49,100 --> 00:57:51,560
insane to me now yeah everyone's wrong

1647
00:57:51,590 --> 00:57:52,645

1649
00:57:53,480 --> 00:57:56,180
good well i said i'm so serbian

1650
00:57:56,390 --> 00:57:59,240
i started having regular coke maybe six

1651
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:00,650
years ago or something i would only

1652
00:58:00,650 --> 00:58:02,480
have diet and anytime ever i take

1653
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:04,100

00:58:04,130 --> 00:58:06,500
eighties horrible to me too yeah but

1655
00:58:06,740 --> 00:58:08,840
the but like not having it all

1656
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:09,980
makes me think like okay well if

1657
00:58:09,980 --> 00:58:12,530
i completely cut out my reese's peanut

1658
00:58:12,530 --> 00:58:13,640

00:58:14,150 --> 00:58:16,670
your turn my turn just right in

1660
00:58:16,670 --> 00:58:18,170
front of reese's egg so it looks

1661
00:58:18,170 --> 00:58:21,260
like a big shit but i i

1662
00:58:21,350 --> 00:58:23,120
if i stopped what i'd be like

1663
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:25,310

00:58:25,310 --> 00:58:26,990
same way well i say they say

1665
00:58:26,990 --> 00:58:31,130
