have this thing in my head where

130
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:08,640
i sometimes think philos

131
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,750
adelphia is a state

132
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,270
like i just it just sounds like

133
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:14,520
one it does it's it's almost more

134
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,410
famous than pennsylvania you know like how

135
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:18,660
much other stuff in pennsylvania thursday of

136
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:21,180
course like paper okay chinese is a

137
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:23,910
long rating is pretty low what's q

138
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:24,390
rating

139
00:05:25,683 --> 00:05:26,850

00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:32,190
pittsburgh in penn or philadelphia or like

142
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:34,710
more famous than pennsylvania yeah i think

143
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:36,660
i think it should be pennsylvania philadelphia

144
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:38,430
it's not one of those places that

145
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:40,830
has a state identity you're right and

146
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:42,810
like new jersey as a state identity

147
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:45,300

00:21:17,085 --> 00:21:18,675
around we all got the zombies now

581
00:21:18,675 --> 00:21:21,165
i'm tired there's one right though it's

582
00:21:21,165 --> 00:21:22,725
a three-way tie we broke that ribbon

583
00:21:22,725 --> 00:21:23,895
at the same time well yeah so

584
00:21:23,895 --> 00:21:25,005
cool i was holding out a ribbon

585
00:21:25,035 --> 00:21:26,445
with two hands it was actually kind

586
00:21:26,445 --> 00:21:27,405
of tricky how she was doing because

587
00:21:27,405 --> 00:21:28,575
we just ran right into it i

588
00:21:28,575 --> 00:21:30,495
felt bad yeah yeah she we knocked

589
00:21:30,495 --> 00:21:32,415
out over teeth i know she's dealing

590
00:21:32,415 --> 00:21:34,485
with it now and i'm not too

591
00:21:34,485 --> 00:21:37,875
worried you weren't either there's your problem

592
00:21:38,145 --> 00:21:39,705
no and she seemed to find she

593
00:21:39,705 --> 00:21:40,875
really you know she didn't wanna make

594
00:21:40,875 --> 00:21:42,015
it our problem yeah they're the two

595
00:21:42,015 --> 00:21:43,785
front teeth which are the easiest replace

596
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:45,082
from what i understand why

597
00:21:45,195 --> 00:21:46,935
i think that is um you can

598
00:21:46,965 --> 00:21:48,465
order them in bulk so the dentist

599
00:21:48,465 --> 00:21:50,775
has a bunch of miniature got it

600
00:21:51,585 --> 00:21:53,625
and they're just chick that's right yeah

601
00:21:57,315 --> 00:21:58,515
the good thing about using chocolates for

602
00:21:58,515 --> 00:22:00,165
teeth is that when your brothers paddy

603
00:22:00,165 --> 00:22:02,652
just chew your teeth exactly yeah and

604
00:22:02,652 --> 00:22:03,885
then you just replace them with is

605
00:22:03,885 --> 00:22:05,265
cheap when i was a kid i

606
00:22:05,265 --> 00:22:07,395

i think i'm probably just earth but

633
00:22:59,235 --> 00:23:00,765
yeah we'll see i don't think neil

634
00:23:00,765 --> 00:23:02,265
armstrong ever started when he was on

635
00:23:02,265 --> 00:23:04,575
the moon he might surprise me if

636
00:23:04,575 --> 00:23:06,855
they if you wanted a crispy sandwich

637
00:23:07,335 --> 00:23:08,625
when you get back in the ruck

638
00:23:08,955 --> 00:23:12,075
mission control the music control do you

639
00:23:12,075 --> 00:23:13,215

another rocket up there with a crispy

642
00:23:17,085 --> 00:23:18,765
sandwich to you and instead of saying

643
00:23:18,765 --> 00:23:20,205
yes he said crispy

644
00:23:21,615 --> 00:23:23,205
like it doesn't make sense that's right

645
00:23:23,205 --> 00:23:24,703
he asked his acres yeah he asked

646
00:23:24,703 --> 00:23:26,355

648
00:23:27,765 --> 00:23:28,815

about him still being up there do

652
00:23:33,585 --> 00:23:34,965
i know because it's so it looks

653
00:23:34,965 --> 00:23:36,915
over because we never brought him down

654
00:23:36,975 --> 00:23:39,165

00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:45,945
would be accusations from mentoring about this

659
00:23:45,945 --> 00:23:47,925
they thought they brought him back and

660
00:23:47,925 --> 00:23:49,275
when they looked back in the backseat

661
00:23:49,275 --> 00:23:52,965

i said great i went in she

739
00:26:08,715 --> 00:26:09,825
do i wanna hear your theory because

740
00:26:09,825 --> 00:26:11,385
i think i know what happened okay

741
00:26:11,505 --> 00:26:13,215
okay you what did she did repair

742
00:26:13,215 --> 00:26:14,685
the pants she didn't agree and they

743
00:26:14,685 --> 00:26:16,395
looked so cute my theory

744
00:26:16,425 --> 00:26:19,155
is that she didn't know what to

745
00:26:19,155 --> 00:26:23,745
do because she thought the pants were

746
00:26:23,745 --> 00:26:25,845
for you and she thought she's like

747
00:26:25,845 --> 00:26:28,305
prowled never yeah get elastic big enough

748
00:26:28,305 --> 00:26:30,795
she's yeah yeah how can she can

749
00:26:30,795 --> 00:26:33,375
try to enhance got her foot yeah

750
00:26:33,375 --> 00:26:35,715
and then then one day she happened

751
00:26:35,715 --> 00:26:36,465
to see you

752
00:26:36,555 --> 00:26:39,105
pushing hollywood stroll yeah and it all

753
00:26:39,105 --> 00:26:41,145
made sense yeah the first time i

754
00:26:41,145 --> 00:26:42,135
came in i didn't have holly the

755
00:26:42,135 --> 00:26:43,215
second time i came and i did

756
00:26:43,215 --> 00:26:45,855
have hall yes okay oh scholar yeah

757
00:26:46,365 --> 00:26:48,585
um what's your theory my theory is

758
00:26:48,585 --> 00:26:50,115
she thought they were brown and she

759
00:26:50,115 --> 00:26:51,795
was saying they were brown like she

760
00:26:51,795 --> 00:26:53,806
remembered them as being brown she sent

761
00:26:53,806 --> 00:26:55,065
them off in a bag to somebody

762
00:26:55,065 --> 00:26:56,535
else to do it she kept saying

763
00:26:56,535 --> 00:26:56,685
look

764
00:26:56,715 --> 00:26:57,975
for the brown pants they couldn't find

765
00:26:57,975 --> 00:26:59,805
them i called the day before she

766
00:26:59,925 --> 00:27:01,845
looked for the poppy but david ortiz

767
00:27:01,845 --> 00:27:03,585
if the day before she called me

768
00:27:03,585 --> 00:27:05,565
back i called her and said i'm

769
00:27:05,565 --> 00:27:07,065
looking for those pants they're red they're

770
00:27:07,065 --> 00:27:08,415
a little pants or red pants like

771
00:27:08,415 --> 00:27:10,575
red red red then she next issue

772
00:27:10,815 --> 00:27:12,735
oh i bet she's colorblind she thought

773
00:27:12,735 --> 00:27:14,625
they were brown and popeye blood what

774
00:27:14,715 --> 00:27:16,875
is the directly or a dog yeah

775
00:27:16,935 --> 00:27:19,785
oh yeah and she licks them clean

776
00:27:19,785 --> 00:27:21,042
but somehow drive if you want to

777
00:27:21,042 --> 00:27:23,175
see the man well because they're dying

778
00:27:23,175 --> 00:27:27,132
rather i didn't realize these republic pants

779
00:27:27,132 --> 00:27:31,095
i didn't really cute they're very oh

780
00:27:31,305 --> 00:27:32,895
do we get handed these down she

781
00:27:32,895 --> 00:27:34,594
has so many ah you could borrow

782
00:27:34,594 --> 00:27:36,735
em oh i want him back you

783
00:27:36,735 --> 00:27:37,035
will have

784
00:27:37,082 --> 00:27:38,835
to go through the same process that

785
00:27:38,835 --> 00:27:40,485
lauren went through popeye pants in a

786
00:27:40,485 --> 00:27:42,075
neat t-shirt yeah i know she's really

787
00:27:42,075 --> 00:27:44,355
killing it that day wow she's already

788
00:27:44,355 --> 00:27:45,225
wearing that when i got home from

789
00:27:45,225 --> 00:27:46,665
the dry cleaner i said good let's

790
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:49,335
get these pants on i think it

791
00:27:49,545 --> 00:27:52,245
emmys emmy feels enormous to me where

792
00:27:52,245 --> 00:27:54,075
she's wearing one year old is she

793
00:27:54,075 --> 00:27:55,815
wearing one year old thinks oh my

794
00:27:55,815 --> 00:27:57,165
god i hope she's a big

795
00:27:57,225 --> 00:27:59,715
fat baby she's so i don't mean

796
00:27:59,745 --> 00:28:01,245
i don't mean fat necessarily just mean

797
00:28:01,245 --> 00:28:02,685
she saw i mean she seems a

798
00:28:02,685 --> 00:28:04,755
big she's yeah i mean she might

799
00:28:04,755 --> 00:28:05,955
be i don't know do you think

800
00:28:05,955 --> 00:28:08,235
charlie was in the ninety eighth percentile

801
00:28:08,235 --> 00:28:11,415
for at least eight songs head she

802
00:28:11,445 --> 00:28:13,635
really that mean again i'm ninety one

803
00:28:13,755 --> 00:28:16,335
it's bigger than ninety eight percent of

804
00:28:16,365 --> 00:28:17,355
other kids like out

805
00:28:17,355 --> 00:28:19,605
of one hundred kids only two would

806
00:28:19,605 --> 00:28:20,535
have a bigger head than home

807
00:28:22,905 --> 00:28:25,455
or be taller or whatever right i

808
00:28:25,455 --> 00:28:27,345
believe that's how i would explain percentile

809
00:28:27,375 --> 00:28:29,055
wow i've never known what it meant

810
00:28:29,145 --> 00:28:30,495
i guess i just yeah i guess

811
00:28:30,495 --> 00:28:32,085
i've just come to that conclusion that's

812
00:28:32,085 --> 00:28:33,375
why i think it means okay yeah

813
00:28:33,735 --> 00:28:35,955
yeah because i mean is is in

814
00:28:35,955 --> 00:28:38,385
the nineties on height and weight yeah

815
00:28:38,385 --> 00:28:40,905
but eighties first for ahead which i

816
00:28:40,905 --> 00:28:41,505
think is good because

817
00:28:41,625 --> 00:28:43,125
been seeing a lot of like big-headed

818
00:28:43,125 --> 00:28:45,405
babies out there yay what industry when

819
00:28:45,405 --> 00:28:46,725
do we stop measuring things like that

820
00:28:46,875 --> 00:28:48,585
but do i know what percentiles wherein

821
00:28:48,705 --> 00:28:50,535
we shall measure each other's heads yeah

822
00:28:50,565 --> 00:28:53,265
because at this point right get a

823
00:28:53,265 --> 00:28:54,285
big protractor

824
00:28:55,935 --> 00:28:57,165
i found out that i have kind

825
00:28:57,165 --> 00:28:58,125
of a bigger head than i thought

826
00:28:58,125 --> 00:28:59,835
because i bought this hat online and

827
00:28:59,835 --> 00:29:01,875
then it was hat sizes one way

828
00:29:01,875 --> 00:29:04,215
to do yeah it required a measurement

829
00:29:04,275 --> 00:29:05,325
to pick out which size and i

830
00:29:05,325 --> 00:29:06,825
was like yeah i have no idea

831
00:29:06,825 --> 00:29:07,931
which one i mean i know what

832
00:29:07,931 --> 00:29:09,135
my hat size is but i don't

833
00:29:09,135 --> 00:29:11,254
know what percentile but i mean oh

834
00:29:11,273 --> 00:29:13,785
that's a big head yeah it's technically

835
00:29:13,785 --> 00:29:15,645
it's a large yeah because because you're

836
00:29:15,650 --> 00:29:15,855
going to

837
00:29:15,915 --> 00:29:17,325
if you are hats but i had

838
00:29:17,325 --> 00:29:20,115
two small ahead was that too maybe

839
00:29:20,145 --> 00:29:21,615
mine was mine was bigger than yours

840
00:29:21,615 --> 00:29:22,905
i feel like i think so minus

841
00:29:22,905 --> 00:29:25,755
seven and three eighths yeah i'm ah

842
00:29:25,785 --> 00:29:27,615
oh i feel like she wants to

843
00:29:27,645 --> 00:29:29,175
reach up to tie your hair off

844
00:29:29,175 --> 00:29:30,645

it was bigger than average i guess

855
00:29:52,845 --> 00:29:54,195
we were not average it just meant

856
00:29:54,195 --> 00:29:55,395
that i had to get the medium

857
00:29:55,395 --> 00:29:56,835

the temperature yes yeah yeah yeah yeah

1029
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,020

1030
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:55,700
raises your body temperature so it low

1031
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:57,710
lowers it actually does it read yeah

1329
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:26,510

if i ask the other mirror

1427
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:31,490
if i ask the feeling this is

1428
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:33,230
you're trying to game the system instead

1429
00:50:33,230 --> 00:50:35,900

1430
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:37,340

going round we'll see what happens let's

1449
00:51:18,462 --> 00:51:19,510
