was a kid in

416
00:14:36,365 --> 00:14:38,675
syndication i want to i feel i

417
00:14:38,705 --> 00:14:41,105
maybe ten years ago i started watching

418
00:14:41,285 --> 00:14:43,355
the pilot because i was like i

419
00:14:43,355 --> 00:14:44,705
gotta get back into this and it

420
00:14:44,705 --> 00:14:46,055
was so slow those

421
00:14:47,495 --> 00:14:49,925

00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:52,805
this part sounds

423

that elect that sounds different to me

424
00:14:57,575 --> 00:14:59,855
that synthesized part sound can i guess

425
00:14:59,855 --> 00:15:01,115
what it's about based on the name

426
00:15:01,115 --> 00:15:01,685
and the setup

427
00:15:02,795 --> 00:15:05,525
it's about monica blair yeah zaki background

428
00:15:05,525 --> 00:15:06,845
of threw me off i sort of

429
00:15:06,845 --> 00:15:08,495
like my first thought was it's like

430
00:15:08,525 --> 00:15:11,495
exiles it's like aliens oh like okay

431
00:15:11,495 --> 00:15:13,985
rockford files like some detectives files music

432
00:15:14,015 --> 00:15:14,465
cowboy

433
00:15:15,515 --> 00:15:18,125
yeah he sort of he's nice james

434
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:19,745
garner and he's kinda has a cowboy

435
00:15:20,255 --> 00:15:20,585
vibe

436
00:15:21,425 --> 00:15:23,945
he's a p yeah okay great yeah

437
00:15:24,005 --> 00:15:25,865
he's kind of like a downtrodden guy

438
00:15:25,955 --> 00:15:27,536
yeah yeah like lives in a trailer

439
00:15:27,815 --> 00:15:29,825
yeah disney um and the show would

440
00:15:29,855 --> 00:15:32,645
open with somebody leaving a message on

441
00:15:32,645 --> 00:15:34,775
his answering machine and it was always

442
00:15:34,775 --> 00:15:35,735
somebody who was kind of mad at

443
00:15:35,735 --> 00:15:37,715
him for some reason right and it

444
00:15:37,715 --> 00:15:39,785
was a different message every time so

445
00:15:39,785 --> 00:15:41,165
they had like this little cold omega

446
00:15:41,405 --> 00:15:43,475
it was always different yeah i did

447
00:15:43,475 --> 00:15:46,925
watch colombo pilot yeah and second episode

448
00:15:46,925 --> 00:15:50,555
recently colombo pilots wild itself cool up

449
00:15:50,555 --> 00:15:53,165
could not believe it she's like when

450
00:15:53,195 --> 00:15:55,295
this is the pilot when does colombo

451
00:15:55,325 --> 00:15:56,975
come in it was it it was

452
00:15:56,975 --> 00:15:59,105
minute nineteen yeah i would find any

453
00:15:59,465 --> 00:16:01,025
problem for a long time and then

454
00:16:01,145 --> 00:16:01,325
well

455
00:16:01,475 --> 00:16:04,115
because the gimmick was you see how

456
00:16:04,115 --> 00:16:06,785
the the the killer did it first

457
00:16:06,905 --> 00:16:09,155
oh and then colombo figures it out

458
00:16:09,935 --> 00:16:11,555
you know set out and you watch

459
00:16:11,555 --> 00:16:13,265
him figure it out with whatever you

460
00:16:13,265 --> 00:16:14,915
want on lot of the limb yeah

461
00:16:15,485 --> 00:16:16,925
you want and he doesn't watch already

462
00:16:16,925 --> 00:16:19,175
know right he he breaks like three

463
00:16:19,175 --> 00:16:21,275
eggs right and then touches everything in

464
00:16:21,275 --> 00:16:21,335
the

465
00:16:21,785 --> 00:16:25,745
so change was good she was losing

466
00:16:25,745 --> 00:16:27,635
her mind i get out of my

467
00:16:27,665 --> 00:16:30,755
kitchen colombo that's funky but he always

468
00:16:30,755 --> 00:16:32,555
is like it's funky he always shows

469
00:16:32,555 --> 00:16:34,595
up pretending trying that sort of nasty

470
00:16:34,595 --> 00:16:36,065
i just decided he always shows up

471
00:16:36,065 --> 00:16:37,535
pretending to like be there for a

472
00:16:37,535 --> 00:16:39,455
different reason yeah it was so he

473
00:16:39,455 --> 00:16:40,895
can grill the person so it's always

474
00:16:40,895 --> 00:16:41,645
like oh i was in

475
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:44,015

488
00:17:05,525 --> 00:17:06,695
the other thing why is took so

489
00:17:06,695 --> 00:17:09,035

i think it was one hundred dollars

496
00:17:19,655 --> 00:17:21,935
per half hour so and that's

497
00:17:21,965 --> 00:17:23,772
not bad this was pre residuals this

498
00:17:23,772 --> 00:17:25,475

499
00:17:25,475 --> 00:17:27,275

get paid to do the show and

508
00:17:41,765 --> 00:17:42,125
then they would

509
00:17:42,155 --> 00:17:43,325
pay him to watch the show that

510
00:17:43,655 --> 00:17:45,305

wish i had never said well i

762
00:26:19,125 --> 00:26:21,465

764
00:26:23,685 --> 00:26:26,175

movie so you could turn it off

771
00:26:36,255 --> 00:26:38,057
right before it that's the story and

772
00:26:38,057 --> 00:26:40,275

when i did early show and we

835
00:28:50,865 --> 00:28:53,565

836
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:56,385
in love really no it was the

837
00:28:56,385 --> 00:28:58,005
bit in the scene but he was

838
00:28:58,005 --> 00:29:00,015
so great i loved he was all

839
00:29:00,087 --> 00:29:03,285
so is he very passerine i need

840
00:29:03,285 --> 00:29:05,145
more details is he dressed as clara

841
00:29:05,145 --> 00:29:05,505
peller

842
00:29:06,975 --> 00:29:08,505
not that i could tell although to

843
00:29:08,505 --> 00:29:10,155

844
00:29:10,155 --> 00:29:11,325
up here and i was not looking

845
00:29:11,325 --> 00:29:13,035
down low is he has bad at

846
00:29:13,035 --> 00:29:14,775
delivering the line is clara peller was

847
00:29:15,195 --> 00:29:16,455
i think he's probably better at it

848
00:29:16,845 --> 00:29:20,715
he's he's charming he you know what's

849
00:29:20,715 --> 00:29:22,965
ironic he's a giant and yet he

850
00:29:22,965 --> 00:29:24,285
stands on the shoulders of a giant

851
00:29:24,315 --> 00:29:26,835
that's true repeller that's true and it's

person to represent the piss pigs and

859
00:29:45,765 --> 00:29:46,965

piss pig yeah in previous episodes she

931
00:31:58,525 --> 00:32:00,775
of course we talked about her career

932
00:32:00,775 --> 00:32:03,385
and we we realize she was a

933
00:32:03,385 --> 00:32:05,122
piss pig because of just everything about

934
00:32:05,127 --> 00:32:07,375
she just fits the description now of

935
00:32:07,375 --> 00:32:09,325
course she's passed on and she's in

936
00:32:09,325 --> 00:32:11,995

beautiful daughter she's a sensor deeper for

940
00:32:16,375 --> 00:32:18,115
like a few years purgatory is a

941
00:32:18,115 --> 00:32:19,825
long term and you think it's hundreds

942
00:32:19,825 --> 00:32:21,355
and hundreds yes you can be for

943
00:32:21,355 --> 00:32:23,785

00:37:40,375 --> 00:37:42,505
to be like davis generation thought that

1113
00:37:43,135 --> 00:37:44,845
wants to be like tick tock

1114
00:37:45,835 --> 00:37:47,515
and they want us to be lightly

1115
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:50,485
fast quick things guys because tiktok like

1116
00:37:50,605 --> 00:37:52,105
i don't dance it the dancing that

1117
00:37:52,105 --> 00:37:53,575
i see on tik hai taught you

1118
00:37:53,575 --> 00:37:55,045
about doing yeah it's all just above

1119
00:37:55,045 --> 00:37:56,665
the waist with people bopping so do

1120
00:37:56,665 --> 00:37:57,595
you know what it is do they

1121
00:37:57,595 --> 00:37:59,665
have this special technique and i don't

1122
00:37:59,965 --> 00:38:02,455
trust someone out there knows more um

1123
00:38:02,545 --> 00:38:05,215
but there's a camera sort of filter

1124
00:38:05,215 --> 00:38:05,965
or app or some

1125
00:38:05,965 --> 00:38:07,555
when you're using where it kind of

1126
00:38:07,555 --> 00:38:10,675
keeps the it keeps them centers sent

1127
00:38:10,795 --> 00:38:12,175
ah but also like yeah and the

1128
00:38:12,175 --> 00:38:13,735
background can move a lot so it

1129
00:38:13,735 --> 00:38:15,295
makes them look like they're dancing much

1130
00:38:15,295 --> 00:38:18,145
more intensely really are it's like they're

1131
00:38:18,145 --> 00:38:19,285
kind of like dude you to do

1132
00:38:19,285 --> 00:38:21,055
but it's like you kind of it's

1133
00:38:21,055 --> 00:38:22,675
something that's happening every tick tock i've

basic dance side decide and then laughing

1137
00:38:28,765 --> 00:38:30,205

threesome of all podcasts you believe is

1175
00:40:04,105 --> 00:40:08,275
a clarification um you remember we played

1176
00:40:08,275 --> 00:40:09,265
three via where we

1177
00:40:09,325 --> 00:40:11,395
have trivia about each other and we

1178
00:40:11,395 --> 00:40:13,285
talked about stevia it's a great game

1179
00:40:13,345 --> 00:40:15,085
we didn't we never got to stevia

1180
00:40:15,595 --> 00:40:17,065
you know i feel bad i know

1181
00:40:17,065 --> 00:40:18,715
so many questions things are to feel

1182
00:40:18,715 --> 00:40:22,255
bad i love talking about it oh

1183
00:40:22,255 --> 00:40:24,445
i felt the hip hello andy

1184
00:40:24,445 --> 00:40:27,925
e on the ah like the table

1185
00:40:28,045 --> 00:40:29,935
oh my god it's like a pointy

1186
00:40:29,965 --> 00:40:32,305
move because it's the class between the

1187
00:40:32,305 --> 00:40:35,005
two okay i'll try to do something

1188
00:40:35,035 --> 00:40:36,445
just do there's nothing i can do

1189
00:40:36,535 --> 00:40:38,035
alright and maybe there is but it

1190
00:40:38,035 --> 00:40:38,995
doesn't matter i could just be more

1191
00:40:38,995 --> 00:40:41,545
careful there's something you could do see

1192
00:40:41,545 --> 00:40:44,515
me in court um so

1193
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,478
we first did the freedom trivia of

1194
00:40:47,505 --> 00:40:50,050
submitted by nathan diffie yeah great nathan

1195
00:40:50,050 --> 00:40:53,170
duffy and then we did it again

1196
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,240
but questions were sending by a different

1197
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:58,360
person somebody that lee yeah and just

1198
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:00,790
wanted to clarify because there might have

1199
00:41:00,790 --> 00:41:04,930
been some overlapping questions yeah that um

1200
00:41:05,410 --> 00:41:07,690
nobody was swiping anybody else's questions they

1201
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:09,700
are the symptom independently of each other

1202
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:11,530
right and oh is that a question

1203
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:14,950
wait i don't know what we're talking

1204
00:41:14,950 --> 00:41:16,420
about right well so we do are

1205
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:18,610
you gonna explain this is just no

1206
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:21,040
i am doing are you gonna explain

1207
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:23,440
yourself call because we're sitting here waiting

1208
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:26,830
for this to make sense so just

1209
00:41:26,830 --> 00:41:29,590
so both nathan and lee know

1210
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:32,770
no one's they they came up with

1211
00:41:32,770 --> 00:41:34,840
their questions independently it just happened that

1212
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:36,610
some of them coincide some of them

1213
00:41:36,610 --> 00:41:37,630
were they came up with the same

1214
00:41:37,630 --> 00:41:40,180
but it was parallel thought yes parallel

1215
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:41,470
thought yes which happens a lot on

1216
00:41:41,470 --> 00:41:44,470
comedy okay it does and i just

1217
00:41:44,470 --> 00:41:45,820
got asked about a joke i made

1218
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:48,340
earlier ah this morning someone texts me

1219
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:49,420
and said what was your joke about

1220
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:50,770
such and such because they're writing

1221
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,840
for a show and i don't want

1222
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:54,610
us i don't want thames that happens

1223
00:41:54,610 --> 00:41:55,900
you know you know even and i

1224
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:57,310
said ask me if i give a

1225
00:41:57,310 --> 00:41:59,560

1228
00:42:02,890 --> 00:42:05,020
dollars sorry so lee i think lee

1229
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:07,330
it doesn't matter but anyway so that's

1230
00:42:07,330 --> 00:42:08,830
that's the point oh no i'm well

1231
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:10,330
if there were duplicate questions oh no

1232
00:42:10,330 --> 00:42:10,930
we may have whos

1233
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:13,090
declaring early shining to to yeah because

1234
00:42:13,090 --> 00:42:14,830
i didn't realize that word we were

1235
00:42:14,830 --> 00:42:16,660
trying we're trying to to hear the

1236
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:18,670
clearly or for both of them because

1237
00:42:18,732 --> 00:42:20,442
are both heated and they're both oh

1238
00:42:20,442 --> 00:42:21,970
my very upset both furious i was

1239
00:42:21,970 --> 00:42:24,130
gonna say i'm i'm in the middle

1240
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:25,360
i thought maybe you were going to

1241
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:27,280
mention that we got one wrong i

1242
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:29,080
answered my own question yeah yeah now

1243
00:42:29,104 --> 00:42:31,060
the corrections yeah that's we guys

1244
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:33,010
this is really embarrassed there was a

1245
00:42:33,010 --> 00:42:34,810
question and should we look this up

1246
00:42:34,810 --> 00:42:37,210
to make sure part of no part

1247
00:42:37,210 --> 00:42:39,040
of what is the best kind of

1248
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:40,720
correct part of what i love is

1249
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:42,610
that the questions don't come with answers

1250
00:42:42,610 --> 00:42:44,020
because they're about us and we should

1251
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:45,820
know and i still didn't know when

1252
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:47,170
i got my own question wrong but

1253
00:42:47,170 --> 00:42:49,150
here's part of why it was hard

1254
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:51,190
for me it was a fact-based question

1255
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:53,110
this was not my numbers on your

1256
00:42:53,110 --> 00:42:55,952
photos or my feeling as my memories

1257
00:42:55,997 --> 00:42:57,100
my feelings which is what i remember

1258
00:42:57,100 --> 00:42:58,840
the most is based on a fact

1259
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:00,520
which i care about the least so

1260
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:02,590
it's not based on your memories which

1261
00:43:02,590 --> 00:43:04,870
are not facts my memories or whatever

1262
00:43:04,870 --> 00:43:06,250
i remember hey our memories are not

1263
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:08,080
looking i might say shit that's not

1264
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:09,130
true but i would still know the

1265
00:43:09,130 --> 00:43:10,660
answer to the question because it's whatever

1266
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:11,410
i've created them

1267
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:13,360
my mind is running the past right

1268
00:43:13,510 --> 00:43:15,370
now apparently my first episode of coin

1269
00:43:15,392 --> 00:43:17,530
gaming i said it was with adam

1270
00:43:17,530 --> 00:43:20,530
brody it was in fact with gillian

1271
00:43:20,530 --> 00:43:23,470
jacobs and paul f tompkins me and

1272
00:43:23,470 --> 00:43:26,380
that does sound familiar but um i

1273
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:27,730
think adam maybe it was my second

1274
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:29,860
or third but anyways it was so

1275
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:31,030
long ago it was a million years

1276
00:43:31,030 --> 00:43:31,570
ago if you

1277
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:32,470
want to know if that's true or

1278
00:43:32,470 --> 00:43:33,850
not you can look it up i

1279
00:43:33,850 --> 00:43:34,840
just wanted to say that i might

1280
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:37,240
have been wrong as david takes retro

1281
00:43:37,270 --> 00:43:39,490
greg takes it takes a village but

1282
00:43:39,490 --> 00:43:40,630
it takes a big person to admit

1283
00:43:40,630 --> 00:43:41,860
they might have been wrong it takes

1284
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:43,510

grandmother foodstuffs that's what it was when

1362
00:46:17,950 --> 00:46:19,870
i was a kid that's what she

1363
00:46:19,870 --> 00:46:22,203
said so the game i don't know

1364
00:46:22,216 --> 00:46:22,930
it's cause

1365
00:46:22,930 --> 00:46:26,230
called but it's where we each text

1366
00:46:26,230 --> 00:46:27,760
each other one word and then we

1367
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:29,710
have we do a scene and we

1368
00:46:29,710 --> 00:46:31,330
have to throw that word in there

1369
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:32,350
and then we have to guess what

1370
00:46:32,350 --> 00:46:35,950
the word is great great great fine

1371
00:46:36,490 --> 00:46:37,570

1372
00:46:37,690 --> 00:46:39,400

00:46:45,460 --> 00:46:46,840
yeah i think guys got one right

1377
00:46:46,870 --> 00:46:47,890
i think i find it really hard

1378
00:46:47,890 --> 00:46:50,080
because you're concentrating on your own word

1379
00:46:50,110 --> 00:46:53,042
yeah unseen yes yeah let's try i

1380
00:46:53,110 --> 00:46:54,610
think the sound is the hardest let's

1381
00:46:54,610 --> 00:46:55,840
try it this time we're all gonna

1382
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:57,520
get it yeah okay so we're gonna

1383
00:46:57,580 --> 00:46:59,410
text this way you can say that

1384
00:46:59,410 --> 00:47:00,640
about most games but maybe not this

1385
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:00,760
one

1386
00:47:03,100 --> 00:47:04,060
no i just think you were so

1387
00:47:04,060 --> 00:47:06,250
immersed in your scene usually well you're

1388
00:47:06,251 --> 00:47:07,540
true you know you're doing i do

1389
00:47:07,540 --> 00:47:08,890
the work i think it should be

00:47:08,980 --> 00:47:10,510
a phrase because i think that that

1391
00:47:10,510 --> 00:47:12,130
makes it a little bit oh not

1392
00:47:12,130 --> 00:47:14,230
gonna work and then will graduate to

1393
00:47:14,230 --> 00:47:15,310

00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:16,120
weren't going to be putting fifteen minutes

1419
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:17,620
is long enough i think it is

1420
00:48:17,620 --> 00:48:19,030
i just think we just need to

1421
00:48:19,030 --> 00:48:19,960
kind of because we have a lot

1422
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:21,250

1423
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:22,540
to get through i mean we do

1424
00:48:22,540 --> 00:48:24,130
but i wanted to close the door

1425
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:25,300

1429
00:48:30,820 --> 00:48:32,110
