255
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,200
like i'm sure like if there's a

256
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,550
hot seat in there like wow we

257
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:02,910
can't do

258
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,920
i think just weddings and shit you

259
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:05,850
gotta put her in flats the whole

260
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:07,380
time you got a pair of flats

261
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,030
and she's still like a giant test

262
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:11,790
but um there's something about it that

263
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:14,550
makes her very bird-like in the wig

264
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:16,410
and everything she's kind of like yeah

265
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:17,850
i think she's trying to makers of

266
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:19,980
a little bit smaller sometimes oh like

267
00:09:19,988 --> 00:09:21,000
hey i know i'm not supposed to

268
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,800
be so yeah

269
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:25,590
why did i fuckin bring that up

270
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:28,050
ah the crown so there's scenes where

271
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,270
their scenes where oh i had a

272
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:31,320
point this one

273
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:36,150
ah aka three to something that never

274
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:38,040
happens on the show it happens so

275
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,750
rarely that it is cause for celebration

276
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:45,960
um say wow great job boy huh

277
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:49,800
celebrate she you know she tells she

278
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:53,550
sort of covertly does an autobiography with

279
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:56,610
ah what's his name andrew morton um

280
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,358
from morton's steakhouse yeah exactly cool he's

281
00:09:59,502 --> 00:10:01,020

steak menu you write about me

283
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,650
yeah it's crazy she had the foresight

284
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:09,320
to do this nobody sees this coming

285
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:12,650
so but then she does an interview

286
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:14,300
later with the bbc and they and

287
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,640
i as i was thinking it that

288
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,470
i have i think queen elizabeth say

289
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:20,810

00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,141
harry and meghan markle it's like finally

295
00:10:30,141 --> 00:10:30,680

296
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,360

00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:39,350
one knows the full story only we

301
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:40,700
know the full story and i guess

302
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:41,510
now we're all going to know

303
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:44,960
and then we know it um i

304
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,220
know we could guess it yeah i

305
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:48,830
mean i'm they suck okay i'm interested

306
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:50,660
i say to them that the royal

307
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:51,710
family yeah

308
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:56,180
i mean it was this incredibly archaic

309
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:58,940
outdated institution made up of inbred people

310
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:01,550
suck i don't understand and no and

311
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:04,190
morsi i apologize to people who who

312
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:05,600
love it for reasons that i can't

313
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,950
comprehend but what what is there to

314
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:08,930
like about is it's just ceremonial right

315
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,850
right you know i put there enjoyed

316
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:12,440
the words family tradition as

317
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:15,440
a common tradition of tradition and joy

318
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:16,880
i guess but i've i've taken a

319
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,340
tourist tradition and every time that i

320
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:20,990
should have been so lucky to travel

321
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:23,360
like i enjoy your show going by

322
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,400
and seeing the things in traditional jewels

323
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,020
and and all that tapes i find

324
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,480
it very interesting to some extent but

325
00:11:29,824 --> 00:11:32,030
i i also think it's actually more

326
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:32,600
interesting in some

327
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:34,400
ways now with it being so modern

328
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,720
and there being an l people making

329
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,670
away from it it's like it's changing

330
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:38,570
like i think when you go when

331
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:40,100
you look at the museum stuff and

332
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,330
you see all the old jewels it's

333
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:42,830
like it feels so long ago it's

334
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:43,850
actually not i think that's part of

335
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:45,740
what's interesting with the crown yeah is

336
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:47,870
that you go wait that was like

337
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:49,190
the fifties yeah you know it's like

338
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:51,260
it's not long ago like that's kind

339
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:52,430
of weird it's times like this

340
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:55,340
that we're talking about are like yeah

341
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56,600
yeah it's like i sort of put

342
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,060
them in a category like they're not

343
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:00,380
the same age as people i really

344
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:02,090
know don't think there exists in this

345
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:04,490
other world yeah that's that's my grandma's

346
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:06,200
you hundred years earlier than the time

347
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,490
the threshold right yeah but it's like

348
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:09,863
no slayer happening they're still doing a

349
00:12:09,863 --> 00:12:11,990
could go to target they just don't

350
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,900
i'm gonna be so cool to see

351
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:20,180
charles the great leveller but will you

352
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:21,830
go to target for sure like every

353
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:23,845
choice excuse me king chart that's true

354
00:12:23,981 --> 00:12:25,913
he's the king now we thought we

355
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:27,590
thought it would never happen do you

356
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:30,200
know i referred to princess diana's lady

357
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,240
die almost all the time when i

358
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:33,440
when i think of her i forget

359
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,820
that she's pretty because it was lady

360
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,200
di for such a long time and

361
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,940
when i was growing up and then

362
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:39,290
i heard a winch person on a

363
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:40,580
tv show refer to her as lady

364
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:42,080
and i felt like oh i'm not

365
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,300
the only one what's the difference um

366
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,007
well before she was four she was

367
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,260
princess she was lady die so she

368
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:51,320
became princess when whenever she married o

369
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,550
just married charles

370
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:55,610

like she seems too cool you know

720
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,800
it's like we had a whole new

721
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:08,350
generation coming in of interesting p because

722
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:09,460
you want someone who's bit of a

723
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:11,410
hot mess and why i think we'll

724
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:12,640
find out that some of them are

725
00:25:12,670 --> 00:25:14,920
oh boy i can't wait let's do

726
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:17,530
anything being funded yeah we don't and

727
00:25:17,530 --> 00:25:18,610
you don't have to call it real

728
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:18,850
house

729
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,260
ivs you can switch pans by the

730
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:21,455
way if that one's running hey include

731
00:25:21,455 --> 00:25:22,780
you that you don't have to call

00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:24,100
a real housewives but just call it

733
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:27,760

00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,740
the cameras follow us the three friend

735
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:31,600
wives i don't think we would make

00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,240
a good reality show i think when

737
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,170
doj navy horrible

738
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,750
i think we would be forced to

739
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:39,040

841
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:24,580
if you want it's fun to make

842
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:25,990

843
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:28,840
piles how how many times you wipe

844
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,640
holly said i'm interested how many times

845
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,200
a day well you know as they

846
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,790
get older you don't change their diaper

847
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:35,650
as frequently so you're in a stage

848
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:37,000
right now where you're doing it every

849
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,190
couple hours at least probably right for

850
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:40,317
yeah once again i want to say

851
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,740
a sniffed into the microphone and we

852
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:44,170
will cut that up okay um i

853
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:48,160
probably change like four neighbors a day

854
00:29:48,670 --> 00:29:49,960
for all of them hollies

855
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:52,420

856
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:53,620
other day person changes

857
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:57,438
um so that's three so it's like

858
00:29:57,460 --> 00:30:00,040
that's every yeah every six six you

859
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,540
know but it doesn't make sense because

860
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:02,920
it's not during the night so like

861
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:04,990
okay let's see one in the morning

862
00:30:05,050 --> 00:30:07,180
then i do one before naptime then

863
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:09,100
i do want after nap time then

864
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:12,130
i do one before we you know

00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,660
change it before the beth and i

866
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:14,740
do and maybe

867
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,030
and maybe there's one in the middle

868
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,940
and then i do one before bed

869
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,530
or put it on but then let

870
00:30:20,530 --> 00:30:21,730
him call and contexts i'm just putting

871
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:23,470

878
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:34,150
a fourteen month old that's true okay

879
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:34,930
so what do i need

880
00:30:35,655 --> 00:30:40,335
it's just ah fourteen months ah you

881
00:30:40,335 --> 00:30:41,115
don't need to know any of it

882
00:30:41,115 --> 00:30:42,975
now you just need to know what's

883
00:30:42,975 --> 00:30:44,985
happening right now really i honestly think

884
00:30:44,985 --> 00:30:46,545
that's true like you just i feel

885
00:30:46,545 --> 00:30:47,985
like for me it was more it's

886
00:30:47,985 --> 00:30:49,695
so overwhelming to like think too far

887
00:30:49,695 --> 00:30:51,645
ahead it's like okay what's the next

888
00:30:51,645 --> 00:30:52,875
thing she's gonna do like show you

889
00:30:52,875 --> 00:30:53,835
know in a couple months she'll start

890
00:30:53,835 --> 00:30:55,125
rolling over and stuff and then you

891
00:30:55,125 --> 00:30:55,725
have to change up

892
00:30:55,785 --> 00:30:57,617
now she sleeps because that'll change that

893
00:30:57,617 --> 00:30:59,205
it's like don't worry about that yet

894
00:30:59,205 --> 00:31:00,225
because you don't do it yet you

895
00:31:00,225 --> 00:31:01,755
know it's just shiny things like who

896
00:31:01,755 --> 00:31:03,045
gives a shit at this point well

897
00:31:03,045 --> 00:31:04,665
it's just like you are at this

898
00:31:04,665 --> 00:31:05,835
point i feel like i'm doing really

899
00:31:05,835 --> 00:31:07,215
well because it's like right and you'll

900
00:31:07,215 --> 00:31:09,225
continue to because you'll just change slowly

901
00:31:09,225 --> 00:31:11,415
each new thing that happens and you

902
00:31:11,415 --> 00:31:12,855
don't have to get overwhelmed by all

903
00:31:12,855 --> 00:31:13,725
of the things that are going to

904
00:31:13,725 --> 00:31:15,345
happen we sent you a picture of

905
00:31:15,975 --> 00:31:18,855
my daughter the other day you correctly

906
00:31:18,855 --> 00:31:21,975
identified she was wearing holly ali's old

907
00:31:21,975 --> 00:31:25,605
pants oh hi anyway i realised i

908
00:31:25,605 --> 00:31:27,255
never have to buy clothes ever again

909
00:31:27,255 --> 00:31:29,447
because you'll just constantly give me this

910
00:31:29,447 --> 00:31:30,855
gets old quick because i and i

911
00:31:30,855 --> 00:31:31,995
will get you a lot i was

912
00:31:31,995 --> 00:31:33,615
actually going for then either it made

913
00:31:33,615 --> 00:31:34,785
me kind of feel like i should

914
00:31:34,785 --> 00:31:35,895
buy some clothes

915
00:31:36,165 --> 00:31:37,785
for holly now would be great so

916
00:31:37,785 --> 00:31:39,225
that i can get eventually yeah that

917
00:31:39,255 --> 00:31:40,605
really nice um

918
00:31:42,075 --> 00:31:44,265
great scheme i was like i wonder

919
00:31:44,265 --> 00:31:45,885
how people feel about this and i

920
00:31:45,885 --> 00:31:47,235
think it depends on how much storage

921
00:31:47,235 --> 00:31:47,925
you have in your house but like

922
00:31:47,925 --> 00:31:50,295
i was holding onto so much stuff

923
00:31:50,295 --> 00:31:51,255
and then i started to feel really

924
00:31:51,255 --> 00:31:53,085
overwhelmed and i was like wait because

925
00:31:53,085 --> 00:31:55,335
even if i have another child i

926
00:31:55,365 --> 00:31:57,435
can't keep everything she outgrew because then

927
00:31:57,465 --> 00:31:59,533
she continues to grow for years it's

928
00:31:59,533 --> 00:32:01,425
like exactly goes on forever so i

929
00:32:01,425 --> 00:32:01,755
started

930
00:32:01,785 --> 00:32:04,095
just getting rid of things which felt

931
00:32:04,095 --> 00:32:05,235
really good but at the time when

932
00:32:05,235 --> 00:32:06,225
i'm packing them away i was like

933
00:32:06,255 --> 00:32:07,332
oh these are so sentimental and then

934
00:32:07,349 --> 00:32:08,475
i opened it i was like oh

935
00:32:08,475 --> 00:32:09,375
i don't really care about this but

936
00:32:09,375 --> 00:32:10,185

00:35:43,935 --> 00:35:45,975
this type of person you know so

1047
00:35:46,755 --> 00:35:47,625
if you're not fun

1048
00:35:47,625 --> 00:35:49,815
funny and you're making that it's actually

1049
00:35:49,845 --> 00:35:51,795
it's so misogynistic i can't take it

1050
00:35:51,795 --> 00:35:53,865
awesome absolutely horrible but you did it

1051
00:35:53,865 --> 00:35:56,805

don't think it's actually good but i

1056
00:36:03,105 --> 00:36:04,995

00:36:04,995 --> 00:36:06,765
layers that i can then yeah i

1058
00:36:06,945 --> 00:36:07,785
understand yeah

1059
00:36:07,785 --> 00:36:10,455
yeah but i think what we what

1060
00:36:10,455 --> 00:36:12,645
we need to do is we need

1061
00:36:12,645 --> 00:36:16,785
to do a picture around christmas time

1063
00:36:19,275 --> 00:36:20,505
