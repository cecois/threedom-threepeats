253
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:39,810
um well one time when i was

254
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:42,450
in fifth grade my friend was my

255
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:43,620
friend's house and there was this giant

256
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:44,760
pile of woodchips in front of her

257
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:48,720
house like probably sounds five feet tall

258
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:52,290
and was this down in the holler

259
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,990
it was just huge oh look at

260
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:57,330
all those nice wood chips you got

261
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:58,800
must have and take a lot

262
00:09:58,802 --> 00:10:00,120
long time to build up a collection

263
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,100
like that yeah one by one over

264
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:05,250
the years but we you think she

265
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:06,810
would have gotten them like three or

266
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:08,580
four times you know or three years

267
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:08,970
another

268
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:13,280
anyway as we were running up and

269
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,900
down and it was really fun like

270
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:16,400
just running as fast you can do

271
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,960
it sounds running down the hill yeah

272
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,700
it was a blast and then we

273
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,230
each notice that we're getting a little

274
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:23,090
like um like kind of like it

275
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:24,890
felt like a little splinter or something

276
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:27,020
was hitting our legs in our like

277
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:29,120
of easting in the moment we thought

278
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,950
it was little splinters from the woodchips

279
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:33,740
and then we realized we were running

280
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:36,970
on a yellow jacket hive and we

281
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:39,530
they were all in our clothes and

282
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:42,440
buying wow and so we like ran

283
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,970
in the house and really taking our

284
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:44,480
clothes off like

285
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,850

286
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:48,680

287
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:49,850

00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:06,290
over no no you probably erased him

373
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:08,210
out of like i think i think

374
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:10,370
she she in the first cut or

375
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:12,080
the original cut she was like remembering

376
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:14,337
him you saw clips of members oh

377
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:15,710
oh and then they remembered there are

378
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:16,460
old clips

379
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:19,400
yeah we don't have to

380
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:23,840
because there's extensive footage of him as

381
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:26,630
this character why why was he called

382
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:27,290
mr big

383
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:29,600
because he's like a big shot he

384
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,590
has like a lot of money and

385
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:31,940
he was like run around the back

386
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:34,520
of a town man yeah yeah so

387
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,890
it wasn't a penis thing no his

388
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:39,830
penis was never discussed as never she

389
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:40,790
said didn't she say he had a

390
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:42,170
micro penis but she still loved him

391
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:48,770
she said that nirvana is in the

392
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,640
first movie right

393
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:52,370
she turned out to the audience and

394
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:56,030
said ah he's just like any other

395
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:59,000
because he'll wonder what i need a

396
00:14:59,000 --> 00:14:59,570
microscope

397
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:04,970
that's a small one that's right you

398
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:08,360
hear about micro-businesses or microbiota and you're

399
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,650
like ok i can still see with

400
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:12,620
the naked eye no pun intended guys

401
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:14,450
got well my eyes are always naked

402
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,360
from fucking my eyes always naked because

403
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,850
my eyelids don't work wow and that

404
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:20,780
seems really painful

405
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,550
it sucks and i can't i slept

406
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:25,400
in ten years i like the sweaters

407
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,380
of the eyes can you really sleep

408
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:28,670
without eyelids couldn't you just put something

409
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:29,390
over your eyes

410
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:31,880
but it's right on your eyeball

411
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:35,360
like a scrappy blanket

412
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:38,510
with like the cups well ah but

413
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:39,830
then you're just looking at the inside

414
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:39,980
of them

415
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:42,950
yeah but i still think you'd fall

416
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:45,320
asleep eventually i mean eventually your eyes

417
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:46,804
roll back and put a book

418
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:49,730
you could put a book in where

419
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,548
in the mass cleanup in the wayland

420
00:15:52,548 --> 00:15:54,650
so when you close your eyes yeah

421
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:57,410
yeah do your eyes roll back or

422
00:15:57,410 --> 00:15:58,430
is that something that like a little

423
00:15:58,430 --> 00:15:58,850
kids thing

424
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:01,370

425
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:04,700

426
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,650
now no they just kind of like

427
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,210
the art from side to side very

428
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:10,490
rapidly yeah instantly whenever it closed my

429
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,140

449
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:12,620

00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:13,880
a fortune now what are some of

451
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,230
your greatest hits

they change so frequently it's like nothing

453
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:19,980
sticks around long enough for me to

454
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:20,480

499
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:07,190

did you think it was yeah you

502
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,050
ideally i was like is this going

503
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:13,250
to be a documentary about when i

504
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:14,300
ran over that high

505
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:17,360
um it's really good though i i

506
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,070
waited a long time within the best

507
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:20,090
part about waiting is that you can

508
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:20,780
binge it all

509
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:23,150
true theory that's very true

510
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:25,820
every the whole cast is so good

511
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:26,990
what is going on with your cuckoo

512
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:29,090
camera i just say maybe don't acknowledge

513
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:30,440
it because no one else no sin

514
00:19:30,447 --> 00:19:32,720
is happening except you but you're laying

515
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,880
out and you know you're not talking

516
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,710
the way you normally do like steamrolling

517
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:38,930
us and yeah it's like i'm able

518
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:39,740
to get my thoughts out and i

519
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:41,270
feel stressed um

520
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:42,920
i don't like my mom that i'm

521
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,510
able to say crazy how does not

522
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:46,850
doing his job i have heard you

523
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,940
on ah your podcast with janey tell

524
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:51,200
her not to call things out like

525
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,000
that and i think he's got a

526
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,980
point but i still understand why she

527
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:56,233
did it but i wouldn't talk to

528
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,350
him because you do you have the

529
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:58,730
same thought process so and you're both

530
00:19:58,730 --> 00:19:58,910
wrong

531
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:00,200

532
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,090

new people that i wasn't familiar with

536
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:12,320
there was a lot of great acting

537
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,930
in that show the the the young

538
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:16,700
lady who plays young jackie

539
00:20:17,875 --> 00:20:21,535
and um we call her we aren't

540
00:20:21,835 --> 00:20:22,794
the first time we ever saw her

541
00:20:22,794 --> 00:20:24,115
was in a show called sweet bitter

542
00:20:24,775 --> 00:20:26,845
and so okay when we see her

543
00:20:26,845 --> 00:20:28,825
when we refer to her on this

544
00:20:28,825 --> 00:20:30,445
show we just call her sweet bitter

545
00:20:32,065 --> 00:20:33,505
she reminds me so much of somebody

546
00:20:33,505 --> 00:20:35,155
i can't figure it out do you

547
00:20:35,155 --> 00:20:36,595
know what actors reminds you of

548
00:20:38,035 --> 00:20:39,745

00:20:39,745 --> 00:20:40,465
voice

550
00:20:42,685 --> 00:20:45,115
never i don't um but what should

551
00:20:45,274 --> 00:20:48,055
the audience surrogate for anyone who hasn't

552
00:20:48,055 --> 00:20:50,815

avoided all these movies to some extent

609
00:22:46,405 --> 00:22:47,484

was mad and was pacing around the

624
00:23:20,425 --> 00:23:23,245
room wow that i'd gotten myself into

625
00:23:23,245 --> 00:23:25,195

626
00:23:25,195 --> 00:23:26,605
watching lord of the rings and star

627
00:23:26,605 --> 00:23:27,205

631
00:23:31,705 --> 00:23:33,085

681
00:25:03,955 --> 00:25:06,805
there's a video going around of a

682
00:25:06,805 --> 00:25:10,286
guy in on like a freeway or

683
00:25:10,286 --> 00:25:13,195
a highway and he there's a car

684
00:25:13,195 --> 00:25:14,935
kind of like trying to get around

685
00:25:14,935 --> 00:25:17,275
other cars and he's taping it and

686
00:25:17,665 --> 00:25:18,475
he's like

687
00:25:19,645 --> 00:25:21,235
kind of goes around and tries to

688
00:25:21,235 --> 00:25:22,719
get in between them and cans and

689
00:25:22,719 --> 00:25:23,635
then he goes on the side of

690
00:25:23,635 --> 00:25:25,555
the road on the shoulder and goes

691
00:25:25,555 --> 00:25:27,805
around them and then spins out and

692
00:25:27,865 --> 00:25:30,475
um crashes shit like flips the car

693
00:25:30,475 --> 00:25:33,595
over and meanwhile the people narrating it

694
00:25:33,595 --> 00:25:37,193
are like haha oh um serves you

695
00:25:37,193 --> 00:25:39,685
right but now look

696
00:25:39,775 --> 00:25:42,715
i understand that impulse sure you know

697
00:25:42,715 --> 00:25:45,175
what i mean yeah totally i mean

698
00:25:45,175 --> 00:25:47,245
like i used to talk about how

699
00:25:47,545 --> 00:25:48,835
there should be an app where you

700
00:25:48,835 --> 00:25:50,305
put in someone who cuts you off

701
00:25:50,305 --> 00:25:52,675
in traffic their license plate number and

702
00:25:52,675 --> 00:25:54,295
it gives you like a ping alert

703
00:25:54,355 --> 00:25:56,005
when they get into a car crash

704
00:25:56,005 --> 00:25:57,295
and die so you can laugh

705
00:25:59,845 --> 00:26:01,345
yeah the kid shared that with us

706
00:26:01,345 --> 00:26:02,515
before that idea

707
00:26:04,405 --> 00:26:06,295
so i understand the impulse so i

708
00:26:06,295 --> 00:26:07,615
just wonder where you do it on

709
00:26:07,615 --> 00:26:08,995
you anyway

710
00:26:09,055 --> 00:26:11,215
thank you i think you understand a

711
00:26:11,215 --> 00:26:12,985
lot of impulses we might not understand

712
00:26:13,105 --> 00:26:14,335
was it are you talking about this

713
00:26:14,335 --> 00:26:15,355

00:27:30,175 --> 00:27:31,705
let some people out of the parking

743
00:27:31,705 --> 00:27:32,035
lot in

744
00:27:32,065 --> 00:27:33,205
turn in front of me like a

745
00:27:33,265 --> 00:27:34,975
good boy or good boy wow that

746
00:27:34,975 --> 00:27:37,315
was really caring i was driving very

747
00:27:37,375 --> 00:27:38,575
carefully and slowly

748
00:27:39,955 --> 00:27:41,995
should not on my phone or anything

749
00:27:41,995 --> 00:27:44,485
like that so you were perfect ah

750
00:27:44,695 --> 00:27:46,645
i made a left into a parking

751
00:27:46,645 --> 00:27:49,075
spot where there it was the there

752
00:27:49,075 --> 00:27:50,485
was a car parked in the one

753
00:27:50,485 --> 00:27:51,745
on the left to car parked on

754
00:27:51,805 --> 00:27:52,825
in the one on the right this

755
00:27:52,825 --> 00:27:56,155
is typical canby how it appears in

756
00:27:56,155 --> 00:27:58,405
parking lots and you've been trained from

757
00:27:58,405 --> 00:28:00,115
your driving training

758
00:28:00,235 --> 00:28:01,675
to know how to park him between

759
00:28:01,675 --> 00:28:03,685
these two certainly you gotta use all

760
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:05,875
training that's right i used i used

761
00:28:05,875 --> 00:28:08,480
all of it i use to in

762
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,825
the way you learned deep down yeah

763
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:12,325
because every time i do anything in

764
00:28:12,325 --> 00:28:13,465
a car i act like it's the

765
00:28:13,465 --> 00:28:15,085
first time i'm doing it and and

766
00:28:15,085 --> 00:28:18,445
smart that is the smaller scared thinking

767
00:28:18,685 --> 00:28:19,165
hey

768
00:28:20,935 --> 00:28:22,885
so i made the left into the

769
00:28:22,885 --> 00:28:24,595
parking spot and when and i'm going

770
00:28:24,595 --> 00:28:26,035
like you know two or three miles

771
00:28:26,035 --> 00:28:28,315
an hour or whatever when i'm slow

772
00:28:28,525 --> 00:28:30,715
and when i'm eighty percent in the

773
00:28:30,715 --> 00:28:33,985
car on the passenger side without looking

774
00:28:34,645 --> 00:28:37,105
swings her door open don't she just

775
00:28:37,105 --> 00:28:38,724
sitting i think she'd been sitting in

776
00:28:38,724 --> 00:28:39,655
there for a while because their brake

777
00:28:39,655 --> 00:28:40,435
lights weren't on like

778
00:28:40,435 --> 00:28:41,905
if she hadn't just got there i

779
00:28:41,935 --> 00:28:43,345
think she was like reading her phone

780
00:28:43,345 --> 00:28:44,665
or whatever and then just like swung

781
00:28:44,665 --> 00:28:47,455
the door open and i crashed right

782
00:28:47,455 --> 00:28:50,185
into the the edge of the dough

783
00:28:50,665 --> 00:28:53,425
oh that's really weird accident and and

784
00:28:53,425 --> 00:28:56,185
it it made a major like indentation

785
00:28:56,185 --> 00:29:00,535
in my passenger side major operation of

786
00:29:00,535 --> 00:29:00,595
my

787
00:29:00,595 --> 00:29:03,715
my best friend's ride and ah huh

788
00:29:03,835 --> 00:29:06,295
and so so it was shocking to

789
00:29:06,295 --> 00:29:07,615
like all of us because cool op

790
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:09,145
was in the passenger side she was

791
00:29:09,145 --> 00:29:13,105
like oh yeah i could barely understand

792
00:29:13,105 --> 00:29:14,455
what was happening and then the driver

793
00:29:14,455 --> 00:29:18,805
was like rattled and shocked um and

794
00:29:18,805 --> 00:29:20,755
so here's my issue so

795
00:29:20,755 --> 00:29:23,875
so i isn't okay for your wife

796
00:29:23,875 --> 00:29:24,475
to yell

797
00:29:26,605 --> 00:29:28,555
i back up i let her close

798
00:29:28,555 --> 00:29:29,605
her door and then i go back

799
00:29:29,605 --> 00:29:30,415
into the space

800
00:29:31,735 --> 00:29:35,635
um my issue is that because i

801
00:29:35,635 --> 00:29:37,375
have an old car you know that

802
00:29:37,375 --> 00:29:38,905
has that's you know has some dings

803
00:29:38,905 --> 00:29:40,435
already oh my god i can't wait

804
00:29:40,435 --> 00:29:41,185
to look into the issue

805
00:29:43,015 --> 00:29:44,635
i basically if she had said oh

806
00:29:44,635 --> 00:29:46,195
my god i'm so sorry

807
00:29:47,425 --> 00:29:48,625
i did that without looking i would

808
00:29:48,655 --> 00:29:50,485
said you know on lance don't even

809
00:29:50,485 --> 00:29:51,985
worry about it yeah let's just go

810
00:29:51,985 --> 00:29:55,225
about our day but instead she was

811
00:29:55,435 --> 00:29:57,355
either she thinks she's not at fault

812
00:29:57,415 --> 00:30:00,055
or a whore she's been trained not

813
00:30:00,055 --> 00:30:02,455
to admit admit fault

814
00:30:03,775 --> 00:30:05,695
so she just like does not say

815
00:30:05,695 --> 00:30:07,465
anything about how careless it was or

816
00:30:07,465 --> 00:30:10,225
anything like that and to the point

817
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:11,575
where i start going like am i

818
00:30:11,605 --> 00:30:13,675
crazy like was that my fault or

819
00:30:13,675 --> 00:30:17,005
something and colombo's into to you know

820
00:30:17,185 --> 00:30:18,805
make sure everything's okay and goes into

821
00:30:19,075 --> 00:30:21,085
start shopping while i'm dealing with this

822
00:30:21,295 --> 00:30:23,125
so i'm like psyching myself out almost

823
00:30:23,125 --> 00:30:23,635
going like

824
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:26,110
yeah man it's like is it my

825
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:28,090
fault or something or have my senses

826
00:30:28,090 --> 00:30:31,090
betrayed me um and so is this

827
00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:32,170
a dagger i see before me

828
00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:36,880
out out damn so um so we

829
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,320
exchanged the information and all that and

830
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,460
then we both have to shop in

831
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:41,350
the same place which is very awkward

832
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:44,410
yeah but so yeah so then i

833
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:45,460
asked up i was like

834
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,100
he's just circling the aisle at the

835
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:49,480
same time you you pass each other

836
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:52,300
and every literally was like creeping along

837
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,040
we were in the same aisle one

838
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:55,450
point and i i just was like

839
00:30:55,450 --> 00:30:56,620
forget it and i just went to

840
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:58,360
a different iowa used to crash your

841
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:02,590
heart into her as ringo ah now

842
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:03,640
what do we do oh who's at

843
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:05,500
fault so i asked cool up i

844
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:06,625
said it was my

845
00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:08,530
perception of that different than yours it

846
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:10,120
seemed to me like she just swung

847
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,920
the door open without looking and she's

848
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,870
like oh definitely she did not even

849
00:31:13,870 --> 00:31:17,590
notice you and you know so yeah

850
00:31:17,650 --> 00:31:19,300
and now it's all up to the

851
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:20,740
insurance like you know it's all up

852
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:22,240
to the insurance so annoying

853
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,370
so what you you gotta let go

854
00:31:24,370 --> 00:31:26,590
like this yeah god if you had

855
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:28,600
said oh don't worry about it like

856
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:30,340
was there any damage on her car

857
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,990
there were like just first of all

858
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:34,090
those mercedes benz okay so that's why

859
00:31:34,090 --> 00:31:36,190
she's worried that's why she's worried so

860
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:37,900
she had like she sent me pictures

861
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:39,760
of it there just like minor scratches

862
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:42,970
on it she definitely wants the money

863
00:31:42,970 --> 00:31:44,830
me too on sets we paid for

864
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:47,560
yeah i would say i would say

865
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:48,910
she wouldn't be the type of person

866
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:50,590
with that situation if her car was

867
00:31:50,590 --> 00:31:53,200
like really shiny and fancy that she's

868
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,900
not gonna go and whatever right do

869
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:56,860
you know what i was thinking about

870
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:58,840
today because i was in traffic and

871
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:01,150

00:32:01,150 --> 00:32:02,950
into my whatsapp candy

873
00:32:05,307 --> 00:32:07,390

on the highway no turn signal my

877
00:32:16,390 --> 00:32:19,360
fans ah haha way that's right and

878
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:22,780
my drift into your home is you

879
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:25,780
and i thought like why is it

880
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:27,610
that the people that are driving the

881
00:32:27,610 --> 00:32:31,690
most expensive cars never use turns out

882
00:32:31,690 --> 00:32:33,880
they're always rude huh yeah well it's

883
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:35,770
like wouldn't you if you had a

884
00:32:35,770 --> 00:32:38,230
fucking expensive car like that yeah wouldn't

885
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:39,940
you be like hey everybody look i'm

886
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:43,180

00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:43,450
so

888
00:32:43,450 --> 00:32:45,520
so when i had a mutual friend

889
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:46,720
talk about this because he's from the

890
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,700
east coast from new york city or

891
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:51,070

paul and he was saying i'm winning

894
00:32:57,250 --> 00:32:58,330
he had an interesting take on it

895
00:32:58,330 --> 00:33:00,820
because he was saying like when you're

896
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:02,860
in new york city no one uses

897
00:33:03,010 --> 00:33:03,610
turn signals

898
00:33:03,610 --> 00:33:06,220
pls because everyone is just trying to

899
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:08,110
eke into like you know there are

900
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:09,850
no they're basically there are no rules

901
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,110
yeah you know i mean like lanes

902
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:12,700
don't mean anything everyone's just kind of

903
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:15,250
trying to like fit through this very

904
00:33:15,250 --> 00:33:17,470
narrow it's a self-fulfilling prophecy that the

905
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:18,850
traffic is terrible because there are no

906
00:33:18,850 --> 00:33:22,450
rules yeah so he's like who cares

907
00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:23,680
about it out there but in

908
00:33:23,890 --> 00:33:26,140
in los angeles where we are it's

909
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:27,850
just very annoying when people treat it

910
00:33:27,850 --> 00:33:28,990
like it's new york city and just

911
00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:31,120
yeah roving all over the place and

912
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:33,520
usually stressful i mean you could always

913
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:35,500
tell when someone's about to do something

914
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:36,880
like that though it's like that weird

915
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:37,990
feeling like when you just see his

916
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:40,240
car said like yellow jacket says turns

917
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,460

me off or something or like they

920
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:47,020

crash right into me and then they

924
00:33:51,670 --> 00:33:53,770
do you know it's like it always

925
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,090

941
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:29,590
question for you oh yeah another car

942
00:34:29,590 --> 00:34:31,720
i had i also one other yes

943
00:34:31,810 --> 00:34:33,190
one other parts of the story which

944
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:34,510
was when i pulled out my insurance

945
00:34:34,510 --> 00:34:36,490
card you know like my turn

946
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:39,160
yeah when and then too i haven't

947
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:41,110
gotten into an accident in like ten

948
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:43,660
years only heard your voice i never

949
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:46,720
see you but but when i pulled

950
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:47,830
out my insurance card you know how

951
00:34:47,830 --> 00:34:49,300
they send you like to a year

952
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:50,800
and you have to constantly replace it

953
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:52,660
i had three in there that were

954
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:54,490
all old they send you to a

955
00:34:54,490 --> 00:34:56,620
year and you have to constantly replace

956
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:57,610
it yes

957
00:34:57,610 --> 00:34:59,290
it's because they they expire every six

958
00:34:59,290 --> 00:35:01,960
months but you also know constantly you

959
00:35:01,990 --> 00:35:03,700

feel secure knowing i have the app

962
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:09,670

00:41:04,783 --> 00:41:06,490
need doesn't really get hairy it's like

1123
00:41:06,490 --> 00:41:07,870
right under your knee and it would

1124
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:09,850
be like having a little beard gets

1125
00:41:09,850 --> 00:41:12,130
hairy is really not like ah the

1126
00:41:12,130 --> 00:41:13,720
same as the leg but there's hey

1127
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:16,300
my kneecaps are pretty bald let's check

1128
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:18,160
our kneecaps everyone and everyone listen

1129
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,750
being reach down and touch your kneecap

1130
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:22,690
to smash down touching a cup to

1131
00:41:22,783 --> 00:41:24,988
do do do do do you do

1132
00:41:24,994 --> 00:41:27,100
do you like right on the cap

1133
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:29,830
itself there's no hair but then right

1134
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:31,510
under it there's hay to me that

1135
00:41:31,510 --> 00:41:34,570
makes sense firing i have one really

1136
00:41:34,570 --> 00:41:36,400
long one in the center of my

1137
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:36,850
kneecap

1138
00:41:37,630 --> 00:41:39,160
so that's it it was weirdness that

1139
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:41,560
really leg hair only grows so long

1140
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:45,280
yeah it should grow yeah it should

1141
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:47,770
grow like acciona yes even your eyebrows

1142
00:41:47,770 --> 00:41:49,450
start to get nearer after a while

1143
00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:51,280
you know what i mean yeah my

1144
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,510
leg is grown up too i asked

1145
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:53,140
i shave

1146
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:57,100
ah so what what happens so so

1147
00:41:57,370 --> 00:41:58,509
okay so i've had you i would

1148
00:41:58,509 --> 00:41:59,710
you want your tree knock on your

1149
00:41:59,710 --> 00:42:01,510
neighbor's house and you stole their internet

00:42:02,950 --> 00:42:06,880
this on the peloton but my week

1152
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:09,040
was i was i was going to

1153
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:10,720
get on my my week was just

1154
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,520
about over when my internet went out

1155
00:42:12,989 --> 00:42:14,278
and i went out worrying about

1156
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,328
through the rest of the week it

1157
00:42:16,328 --> 00:42:17,350
went out through the rest of the

1158
00:42:17,350 --> 00:42:19,660
week oh that's a lie one time

1159
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:22,240
my streak wasn't was i was not

1160
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,830
gonna be able to keep my streak

1161
00:42:23,830 --> 00:42:25,780
going well i have a question i

1162
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:28,120
don't understand i never used boulton there's

1163
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:30,550
no like um not online setting where

1164
00:42:30,550 --> 00:42:32,500
you can just record your score or

1165
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:34,180
like your ride don't

1166
00:42:35,050 --> 00:42:36,220
i don't know there was a google

1167
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:39,190
sheet you can enter it manually no

1168
00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:40,251
but i mean like ah where you

1169
00:42:40,251 --> 00:42:41,710
would just press go and i know

1170
00:42:41,710 --> 00:42:43,450
that right around when you're on wi-fi

1171
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:44,860
i know i have a friend who

1172
00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:47,320
like doesn't take a class he just

1173
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,540
like goes through the countryside or whatever

1174
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:50,740
because they have that setting but i

1175
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:52,750
didn't have enough to do huh i

1176
00:42:52,750 --> 00:42:54,130
don't i think if i had turned

1177
00:42:54,130 --> 00:42:54,790
it on

1178
00:42:55,150 --> 00:42:57,040
it would have said like you can't

1179
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:59,140
connect or whatever cannot connect so here's

1180
00:42:59,530 --> 00:43:01,600
results valid it sounded like you at

1181
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:02,830
the beginning zoom errands

1182
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:06,910
you did not write that icon's

1183
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:10,930
so here's my ethics question on the

1184
00:43:10,930 --> 00:43:12,610
very last day my internet was still

1185
00:43:12,610 --> 00:43:14,613
not back the sunday is their last

1186
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:16,420
egg from the i was i was

1187
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:18,790
going to not have keep my streak

1188
00:43:18,790 --> 00:43:20,740
going and i've been proud of my

1189
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:22,240
streak yeah she should be

1190
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:25,330
it's something that keeps me going like

1191
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:26,980
some some weeks where it's like smelling

1192
00:43:27,050 --> 00:43:28,960
like a streak going exactly so i

1193
00:43:28,990 --> 00:43:30,490
guess all i'll at least get on

1194
00:43:30,490 --> 00:43:32,830
once this week or whatever so i

1195
00:43:32,890 --> 00:43:35,950
instead i still i had my phone

1196
00:43:35,950 --> 00:43:37,420
was you know not connected to the

1197
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:40,510
internet it's just like phone connections i

1198
00:43:40,510 --> 00:43:41,830
went on the peloton app and i

1199
00:43:41,830 --> 00:43:43,600
just let a ten minute long

1200
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:47,380
um class play without doing the class

1201
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:48,910
huh

1202
00:43:49,630 --> 00:43:51,550
so my streak would continue going now

1203
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:54,700
am i the asshole is this a

1204
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:58,030
true history that's fair given the fact

1205
00:43:58,030 --> 00:44:01,180
that you have you did ride or

1206
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:02,470
no you didn't know i didn't ride

1207
00:44:02,470 --> 00:44:04,286
that week oh no no no no

1208
00:44:04,286 --> 00:44:05,470
no no no no no but no

1209
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:06,700
but i don't want my streets to

1210
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:08,560
go down to zero it doesn't seem

1211
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:09,730
fair i

1212
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:11,080
no but wait so you did it

1213
00:44:11,350 --> 00:44:12,970
you put it on and how many

1214
00:44:12,970 --> 00:44:14,770
days have you not written according to

1215
00:44:14,770 --> 00:44:16,930
the peloton at that point it would

1216
00:44:16,930 --> 00:44:18,220
have been the entire it would have

1217
00:44:18,220 --> 00:44:19,690
been that was the seventh day it

1218
00:44:19,690 --> 00:44:21,520
would have been but so if you

1219
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:22,570
put in you put in the ten

1220
00:44:22,570 --> 00:44:25,090
minutes that means your streak continues because

1221
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:27,130
it's because i like typical i took

1222
00:44:27,130 --> 00:44:29,170
a class that week so much so

1223
00:44:29,170 --> 00:44:29,920
my streak contr

1224
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:31,270
menus even though i just let it

1225
00:44:31,270 --> 00:44:33,670
play and walked away i think this

1226
00:44:33,670 --> 00:44:35,200
is a classic i'll allow it but

1227
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:38,857
watch yourself counselor moment yes yes just

1228
00:44:38,950 --> 00:44:40,990
there should be eligible there should be

1229
00:44:40,990 --> 00:44:42,820
a middle ground where where i say

1230
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:44,200
hey i need to put my streak

1231
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:45,970
on pause because i'm going out of

1232
00:44:45,970 --> 00:44:49,570
town or or i'm out of internet

1233
00:44:49,570 --> 00:44:50,080
or something like

1234
00:44:50,110 --> 00:44:53,230
that hey there are circumstances i want

1235
00:44:53,230 --> 00:44:54,010
to take this all the way to

1236
00:44:54,010 --> 00:44:56,410
the top of peloton and just yeah

1237
00:44:57,410 --> 00:44:59,230
really appeal there there's gotta be an

1238
00:44:59,230 --> 00:45:01,600
appeals process with these streaks because like

1239
00:45:01,630 --> 00:45:03,340
you know these were circumstances beyond my

1240
00:45:03,340 --> 00:45:04,990
control and i say yeah we're gonna

1241
00:45:04,990 --> 00:45:07,300
do we're gonna do this miracle on

1242
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:09,250
thirty fourth street style we're gonna find

1243
00:45:09,250 --> 00:45:10,240
out where to sit

1244
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:13,210
send postcards and letters to peloton and

1245
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:14,953
i'm gonna dress up as santa yeah

1246
00:45:14,953 --> 00:45:16,930
yeah you don't have to but and

1247
00:45:16,930 --> 00:45:18,040
i'm gonna be the little girl to

1248
00:45:19,121 --> 00:45:20,860
like i have like a carnival like

1249
00:45:20,860 --> 00:45:22,570
one of those yesterdays where half the

1250
00:45:22,570 --> 00:45:25,060
highway's yeah you have only done on

1251
00:45:25,060 --> 00:45:26,590
tv shows i feel like where it's

1252
00:45:26,590 --> 00:45:28,660
like so like someone does half on

1253
00:45:28,660 --> 00:45:29,950
one side and half on the other

1254
00:45:29,980 --> 00:45:30,370
if you always

1255
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:31,990
feels like a tv show tv shows

1256
00:45:31,990 --> 00:45:34,270
on halloween like we've gone there i

1257
00:45:34,270 --> 00:45:36,640
think it's due to weimer germany if

1258
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:37,840
you're there to see some sort of

1259
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:38,710
cabernet

1260
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:41,890
so what's your idea of the listeners

1261
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:45,880
to flood flood peloton with cards a

1262
00:45:45,886 --> 00:45:48,580
letter saying please add a feature where

1263
00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:49,960
you can pause it if you're going

1264
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:53,500
out of town yeah that's true because

1265
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:55,090
that would be really frustrating you can't

1266
00:45:55,090 --> 00:45:56,740
travel with that fucking thing you know

1267
00:45:56,740 --> 00:45:59,110

like i want the average to be

1284
00:46:28,270 --> 00:46:30,670

to give you something

1318
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:47,650

coordinate with each other like like other

1327
00:48:02,050 --> 00:48:05,050
smartwatches do unfortunately suzanne it's like you

1328
00:48:05,050 --> 00:48:05,920
have two days

1329
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:08,500
it's ah at the same time like

1330
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:11,290
on a sitcom like three's company yes

1331
00:48:12,700 --> 00:48:14,260
for sure have you ever had two

1332
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:15,760
dates at the same time paul know

1333
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:16,420
what

1334
00:48:17,650 --> 00:48:18,790
i was like i'd ever have one

1335
00:48:18,790 --> 00:48:20,980
date at a time one date every

1336
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:23,560
couple of years oh wow wasn't that

1337
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:23,830
bad

1338
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:27,490
so true there's a few years and

1339
00:48:27,490 --> 00:48:29,290
there were there two years that i

1340
00:48:29,290 --> 00:48:29,890
had where

1341
00:48:31,150 --> 00:48:33,310
the lean years twenty three years twenty

1342
00:48:33,310 --> 00:48:36,760
five lean years and um yeah i'm

1343
00:48:36,763 --> 00:48:38,500
twenty three and twenty five yeah

1344
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:42,250
i'm afraid i'm assuming that my frame

1345
00:48:42,250 --> 00:48:44,560
of reference for the sitcom cliche of

1346
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:46,300
two days of the same time and

1347
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:47,650
having rushed back and forth is the

1348
00:48:47,650 --> 00:48:49,810
brady bunch that's what i think oh

1349
00:48:49,810 --> 00:48:51,430
yeah that one but it wasn't it

1350
00:48:51,430 --> 00:48:52,810
was peter ore and it was a

1351
00:48:52,810 --> 00:48:54,730
halloween thing where he had to address

1352
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:56,080
he had two different costumes that he

1353
00:48:56,080 --> 00:48:58,750
had to get it out of what

1354
00:48:58,810 --> 00:48:59,650
what do you think when you

1355
00:48:59,710 --> 00:49:01,030
think that do you have a sitcom

1356
00:49:01,270 --> 00:49:03,370
that you think of i think three's

1357
00:49:03,370 --> 00:49:05,410
company three's company i guess i just

1358
00:49:05,410 --> 00:49:08,710
think of like every thing ever there

1359
00:49:08,710 --> 00:49:09,850
must have been saved by the bell

1360
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:13,480
whoa my brain leaks sees every reason

1361
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:15,760
lightened um say by the bell

1362
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:18,160
yeah definitely feels like something that would

1363
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:19,540
be covered on one of those shows

1364
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:20,740
but i can't think of it right

1365
00:49:20,740 --> 00:49:22,600
now what a sloppy ass show that

1366
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:24,400
was that sometimes he came by the

1367
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:26,500
bell yeah but you get stop time

1368
00:49:26,507 --> 00:49:28,930
sometimes sometimes he couldn't like what if

1369
00:49:28,930 --> 00:49:30,400
you could stop time there's so many

1370
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:32,560
times you could have used that breeze

1371
00:49:32,890 --> 00:49:35,890
if i could turn back time everyone

1372
00:49:35,950 --> 00:49:36,610
to smile

1373
00:49:37,545 --> 00:49:39,220
he was invited to everything they did

1374
00:49:40,270 --> 00:49:42,220
that happened yeah that would be letters

1375
00:49:42,220 --> 00:49:43,780
made but everyone has a friend that

1376
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:45,760
you absolutely cannot stand you know like

1377
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:46,960

oh no i know but i'm troubled

1387
00:50:10,690 --> 00:50:13,810
troubled fellow troubled fellow and and perhaps

1388
00:50:14,230 --> 00:50:17,440
getting our kids into show business is

1389
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:19,780
not the right thing to do well

1390
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:21,610
unless you know there's enough directly into

1391
00:50:21,610 --> 00:50:21,970
porn

1392
00:50:23,230 --> 00:50:25,120
there is enough cases of it working

1393
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:26,169
out and there's enough cases of it

1394
00:50:26,169 --> 00:50:27,399
going poorly that you just ruined it

1395
00:50:27,399 --> 00:50:28,600
just like anything in life you just

1396
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:30,370
don't know exactly yeah maybe if you're

1397
00:50:30,370 --> 00:50:32,770
good parents your kids will be normal

1398
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:34,540
and be able to add yeah and

1399
00:50:34,540 --> 00:50:36,070
maybe if you're a piece of shit

1400
00:50:36,490 --> 00:50:38,710
and you're just exploiting your child you

1401
00:50:38,710 --> 00:50:40,748
should go to hell yeah look at

1402
00:50:40,748 --> 00:50:42,880
like haley joel who seems

1403
00:50:44,570 --> 00:50:45,680
he has a nice head on his

1404
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:47,630
shoulders his parents yeah he turned him

1405
00:50:47,630 --> 00:50:52,250
right to ah teach him well and

1406
00:50:52,250 --> 00:50:54,739
his sister and they seem fine absolut

1407
00:50:54,740 --> 00:50:56,690
but that seems sometimes to be the

1408
00:50:56,690 --> 00:50:58,580
exception i don't know lauren are you

1409
00:50:58,580 --> 00:51:00,500
going to lie i die first of

1410
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:01,970
all i'm putting holly into tv and

1411
00:51:01,970 --> 00:51:02,690
film student

1412
00:51:04,130 --> 00:51:06,830
she covered by media yeah i'm submitting

1413
00:51:06,830 --> 00:51:09,350
her on casting notices all every show's

1414
00:51:09,350 --> 00:51:12,320
your team oh my god i i

1415
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:14,660
don't plan to put her into that

1416
00:51:14,660 --> 00:51:17,540
but um when i think about that

1417
00:51:17,540 --> 00:51:19,520
though that the risk of that i

1418
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:21,770
honestly think it's it seems like there's

1419
00:51:21,770 --> 00:51:24,050
more cases where it's okay actually because

1420
00:51:24,110 --> 00:51:25,070
kind of hear about the ones where

1421
00:51:25,070 --> 00:51:26,900
it's crazy and you focus on them

1422
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:28,490
like people where it's kind of gone

1423
00:51:28,490 --> 00:51:29,630
downhill but it seems like there's a

1424
00:51:29,630 --> 00:51:30,740
lot of people i think it's when

1425
00:51:30,770 --> 00:51:33,110
when you're on something successful that's when

1426
00:51:33,110 --> 00:51:34,730
it's bad it's dangerous yeah because i

1427
00:51:34,743 --> 00:51:36,500
just kind of doing the countdown now

1428
00:51:36,535 --> 00:51:38,540
in your in your twenties is is

1429
00:51:38,540 --> 00:51:40,400
right here that's should always be like

1430
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:41,960
reading scripts and going like no this

1431
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:44,240
is too good and throw yeah yeah

1432
00:51:45,230 --> 00:51:47,360
well like marijke nationally they like they

1433
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:50,330
just great to be successful business women

1434
00:51:50,330 --> 00:51:53,240
yeah they're just too weird trolls who

1435
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:54,320
smoke all the time

1436
00:51:56,750 --> 00:51:57,890
that's my yea i don't think they're

1437
00:51:57,890 --> 00:51:59,510
trolls but i think you smoke a

1438
00:51:59,510 --> 00:52:02,030
lot um yeah they do smoke a

1439
00:52:02,030 --> 00:52:03,350
lot but i mean you know they're

1440
00:52:03,350 --> 00:52:04,820
busy new yorkers they got to a

1441
00:52:04,820 --> 00:52:06,110
certain point where i was like ok

1442
00:52:06,110 --> 00:52:07,280
now we don't have to do that

1443
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:10,610
anymore and we can do this um

1444
00:52:10,790 --> 00:52:12,800
that's what i'm hoping for with this

1445
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:14,900
show that you you don't have to

1446
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:15,680
do that anymore

1447
00:52:15,710 --> 00:52:18,140

and that thing you said sign of

1576
00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:35,000
my existence it was like i've because

1577
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,320
i would forget when it was happening

1578
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:38,390
right yeah not in the marathon where

1579
00:56:38,390 --> 00:56:40,550
the yeah your like yes yes yes

1580
00:56:41,330 --> 00:56:43,280
but but i watched it and it's

1581
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:44,480
like the worst

1582
00:56:44,510 --> 00:56:47,270
celebrities and you just really wish because

1583
00:56:47,300 --> 00:56:49,040
you know back in the fifties or

1584
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:50,390
whenever it started it would be people

1585
00:56:50,390 --> 00:56:51,650
like bob hope and stuff like that

1586
00:56:51,650 --> 00:56:53,030
so it's like yeah i'm a hunter

1587
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:55,310
you just want like good celebrities to

1588
00:56:55,310 --> 00:56:56,510
be in it but then that's all

1589
00:56:56,516 --> 00:56:58,430
you was watching i was watching it

1590
00:56:58,430 --> 00:57:00,290
this year but i think there's some

1591
00:57:00,290 --> 00:57:03,950
sort of weird right-wing cabal who is

1592
00:57:03,950 --> 00:57:04,640
involved in it

1593
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:08,600
it because everyone doing the the parade

1594
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:10,040
is like and hosting and everything is

1595
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:13,910
like erik estrada dean cain like all

1596
00:57:13,910 --> 00:57:17,360
of these weird jor like peterson yeah

1597
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:19,490
it's all these weird super right-wing people

1598
00:57:19,490 --> 00:57:21,740
see i think it's interesting i think

1599
00:57:21,740 --> 00:57:23,960
it might be like a religious parade

1600
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:24,530
or something like

1601
00:57:25,700 --> 00:57:28,100
aren't like good celebrities yeah it's probably

1602
00:57:28,190 --> 00:57:29,660
it's probably put on in conjunction with

1603
00:57:29,660 --> 00:57:32,120
some you know church or something like

1604
00:57:32,120 --> 00:57:33,290
that might be the salvation army do

1605
00:57:33,293 --> 00:57:34,160
they have something to do with it

1606
00:57:34,460 --> 00:57:36,410
oh maybe they so and they also

1607
00:57:36,410 --> 00:57:38,870
have these weird magicians doing close-up magic

1608
00:57:38,870 --> 00:57:40,190
like during the break they didn't have

1609
00:57:40,190 --> 00:57:43,040
normal ones they had weird ones

1610
00:57:44,300 --> 00:57:48,110
closer magic at a parade yeah it's

1611
00:57:48,110 --> 00:57:50,438
like really not great that's um

1612
00:57:50,801 --> 00:57:52,160
i think

1613
00:57:55,190 --> 00:57:57,530
he's gonna flow daily close order and

1614
00:57:57,800 --> 00:57:59,419
i think i think somebody's marching like

1615
00:57:59,420 --> 00:58:01,850
one card of ah a bunch of

1616
00:58:01,850 --> 00:58:03,950
magicians like as many magicians as would

1617
00:58:03,950 --> 00:58:05,720
be in a marching band marching doing

1618
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:09,020
magic tricks altogether i hate the same

1619
00:58:09,020 --> 00:58:10,160
trick i would love to see that

1620
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:11,735
actually yeah that would be great yeah

1621
00:58:12,170 --> 00:58:13,370
do think people the metal

1622
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:15,620
right now it's like masks on and

1623
00:58:15,620 --> 00:58:17,120
being like watching close-up magic with a

1624
00:58:17,120 --> 00:58:20,510
mask on yeah well we're actually i'm

1625
00:58:20,540 --> 00:58:22,910
going there very soon you are as

1626
00:58:22,970 --> 00:58:25,850
received an invitation from a member of

1627
00:58:25,850 --> 00:58:28,670
the magic time i've been forever yeah

1628
00:58:29,270 --> 00:58:32,390
yeah within like four years five years

1629
00:58:32,390 --> 00:58:33,470
gotta wear masks

1630
00:58:33,710 --> 00:58:34,910
um unless you're eating

1631
00:58:36,290 --> 00:58:37,550
or one thing i always thought was

1632
00:58:37,550 --> 00:58:38,840
kind of odd about that place is

1633
00:58:38,840 --> 00:58:41,840
that they required women to wear skirt

1634
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:44,450
yes i think that they require men

1635
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:47,390
to wear jackets and summer like but

1636
00:58:47,390 --> 00:58:49,520
like if you are someone who doesn't

1637
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:50,930
want to wear a skirt it's like

1638
00:58:50,930 --> 00:58:52,040
a really weird thing to have to

1639
00:58:52,040 --> 00:58:54,260
do well they've they have changed they

1640
00:58:54,260 --> 00:58:55,460
have ah um

1641
00:58:56,480 --> 00:58:59,180
modified that oh okay so you guys

1642
00:58:59,180 --> 00:59:00,770

a formal suit yeah okay well that's

1646
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:08,090

one of them yeah they would and

1763
01:03:25,145 --> 01:03:27,065
so this stenting you and with the

1764
01:03:27,065 --> 01:03:29,135
implication that you had to answer each

the trailer narrator and the other two

1948
01:09:05,135 --> 01:09:06,755
are acting and creating the dialogue for

1949
01:09:06,755 --> 01:09:08,915
the scenes as the trailer plays so

1950
01:09:08,915 --> 01:09:11,315

1952
01:09:13,145 --> 01:09:14,735
