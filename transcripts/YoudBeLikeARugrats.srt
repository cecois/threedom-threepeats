and she would look at it she

188
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:10,560
would look at the screen this is

189
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,610
in the middle of the orgy scene

190
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:13,290
she would look at the screen and

191
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:14,671
when she would look at the screen

192
00:06:14,671 --> 00:06:15,840
and there would be nothing going on

193
00:06:16,224 --> 00:06:17,640
and then she would hope and she

194
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,410
would turn away and talk to us

195
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:21,180
and then suddenly there'd be like some

196
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,880
some yeah well hardcore sex happening over

197
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,650

i've never seen that movie i never

230
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:36,060
but i counted as having watched it

231
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,280
but like like in the middle of

232
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,110
the thing you know it's a weird

233
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:40,680
movie to watch them

234
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:43,830
when they come out well his grandmother's

235
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:45,870
doing areas but what year did that

236
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:47,730
come out in the seventies or it

237
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:50,280
wasn't it wasn't was it ah who's

238
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:53,070
the pennant bob or like maybe very

239
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:55,080
early eighties but yeah bob guccione it

240
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,550
produced it or wasn't it a thing

241
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:57,780
where they shot it and it wasn't

242
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:58,920
all that great and so they put

243
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:00,930
like hardcore porn in it in order

244
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:01,920
to like that's a fix

245
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:05,235
it's it's one you almost did that

246
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:08,490
between two ferns i think ah you

247
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:10,015
did want edit where you say sentimental

248
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:13,290
formed from caligula yeah let's see where

249
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,450
zach is just watching colliculus goes full

250
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:19,470
screen on this slow funny might have

251
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:20,640
improved the move that would have been

252
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,080
great uh

253
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,880
um yeah it was did you ever

254
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,800
watch movies you weren't supposed to watch

255
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,580
and then you had to turn it

256
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:27,930
off when your parents got home having

257
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,130
natalie i'm trying to think if there

258
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:30,930
was anything that was actually that i

259
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:33,120
think raised who's scared problem i think

260
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,740
i usually would do it really coward

261
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,810
we also didn't have cable oh well

262
00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:38,790
you know what's weird here in l

263
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:41,100
a on my cowl nine or whatever

264
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,150
they would show

265
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:44,940
certain in syndication they would show certain

266
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:47,100
shows that had boobs in them benny

267
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,050
hill and i remember benny hill paul

268
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:51,570
hogan show i think crocodile dundee yet

269
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:52,800
to show he had a sketch show

270
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,180
or something like that before which is

271
00:08:54,337 --> 00:08:55,800
good is very popular yeah yeah yeah

272
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:58,170
and so so my parents would go

273
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:01,410
away and we would turn on these

274
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:02,160
shows

275
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:05,940
and it's in black and white and

276
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:07,830
it's like well we're that desperate to

277
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:09,750
see boobs but then like suddenly my

278
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,160
parents would come home because they forgot

279
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,598
something or something like that and we'd

280
00:09:12,598 --> 00:09:13,950
turn the tv off really quick and

281
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:15,510
then it got to be where my

282
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,910
my dad would like feel the team

283
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:19,080
to see if it was high

284
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:21,900
ah huh i and i probably have

285
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:23,370
told this story but i remember watching

286
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:26,010
kids my friends be oh yeah and

287
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:27,720
her older brother and the movie kids

288
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:31,170
yeah and it was so fucked up

289
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:33,420
and i just remembered no one caught

290
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:35,100
us nothing happened i just i was

291
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,110
haunted you know at a great argument

292
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:38,220
with a friend of mine about that

293
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:40,230
movie because i he was talking to

294
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:40,320
me

295
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,730
about it and i hadn't seen it

296
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:44,010
and i was like i don't eat

297
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:45,270
i don't want i'm i want to

298
00:09:45,275 --> 00:09:47,400
know about this yeah horrible well and

299
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,690
i was like the age of them

300
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:50,130
at the time like i was yeah

301
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,050
and oh yeah i was eight and

302
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:52,980
yeah and yeah i think it's way

303
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,690
weirder to watch it what's the right

304
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:56,160
age yeah watch kids i would say

305
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,240
being the same age as that would

306
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,860
be the best way to go what

307
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:00,450
about one year in my mind

308
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:02,895
yeah so you can aspire i was

309
00:10:02,895 --> 00:10:04,215
younger i was a little bit younger

310
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:05,745
but it won't be like seventeen but

311
00:10:05,745 --> 00:10:07,275
i sort of think there's something gross

312
00:10:07,275 --> 00:10:09,225
about watching it as an adult well

313
00:10:09,225 --> 00:10:10,635
yeah and we're just kind of my

314
00:10:10,665 --> 00:10:11,592
where i was coming from yeah it's

315
00:10:11,592 --> 00:10:12,525
like i don't want to see that

316
00:10:12,525 --> 00:10:14,175
and yeah like it's actually you know

317
00:10:14,175 --> 00:10:15,555
it's like really rough but there's some

318
00:10:15,555 --> 00:10:16,875
good performances and i'm like i don't

319
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:17,745
care i want to see it and

320
00:10:17,745 --> 00:10:19,245
we were then we got we got

321
00:10:19,245 --> 00:10:21,285
like genuinely we were genuinely argued

322
00:10:21,285 --> 00:10:23,445
being and then it all came to

323
00:10:23,445 --> 00:10:25,455
a head where he said

324
00:10:26,805 --> 00:10:29,205
all i'm saying is it wouldn't kill

325
00:10:29,205 --> 00:10:30,495
you if you saw it and then

326
00:10:30,495 --> 00:10:31,425

the baseball team really want and to

and he was like nope i'm concentrating

620
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:36,800
on basketball so i get that he

621
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,900
is he's very focused very focused young

622
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:40,160
men anyway but this is cool up

623
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:42,470
sister's first time meeting our nebo baby

624
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:46,383
and ah ah she was i was

625
00:20:46,399 --> 00:20:48,800
i was saying do you miss ah

626
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:49,070
your

627
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:51,440
her son being this age and she

628
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,510
goes yes because it goes so fast

629
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,120
and i was like it's feels like

630
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:59,150
it's taking no ever this is this

631
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:02,090
is the phrase that you'll hear over

632
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:04,790
and over again the days are long

633
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:09,050
but the years are short right wow

634
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:12,380
honestly wow these are preaching to and

635
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:15,290
that's shocking yeah it is really weird

636
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:16,580
it goes fast but it also feels

637
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:18,110
like every feels like the longest three

638
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:20,660
july yeah because it's like it's just

639
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,600
hours of yeah doing like nothing yeah

640
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:25,910
but um and here is so then

641
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:27,950
it led me to my theory which

642
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:29,390
is i think because

643
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:31,820
we all miss when people are babies

644
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:34,160
yeah everyone should when they wake up

645
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:36,290
be a baby and then they grow

646
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:37,460
to be an old man in a

647
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:39,200
single day and then they go to

648
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,091
sleep and they wake up babies lunch

649
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:44,060
everyone yeah oh i thought okay well

650
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:45,650
ah then i'll talk with the question

651
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:48,590
well you know what's great about it

652
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:49,730
it's a lot like that riddle of

653
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:52,460
like i mean who christ was god

654
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:53,780
let's get you know what's wrong with

655
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:55,520
this and i'm just realizing that what's

656
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,350
ah if everyone's baby who can take

657
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:58,400
care of each other you know well

658
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,510
no it's like the beach in old

659
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:01,310
where everyone's a baby for like you

660
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:02,930
know like half hour so we're all

661
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:04,370
like screaming our heads off and like

662
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:06,470
being ignored and like yeah meeting something

663
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:06,830
then you're

664
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:08,540
beginning and ending your day in a

665
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:11,000
diaper that sucks yeah i think we

666
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,470
should all be

667
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:15,800
wake up twenty five go to bed

668
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:19,940
fifty nine fifty add ten to that

669
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,040
i'm in ok

670
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:25,040
he said it he wants to why

671
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,089
do you want to die they don't

672
00:22:26,089 --> 00:22:28,160
want to be young younger than twenty

673
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,660
five well i think you want to

674
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:30,620
be able to rent a car the

675
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:32,420

the brain i would assume right i

684
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,150

685
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:49,669
the opportunity to have our our the

686
00:22:49,669 --> 00:22:51,950

687
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:54,170

see them again yeah and it's it's

800
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:38,390
such a terrible feeling there are some

801
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:40,910
place there's sometimes where it's like i

802
00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:43,100

803
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:44,030

do a show every other month yeah

808
00:26:52,490 --> 00:26:55,640
at this venue and it's using just

809
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:57,710
enough time to forget to forget the

810
00:26:57,710 --> 00:26:59,090
name every single but know the face

811
00:26:59,134 --> 00:27:01,786
yeah yeah that is tricky and there's

812
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:04,010
some people where i think what happens

813
00:27:04,010 --> 00:27:04,190
is

814
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:06,470
there's sort of an assumed we know

815
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:08,150
each other's name thing so no one

816
00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:10,790
ever says it yeah and then you

817
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:12,770
never can say it or yeah they

818
00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:13,910
like if if you're working at a

819
00:27:13,910 --> 00:27:15,170
theater something where someone comes up to

820
00:27:15,170 --> 00:27:16,370
give you some information and you don't

821
00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:17,090
get their name cause they're getting the

822
00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:19,820
information and then later like i wish

823
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:21,230
i had asked what their name is

824
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:22,550
that i can know that i know

825
00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:23,960
and then honestly what used to help

826
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:24,350
me a lot

827
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:25,910
it was we had a mailing list

828
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:27,890
when i first started comedy yeah i

829
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:30,110
just got everyone's and i would email

830
00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:32,000

all out you know and so i

834
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:42,020
knew every single person's name because i

835
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:43,280
was used to looking at them all

836
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:44,420
yeah yeah yeah yeah

837
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:47,420
um and i was talking to jenny

838
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:50,570
lewis from ah music about that because

839
00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:52,760
i was on her mailing list i

840
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:54,080
was on her mailing list and so

841
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,460
that's how she knew my name for

842
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:57,950
so many years wow um and she

843
00:27:57,950 --> 00:27:58,940
brought that up the last time i

844
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:00,200
saw her she's like oh remember our

845
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:02,090
mailing list and how you brought this

846
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:03,800
up so yeah yeah mailing lists are

847
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:04,550
a good way to go

848
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:06,440
yeah yeah well i mean i think

849
00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:07,880
instagram can be very helpful with that

850
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,050
but then sometimes someone has a name

851
00:28:09,050 --> 00:28:10,940
that's like of weird version of their

852
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:13,520
new and then you remember that yeah

853
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:15,620
speaking of being reunited with people you

854
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:17,330

855
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:18,647

turns out it's been a while last

857
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:25,460
night but i had a long dream

858
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:27,380
that we were

859
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:32,060
we were shooting the second season of

860
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:35,750

861
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:37,910

with the reboots and all these things

866
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:45,710

947
00:31:27,805 --> 00:31:29,365
