00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,400
they came or went any

189
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,660
nowhere i just can't believe i missed

190
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:28,710
all of that in my room and

191
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:29,760
i was only a few doors i

192
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,080
know they were right across the hall

193
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,960

194
00:07:33,963 --> 00:07:36,990

having this big discussion about whatever it's

199
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:46,560
so irritating when people leave hotel

200
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,950
lz they should be quiet because people

201
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:51,660
are sleeping but everyone just thinks when

202
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:52,830
they walk out of a hotel room

203
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:54,990
they're like well i no longer am

205
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,470

257
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:36,450
woken me up and and your cell

258
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:37,530
phone would not have woken you up

259
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:39,540
because it was on silent executive but

260
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,620
sleepy tired sleepy sleepy town so the

261
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:44,550
wicked child saved the day the wicked

262
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:46,020

263
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:47,640
to the airport for our two hour

264
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,030
delay

265
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:51,570
that's right well you got there right

266
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:52,920
before we're gonna start boarding yeah they

267
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:55,140
literally two two minutes before you're boarding

268
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,210
and you said do i have time

269
00:09:57,210 --> 00:09:59,010
to get some to eat and i

270
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:00,900
said no they're boarding then immediately they

271
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,970
said oh by the way you have

272
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:03,960
time to get something to eat paul

273
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:05,130
so then i was able to get

274
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:07,080
extreme i love you mr tompkins sweet

275
00:10:07,479 --> 00:10:09,360
again but yeah i

276
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,500
and i guess i'll never do that

277
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,240
again which sucks because i really liked

278
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,470
it as a plan well it could

279
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:16,150
work can i here's here's the question

280
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:17,320
that i can't trust maybe you need

281
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,760
to like leave your phone here's a

282
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,920
question i have was there something on

283
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,870
the menu card that said you have

284
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:24,910
to leave it before this time or

285
00:10:25,523 --> 00:10:27,010
pick it up because sometimes they have

286
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:28,870
words that's on the cardano and before

287
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:30,100
miller know i had it on

288
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:32,410
because they didn't pick it up the

289
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:34,210
night before and i thought like oh

290
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:35,710
because i had the do not disturb

291
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:37,900
sign over it so i used the

292
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:40,300
same card that same day so it

293
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:41,920
was absolutely it was out there for

294
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,050
twenty four hours yeah all day long

295
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,870
okay yeah okay if they didn't pick

296
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:48,910
it up the night before i maybe

297
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:49,810
would have set an alarm

298
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,610
well but i thought i thought the

299
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:56,710
problem was they couldn't see it right

300
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:58,240
because either do not disturb sign over

301
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,580
it right still and then that's probably

302
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:03,100
what it was no this time that

303
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:05,290
thing was outfront i think this was

304
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:07,060
their phone this was there by the

305
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:08,710
way the other thing chevron just er

306
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:10,480
chef kevin reminds me of is

307
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,700
is that there was a big problem

308
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:15,400
with the with getting the rooms and

309
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:17,470
there was like an additional form that

310
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:18,820
i need to fill out once we

311
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:20,770
got there with the credit card that

312
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:22,000
was not my credit card it was

313
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:23,500
it was my assistance credit card and

314
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,370
they're like well if you don't have

315
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:25,990
this form then we can't accept payment

316
00:11:26,050 --> 00:11:27,940
it's got us stealing his sister's identity

317
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:30,640
and i was like but their rooms

318
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:31,840
or paid for already you know all

319
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:32,980
sorts of stuff and then at a

320
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:34,420
certain point i was getting so frustrated

321
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:36,640
and i said why is this more

322
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,260
complicated than any other hotel we've been

323
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:40,120
to and the the woman said we're

324
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,950
downtown huh

325
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,900
she did that wasn't i made no

326
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:46,750
sense it all happens here we're downtown

327
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:49,060
so i guess downtown is the excuse

328
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:50,050
for why they don't pick up the

329
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:52,210
menu cards or anything i tell you

330
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:53,500

400
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,810

410
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:17,620

00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:57,910
comedy show but also kind of a

555
00:18:57,910 --> 00:19:00,490
real thing for a morning show huh

556
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:02,980
and the gimmick was it would happen

557
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:05,350
very late at night so it could

558
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:06,520
be called the first

559
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:10,000
morning show so it would come along

560
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,980
like well one yeah exactly yeah yeah

561
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:15,880
and ah it was a weird experience

562
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:18,820
it was not um they were trying

563
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:20,620
to find a co-host and they for

564
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:22,150
some reason like asked me for a

565
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:23,230
list of people that i would like

566
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:25,510
to coast with a completely ignored that

567
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:26,680
amazing yeah

568
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,940
they said what about this one person

569
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:29,140
said i don't i don't think she's

570
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:31,090
like great and they're like okay great

571
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:31,870
it's gonna be her

572
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:36,280
it's gonna be hard then um the

573
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,349
the and i kept asking these were

574
00:19:38,349 --> 00:19:40,030
guys that i knew that were doing

575
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:41,740
and i kept asking like are we

576
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:43,450
gonna look bringing it into people that

577
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:45,190
i had suggestions to like do a

578
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:47,470
test or whatever and they just wouldn't

579
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:49,362
respond to me it was so weird

580
00:19:49,362 --> 00:19:51,850
that's maddening and then so then we

581
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:53,200
did the pilot and

582
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,000
and ah you know it didn't get

583
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,190
picked up then they tried to sell

584
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:59,830
it to another network did not mention

585
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:02,920
it to me at all um and

586
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:05,650
ah try to sell it with somebody

587
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:07,720
else the network didn't somebody else in

588
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:10,000
place of you yes now the network

589
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,590
didn't like that guy but they had

590
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:13,090
already said no to me because they

591
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:13,360
saw

592
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:16,880
pilot right the one who'd still called

593
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,740
me up still asked if i would

594
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:24,740
audition again for this new network that

595
00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:26,450
already said they didn't want me

596
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:30,200
it was so embarrassed it was like

597
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,690
the most funky request i ever got

598
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,280
docs like what do you think is

599
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,410
going to happen what what happens accept

600
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:39,590
i'm humiliated now on this show was

601
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:43,130
it real or scripted there were real

602
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:45,350
interviews and also like their scripted bits

603
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:47,060
but then the interviews were were real

604
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:47,810
were very much like a

605
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:50,870
one show interview so who but yeah

606
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,340
would i still want to know your

607
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:54,230
answer the show was a mess well

608
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:55,010
but i still don't know what i

609
00:20:55,010 --> 00:20:55,910
would do i would do a show

610
00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:57,170
like that yeah i thought that's the

611
00:20:57,441 --> 00:20:58,430
show that i would do yeah i

612
00:20:58,430 --> 00:20:59,720
think it'd be fun would you ever

613
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:03,424
do that scott i thought look my

614
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:05,330
eric potential job prospects are few and

615
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:07,730
far between so yeah do anything

616
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:11,809
yeah yeah very self-deprecating lately what this

617
00:21:11,809 --> 00:21:14,510
about your ashes you're anxious about the

618
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:16,610
film maybe baby i don't know but

619
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,340
i think doing a morning show i

620
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:20,360
was thinking about this the other day

621
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,380
because i was like

622
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:23,690
you know when i first started doing

623
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:27,380
comedy van gang ah i was sort

624
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:29,510
of thinking like ah because my friend

625
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:30,624
had the morning show at indy one

626
00:21:30,624 --> 00:21:31,880
of three i was like it would

627
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,380
be fun to do the morning show

628
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,870
and indie one or three and i

629
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:38,060
think just like it would maybe be

630
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:39,500
fun for a week i think it

631
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:40,520
would be like a fun thing to

632
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,410
do to guest for a week but

633
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:42,500
to

634
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,820
do it every day i just can't

635
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:45,860
imagine doing the well the kelly lee

637
00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:50,000

642
00:21:58,580 --> 00:21:59,960
do a mixture of talking to people

643
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:02,690

yeah cathy rigby

667
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:48,920
the kelly ripa show that seems a

668
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,060
little more like you can have your

669
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:51,860
personality and age it's a little more

670
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:53,480
singular and they talk about their own

671
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,250
lives a lot like don't be like

672
00:22:55,370 --> 00:22:56,690
i just was watching yesterday and the

673
00:22:56,690 --> 00:22:58,430
hotel was getting ready and it was

674
00:22:58,430 --> 00:23:01,460
like um she's like telling this long

675
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:04,370
story that was really boring and i

676
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:06,170
was like i know the feeling luckily

677
00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:07,250
you and i are yummy

678
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:10,340
chris saved the day it just was

679
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:11,570
so weird cause i was like wow

680
00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:12,650
she just has this platform she can

681
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:13,640
just talk about anything and like they

682
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,350
had to fill hours so obviously i'm

683
00:23:15,361 --> 00:23:17,330
gonna be gold yeah and i also

684
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:18,950
know i feel very you know what

685
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:20,810
i'm not this slam on you it's

686
00:23:20,810 --> 00:23:23,870
a slam on everything we show yeah

687
00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:26,360
it's true it's true it's true strew

688
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:27,440
oh

689
00:23:27,621 --> 00:23:28,790
you still like them all and i

690
00:23:28,790 --> 00:23:29,930
think it's a fun it takes a

691
00:23:29,930 --> 00:23:31,430
lot of energy and a lot of

692
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:33,290
personality or if you could if you

693
00:23:33,290 --> 00:23:35,450
could i think you would have to

694
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:38,540
choose one or the other either having

695
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:40,460
a show like that for death or

696
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:42,770
or being like an actress oh i'd

697
00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:43,970
be an actress you'd be an actress

698
00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:45,440
why is it way more fun i

699
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,600
want to be acting more fun than

700
00:23:47,662 --> 00:23:49,280
you'd then yeah but i mean this

701
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,510
is a form of that is it

702
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:52,940
not it is but um don't you

703
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,710
prefer i mean i've referred play character

704
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:56,990
about you paul i like playing characters

705
00:23:57,020 --> 00:24:00,200
i do like interviewing people but it

706
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:04,730
can get um ah tedious you can

707
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:06,800
get tedious to because not every constantly

708
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:07,700
interested in other people

709
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:10,670
well yeah because lotta not everyone meets

710
00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:13,460
you halfway yeah so kenny loggins would

711
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,710
he would always be driveway but then

712
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:16,850
he'll take you to the danger zone

713
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:18,950
yeah that's true that's the price you

714
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:20,420
pay but it's true like when even

715
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:21,860
when you're doing a podcast and someone

716
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:24,140
like doesn't really hold up their end

717
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:27,020
of the conversation yeah like this isn't

718
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:27,920
fun anymore

719
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:30,800
yeah yeah yeah the drag i think

720
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,240
that they're doing a late night talk

721
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,380
show it used to be something that

722
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:34,820
i really wanted to do but then

723
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:36,230
it just seems boring to me now

724
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:38,030
having to talk to all these randoms

725
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:39,800
yeah i think that's something that i

726
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:41,420
that's definitely something that i used to

727
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:42,560
want to do but i don't think

728
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:43,790
i wanna do that anymore i think

729
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:44,600
it was just i wanted to be

730
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,100
a comedian because that's where yeah he

731
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:48,080
was yeah man you know someone

732
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,280
it was a variety show man that's

733
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:51,860
what i wanna do yeah man variety

734
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:53,330
that is what you should do and

735
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:54,740
that is what would be a that

736
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:56,390

737
00:24:56,390 --> 00:24:59,480

00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:01,520
executives listen to our show and give

739
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:01,940
us away

740
00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:05,090
if you think do you think like

743
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:13,130
networks and stuff like even care about

744
00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:16,010
entertainment like they wouldn't listen to their

745
00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:18,140
favorite podcasts and i think i'd be

746
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:20,090
so inundated with stuff all the time

747
00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:22,190
that they're like not then seeking it

748
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:23,450
out in their free time i think

749
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,160
every time i go into it any

750
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,570
kind of meeting someone says i love

00:25:26,570 --> 00:25:27,710
the rpm show awesome

752
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:30,260

753
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,510

754
00:25:32,639 --> 00:25:35,270

on you're probably gonna shit on yeah

766
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,570
i wonder if a snake does get

767
00:25:56,570 --> 00:25:57,260
shit on a lot

768
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,350
like a snake is down there on

769
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:02,750
the ground solicitor it's just around jody

770
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:04,700
run under like shit is going to

771
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:07,730
drop not everyone shits and toilets at

772
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:09,500
a certain point that is true at

773
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:11,240
a certain point someone's going to shit

774
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,800
and a snake will be underneath what

775
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,540
do you what do you mean someone

776
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:18,440
someone something somewhere

777
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:20,750
somehow are you talking about birds i'm

778
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:22,430
talking about birds talking about wolves i'm

779
00:26:22,430 --> 00:26:24,290
talking about people i'm talking about anything

780
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:26,660
that shits is gonna eventually shit on

781
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:27,800
a snake and the snake's gonna be

782
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:30,290
like hey what about me i think

783
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:33,260
i i would bet that shaped snakes

784
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:34,430
do not get shit on as much

785
00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:35,720
as you think they do i but

786
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:38,540
okay theres they're long and thin so

787
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:38,690
i

788
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,160
we'll give you yeah it would be

789
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:42,560
easier miss them eve hard target i

790
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:45,440
also think that your god i also

791
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,690
think that they're not about so much

792
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:49,370
about sneaking up on animals that are

793
00:26:49,370 --> 00:26:52,640
larger than themselves yeah so that to

794
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,650
catch an animal unawares in that way

795
00:26:54,770 --> 00:26:56,030
where the animals just like did to

796
00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:57,380
it too this is a good place

797
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:58,520
to shit no snakes around

798
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,860
i think it's very rare i think

799
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:02,960
that they're not looking at each other

800
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,700
i think that the things shitting the

801
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:06,410
hume the human the mammal whatever it

802
00:27:06,410 --> 00:27:08,930
is shitting is not thinking about a

803
00:27:08,930 --> 00:27:11,540
snake is just merely shitting than the

804
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:13,460
snake is merely going about it's business

805
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:16,040
and boom collide you're listening to time

806
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:18,710
it's like a person walking in front

807
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:19,040
of a bill

808
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,450
building in somebody dumped something out of

809
00:27:20,450 --> 00:27:24,500
the building yes exactly which is what

810
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:25,820
you've been shit on by a bird

811
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:27,680
have united course i yeah many times

812
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,840
in your life once just once yeah

813
00:27:30,290 --> 00:27:32,420
that seems i think the credit whoa

814
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:33,620
that i know

815
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:35,810
you do have a dripping down your

816
00:27:35,810 --> 00:27:39,140
background but i was ah wasn't remember

817
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:40,790
maybe i've just been shit on by

818
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:43,520
birds more because we're called ah yep

819
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:45,560
it's easier to reach me you've been

820
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,004
you've been shooting a bunch i don't

821
00:27:47,004 --> 00:27:48,470
even know if i have once growing

822
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:52,220
up not no not really no but

823
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:54,800
i think my elementary tomba bird

824
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:57,140
birds my elementary school i think there

825
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:59,210
were a lot of segal's or what

826
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,890
are the pigeons i don't know but

827
00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:03,770
always like hanging around or they dancer

828
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:06,530
although like you know but what do

829
00:28:06,530 --> 00:28:08,570
you mean you don't know you know

830
00:28:08,570 --> 00:28:10,610
the difference between pigeon steals they're both

831
00:28:10,610 --> 00:28:13,160
whites they both know they're not they

832
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,960
both speak bird

833
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:19,400
bird tower dong than the dance this

834
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:21,050
one's by the sea we weren't by

835
00:28:21,050 --> 00:28:22,010
the sea so it couldn't have been

836
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,660
probably pigeon that is probably the sea

837
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,880
so are you by them this wasn't

838
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:26,630
cso

839
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:29,660
i'm just saying there were a lot

840
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:32,210
of birds who were constantly shitting and

841
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:34,670
so people would get shit on alright

842
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,320
fair yeah that makes sense i mean

843
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,000
if you're in a in a concentrated

844
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,620
bird area yeah i guess you would

845
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:41,060
get shit on but that's i i

846
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:43,400
would think that everyone's elementary school there

847
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:45,380
would be a lot of birds is

848
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:47,540
what are you because there's so much

849
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:47,840
food

850
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:50,210

00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,550
high because we've seen this is the

853
00:28:55,550 --> 00:28:56,990
difference i'm saying i grew up in

854
00:28:56,990 --> 00:28:59,120
california and everyone ate trying to be

855
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,710
outside equalling more time to get shit

856
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:03,440
on why wouldn't you eat inside because

857
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,030
no one need they had lockers outside

858
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:06,980
too you should have eaten inside you

859
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:07,760
wouldn't get shit on by

life together can i tell you it

1028
00:35:30,545 --> 00:35:34,385
was sure fred belford fred belford i've

1029
00:35:34,385 --> 00:35:36,546
seen him and relatively recently moved from

1030
00:35:36,546 --> 00:35:39,815
a very funny comedian and um so

1031
00:35:39,815 --> 00:35:41,885
we were just catching a very briefly

1032
00:35:42,035 --> 00:35:45,035
and he has a he's married now

1033
00:35:45,155 --> 00:35:47,255
as a stepchild and ah

1034
00:35:47,285 --> 00:35:48,635
a normal child

1035
00:35:50,345 --> 00:35:53,435
a redhead um and he's and i

1036
00:35:53,435 --> 00:35:56,405
said oh congratulations and ah how's janey

1037
00:35:56,405 --> 00:35:57,965
and i said she's good and ah

1038
00:35:58,325 --> 00:35:59,855
there was like a moment i there

1039
00:35:59,855 --> 00:36:01,115
was like a moment of hesitation then

1040
00:36:01,115 --> 00:36:03,695
we talked about how it is if

1041
00:36:03,695 --> 00:36:05,735
you haven't seen someone so weird questionnaire

1042
00:36:05,825 --> 00:36:07,625
so yeah i'd say how is the

1043
00:36:07,625 --> 00:36:09,185
person you're married to i don't ask

1044
00:36:09,185 --> 00:36:10,295
you to people who've been married for

1045
00:36:10,295 --> 00:36:12,155
for a week i mean a year

1046
00:36:12,155 --> 00:36:13,925
you know something something sure i don't

1047
00:36:13,925 --> 00:36:16,085
ask anyone about anything about their lives

1048
00:36:16,085 --> 00:36:18,305
i haven't seen the the significant other

1049
00:36:18,305 --> 00:36:19,085
in a while and they have been

1050
00:36:19,085 --> 00:36:21,005
posting or something yeah and they're not

1051
00:36:21,005 --> 00:36:22,865
with them you better believe that exactly

1052
00:36:22,865 --> 00:36:26,585
imo but it's technically it's not rude

1053
00:36:26,585 --> 00:36:27,785
to ask because the last time you

1054
00:36:27,785 --> 00:36:29,375
saw someone they were married know used

1055
00:36:29,375 --> 00:36:30,455
to be a very normal quest

1056
00:36:30,485 --> 00:36:32,825
oh yeah and technically and and even

1057
00:36:32,825 --> 00:36:34,445
if the person is divorced the the

1058
00:36:34,445 --> 00:36:35,885
person should be able to say like

1059
00:36:35,915 --> 00:36:37,475
oh no we were not together anymore

1060
00:36:37,535 --> 00:36:39,125
it wouldn't be chicken shamed

1061
00:36:40,355 --> 00:36:42,515
it's sad they failed yes in the

1062
00:36:42,515 --> 00:36:44,555
it's a sin me bro they broke

1063
00:36:44,555 --> 00:36:46,355
the holy compact yeah i don't know

1064
00:36:46,385 --> 00:36:47,915
you failed being miserable for the rest

1065
00:36:47,915 --> 00:36:48,875
of your life don't ever tell you

1066
00:36:48,875 --> 00:36:50,555

given two weeks to live

1306
00:45:25,050 --> 00:45:27,990
live two weeks to live you would

1307
00:45:28,710 --> 00:45:31,800
eat a bunch of garbage and wash

1308
00:45:32,190 --> 00:45:34,590

would you this is a weird why

1311
00:45:40,860 --> 00:45:42,000
think if i were given two weeks

00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:44,880
your loved ones or would you say

1314
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:47,100
immediately within the first minute goodbye loved

1315
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:48,570
ones i have other stuff i have

1316
00:45:48,570 --> 00:45:49,770
to do it spend it with them

1317
00:45:49,770 --> 00:45:52,950
just talking just talking about what about

1318
00:45:52,950 --> 00:45:55,110
life and life their lives i mean

1319
00:45:55,110 --> 00:45:57,310
that's what i've learned and what i

1320
00:45:57,494 --> 00:45:57,575
do

1321
00:45:57,720 --> 00:46:00,210
would you record everything that you in

1322
00:46:00,210 --> 00:46:02,280
podcast form while you were doing it

1323
00:46:03,050 --> 00:46:04,167
in order to pass it down do

1324
00:46:04,167 --> 00:46:07,170
you hope should you ever have children

1325
00:46:07,170 --> 00:46:09,570
and ah we're not saying if that's

1326
00:46:09,570 --> 00:46:10,920
something that you want or whether it's

1327
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:12,690
something that you don't want ah haha

1328
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:16,080
but do you hope that they listen

1329
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:17,850
to this show in particular

1330
00:46:17,850 --> 00:46:19,950
her and i guess this episode or

1331
00:46:19,950 --> 00:46:21,840
any episode and say wow i really

1332
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:23,610
got to know mom you know i

1333
00:46:23,610 --> 00:46:26,250
think that's kind of neat at some

1334
00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:27,930
point for them to listen but i

1335
00:46:27,930 --> 00:46:30,270
imagine that would only become interesting to

1336
00:46:30,270 --> 00:46:31,890
them once they're in their like twenties

1337
00:46:31,890 --> 00:46:34,350
or thirties i don't think young kids

1338
00:46:34,410 --> 00:46:36,030
would care about that or think like

1339
00:46:36,030 --> 00:46:37,710
it's cool that you do this you

1340
00:46:37,710 --> 00:46:37,860
know

1341
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:40,050
i do wonder about the children of

1342
00:46:40,050 --> 00:46:43,920
people who have a who have art

1343
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:45,960
that's out there for the public consumption

1344
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:50,130
whether they legitimately are interested in ah

1345
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:51,540
for instance i was talking to someone

1346
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:52,950
yesterday who told me that they were

1347
00:46:52,950 --> 00:46:54,990
on a ah they had one acting

1348
00:46:54,990 --> 00:46:56,310
job in their life when they were

1349
00:46:56,370 --> 00:46:58,170
in in high school and they

1350
00:46:58,170 --> 00:46:59,970
iran like a teen soap opera and

1351
00:46:59,970 --> 00:47:01,080
that's the only thing they've ever done

1352
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:02,460
this was like i've known this person

1353
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:03,480
for a while and it was like

1354
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:05,910
shocking to me ah that they did

1355
00:47:05,910 --> 00:47:07,710
two seasons on a teen soap opera

1356
00:47:07,710 --> 00:47:08,880
and i was like well do your

1357
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:10,260
children know and it's like no they

1358
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:12,540
don't know yet but i think it

1359
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:14,310
would be interesting to know that about

1360
00:47:14,970 --> 00:47:16,830
you know yeah well they'll be crazy

1361
00:47:16,830 --> 00:47:18,210
reveal if i found out my

1362
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:19,800
mom had been on a team so

1363
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:20,880
powerful but you didn't tell me until

1364
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:22,560
i was like nineteen right i'd be

1365
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:24,120
like why don't i know this well

1366
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:25,830
you just said they that this show

1367
00:47:25,830 --> 00:47:27,930
shouldn't be listened to until know i

1368
00:47:27,930 --> 00:47:30,900
just imagined they won't care to hear

1369
00:47:30,930 --> 00:47:33,660
ah there was their model talking about

1370
00:47:33,690 --> 00:47:35,400
like stuff that yeah that is relevant

1371
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:36,841
to them at that age right maybe

1372
00:47:36,841 --> 00:47:38,160
they'd be more interesting i think young

1373
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:38,490
kids

1374
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:39,510
don't really care what their parents do

1375
00:47:39,510 --> 00:47:41,490
for a living i would lie to

1376
00:47:41,490 --> 00:47:42,630
my children and tell them that i

1377
00:47:42,630 --> 00:47:45,090
did a really cool thing yeah too

1378
00:47:45,210 --> 00:47:45,960
i would tell them i was the

1379
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:47,160
first man to walk on the moon

1380
00:47:47,250 --> 00:47:49,110
and see how long it would take

1381
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:51,150
and they would go to school and

1382
00:47:51,150 --> 00:47:52,710
they would be like my dad is

1383
00:47:52,710 --> 00:47:53,850
an astronaut and was the first man

1384
00:47:53,850 --> 00:47:54,990
to walk on the people would be

1385
00:47:54,990 --> 00:47:56,970
like no i don't think so just

1386
00:47:56,970 --> 00:47:58,260
see how long i could get away

1387
00:47:58,260 --> 00:47:58,650
with this

1388
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:00,420
what have you set my children up

1389
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:01,980
for pain and failure have you heard

1390
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:04,200
of greta thunberg that yeah sixteen year

1391
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:06,360
old activist yeah no climate change and

1392
00:48:06,390 --> 00:48:08,040
oh yeah yeah she's really awesome and

1393
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:09,450
she there was this great interview with

1394
00:48:09,450 --> 00:48:11,070
her on the daily show recently which

1395
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:13,350
i think everyone should watch but she

1396
00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:15,600
um she more of a jon stewart

1397
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:17,820
is in the middle ah well yeah

1398
00:48:17,820 --> 00:48:18,810
but it's more about what she's say

1399
00:48:18,810 --> 00:48:19,800
ng is what i i'm more of

1400
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:20,760
a bill maher guy

1401
00:48:22,980 --> 00:48:26,400
but she says she's not doing the

1402
00:48:26,850 --> 00:48:29,160
ah flying strike because it hasn't so

1403
00:48:29,190 --> 00:48:30,690
that is one of the biggest cum

1404
00:48:30,750 --> 00:48:32,550
tributes to climate change so she's not

1405
00:48:32,550 --> 00:48:35,250
flying she just took a no emissions

1406
00:48:35,250 --> 00:48:38,010
boat ride from um i believe sweet

1407
00:48:38,010 --> 00:48:40,500
into new york or something and she's

1408
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:42,510
only sixteen and her mom is an

1409
00:48:42,510 --> 00:48:42,810
opera singer

1410
00:48:42,810 --> 00:48:44,310
her and her mom had also is

1411
00:48:44,310 --> 00:48:46,350
doing this flight strike and and now

1412
00:48:46,350 --> 00:48:48,390
changed her career to be doing musical

1413
00:48:48,390 --> 00:48:50,520
theatre instead of opera and trevor noah

1414
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:52,560
was like because because she wouldn't fly

1415
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:53,550
for it and trevor noah i was

1416
00:48:53,550 --> 00:48:54,450
like oh how do you feel about

1417
00:48:54,450 --> 00:48:56,550
your mom changing her job for you

1418
00:48:56,550 --> 00:48:57,810
know these this belief and she was

1419
00:48:57,810 --> 00:49:00,600
like i don't really care about my

1420
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:02,940
mom's job she is

1421
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,890
aspergers it's also kind of rather oh

1422
00:49:04,950 --> 00:49:06,359
so that's how we all really feel

1423
00:49:06,359 --> 00:49:07,410
but i think it's true that when

1424
00:49:07,410 --> 00:49:08,550
you're like a teen you're like i

1425
00:49:08,550 --> 00:49:09,960
don't care but if you were a

1426
00:49:09,990 --> 00:49:11,520
problem yeah like if you gotta show

1427
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:13,230
it's i guess i'm not a famous

1428
00:49:13,230 --> 00:49:15,330
parent would you care i think i

1429
00:49:15,330 --> 00:49:16,710
think half the kids would be like

1430
00:49:16,710 --> 00:49:17,910
that's so awesome i want to be

1431
00:49:17,910 --> 00:49:19,620
like my parent and half of them

1432
00:49:19,620 --> 00:49:21,330
be like oh god i'm so embarrassed

1433
00:49:21,330 --> 00:49:23,130
by my yeah yeah i

1434
00:49:23,130 --> 00:49:25,560
yeah i think about that a lot

1435
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:27,360
like what it's like to be the

1436
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:30,360
child of a famous person and how

1437
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:34,890
you would resist that pull to want

1438
00:49:34,890 --> 00:49:36,510
to do what they'd right i mean

1439
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:40,020
because it probably looks great you know

1440
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:41,340
i mean yeah it probably looks really

1441
00:49:41,340 --> 00:49:43,200
cool yeah april

1442
00:49:43,470 --> 00:49:45,420
maybe they would and maybe the parents

1443
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:46,770
are only showing the perks and they're

1444
00:49:46,770 --> 00:49:48,270
trying to hide the bad stuff you

1445
00:49:48,270 --> 00:49:51,210
know from the kids mostly are trying

1446
00:49:51,210 --> 00:49:52,165
to show them the bad stuff and

1447
00:49:52,165 --> 00:49:54,090
it's not working out right yeah only

1448
00:49:54,090 --> 00:49:55,500
sees the perks it's like yeah you

1449
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:56,910
seem to complain a lot but your

1450
00:49:56,910 --> 00:49:58,500
life seems pretty great to me yeah

1451
00:49:58,740 --> 00:50:00,990
nah i guess being a kid is

1452
00:50:01,050 --> 00:50:03,060
is you're constantly like in so much

1453
00:50:03,060 --> 00:50:03,450
fear

1454
00:50:03,450 --> 00:50:05,670
ir and worried about judgement and stuff

1455
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:07,920
and then to cease people coming true

1456
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:10,200
for everyone while children are a cowardly

1457
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:12,870
superstitious but seeing people come up to

1458
00:50:12,870 --> 00:50:14,460
your parents and saying like hey you're

1459
00:50:14,460 --> 00:50:16,740
great is something that maybe wouldn't happen

1460
00:50:16,740 --> 00:50:18,300
for a lot of kids like right

1461
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:20,490
because the constant hey you're great you're

1462
00:50:20,490 --> 00:50:22,200
great you know i mean sure you

1463
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:23,580
had a very happy childhood lauren

1464
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:25,170
but i was also full of worry

1465
00:50:25,170 --> 00:50:27,840
and fear yeah i was i related

1466
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:28,620
to you but i was just saying

1467
00:50:28,620 --> 00:50:29,670
i bet there are kids who would

1468
00:50:29,670 --> 00:50:31,260
be like i wasn't the only that

1469
00:50:31,260 --> 00:50:34,500
stuff right but just to see people

1470
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:35,610
at the end even if it just

1471
00:50:35,610 --> 00:50:38,640
seems surface level constantly so you know

1472
00:50:38,730 --> 00:50:42,030
it's giving people praise and adulation yeah

1473
00:50:42,060 --> 00:50:43,770
it must seem very alluring

1474
00:50:44,435 --> 00:50:45,815
two kids but they you know the

1475
00:50:45,815 --> 00:50:47,315

the players who get the hot seat

let kevin player game with us so

1521
00:52:45,365 --> 00:52:46,775
the player in the hotseat draws three

1522
00:52:46,775 --> 00:52:48,665
cards and reads them privately the player

1523
00:52:48,665 --> 00:52:48,845
in the

1524
00:52:48,935 --> 00:52:51,335
hc chooses one card to play one

1525
00:52:51,335 --> 00:52:52,925
to give to another player and one

1526
00:52:52,925 --> 00:52:54,545
to discard if given a card the

1527
00:52:54,545 --> 00:52:55,715
player keeps it face down and must

1528
00:52:55,715 --> 00:52:56,765
play it on their next turn okay

1529
00:52:56,765 --> 00:52:59,345
there's so many rules everyone including the

1530
00:52:59,345 --> 00:53:00,454
player in the hot seat writes and

1531
00:53:00,454 --> 00:53:01,655
answer to the card in play on

1532
00:53:01,655 --> 00:53:03,125
their answer pad from the perspective of

1533
00:53:03,125 --> 00:53:05,195
the player in the hot seat does

1534
00:53:05,195 --> 00:53:06,545
kevin know how to play already the

1535
00:53:06,545 --> 00:53:08,075
player the huntsman collects the answers and

1536
00:53:08,075 --> 00:53:09,095
resold them out loud moving

1537
00:53:09,125 --> 00:53:10,925
clockwise each player guesses which answer was

1538
00:53:10,925 --> 00:53:11,975
written by the player in the hot

1539
00:53:11,975 --> 00:53:14,345

said t-birds it's a fifty fifty chance

1652
00:57:40,055 --> 00:57:41,315
that you said t bird but i

1653
00:57:41,345 --> 00:57:41,735
actually

1654
