00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:38,730
it we don't talk about it enough

173
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:38,880
that

174
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:42,660
there is something about the body that

175
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:44,220
is too it's almost too much to

176
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:47,580
get around that lighting that's a child

177
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:49,410
being like for example the original freaky

178
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:50,700
friday a child being in a mother's

179
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,800
body and then suddenly you're like i'm

180
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:54,810
this body you could just like they

181
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:57,060

00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:59,040
to their anything besides their face

183
00:06:59,138 --> 00:07:01,770

body which is fun for the parents

188
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:13,380

wasn't a choice first player but i

291
00:11:08,715 --> 00:11:10,035
mean it's the same like you're doing

292
00:11:10,035 --> 00:11:11,655
the same stuff like like he could

293
00:11:11,655 --> 00:11:12,975
have been a bodybuilder behold on it

294
00:11:12,975 --> 00:11:14,175
he could have been but he wasn't

295
00:11:14,175 --> 00:11:15,795
scott that's a crucial distinction you did

296
00:11:15,795 --> 00:11:17,145
not well not seen him in a

00:11:17,145 --> 00:11:18,795

a day

309
00:11:42,135 --> 00:11:43,875

00:11:53,265 --> 00:11:56,775
a private helicopter to the grammys performs

318
00:11:58,725 --> 00:11:59,295

just yeah definitely singing is ninety eight

331
00:12:25,455 --> 00:12:26,595
percent confidence

332
00:12:27,765 --> 00:12:31,035
and two percent skill maybe and one

333
00:12:31,035 --> 00:12:34,365
percent the hot leaving the president freaky

00:13:57,255 --> 00:13:59,535
theories one way or another by um

374
00:13:59,535 --> 00:14:01,335
i went to the i went to

375
00:14:01,335 --> 00:14:03,645
the place where he was killed when

376
00:14:03,645 --> 00:14:04,875
i was in dallas and went into

377
00:14:04,875 --> 00:14:06,375
the building where they showed where

378
00:14:06,405 --> 00:14:07,935
it was yeah because the museum is

379
00:14:07,935 --> 00:14:10,695
built a plaza he was not killed

380
00:14:10,695 --> 00:14:12,855
in the depository well killed in the

381
00:14:12,855 --> 00:14:14,685
car but i'm saying you got the

382
00:14:14,715 --> 00:14:17,175
museum is built so that you can

383
00:14:17,175 --> 00:14:19,365
go through and then see the actual

384
00:14:19,365 --> 00:14:20,895
point where the person was standing where

385
00:14:20,895 --> 00:14:22,695
they shot the gun who would you

386
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:23,475
say the person is

387
00:14:24,645 --> 00:14:27,285
um lee harvey oswald yeah there you

388
00:14:27,285 --> 00:14:29,055
go do some tab as well

389
00:14:30,195 --> 00:14:30,495
awesome

390
00:14:32,175 --> 00:14:33,795
and he was too or something

391
00:14:36,075 --> 00:14:37,155
i don't know when he was killed

392
00:14:37,755 --> 00:14:39,675
umm so i'm dead

393
00:14:42,004 --> 00:14:43,995
i was gonna come down and i'm

394
00:14:43,995 --> 00:14:44,505
saying

395
00:14:45,765 --> 00:14:46,635
god i feel like it's like an

396
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:48,045
idiot but i'm saying like oh i

397
00:14:48,045 --> 00:14:50,175
went to that museum and i stood

398
00:14:50,175 --> 00:14:51,165
there and i'm saying so then they

399
00:14:51,165 --> 00:14:53,145
think they figured out where he's shot

400
00:14:53,145 --> 00:14:54,345
from all these different things and they're

401
00:14:54,345 --> 00:14:56,375
saying it wasn't him who's who's hussein

402
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:59,055
this people seriously about everything so so

403
00:14:59,055 --> 00:15:00,495
kevin costner the movie kind of goes

404
00:15:00,495 --> 00:15:02,595
through all the the reasons that they

405
00:15:02,745 --> 00:15:04,485
don't think it was him because of

406
00:15:04,485 --> 00:15:05,895
like the angles of the bullets

407
00:15:05,925 --> 00:15:08,475
stone match and all this kind of

408
00:15:08,475 --> 00:15:10,755
stuff so everyone thinks that like there

409
00:15:10,755 --> 00:15:12,405
were what there is at least another

410
00:15:12,405 --> 00:15:14,625
shooter in the bushes essentially you know

411
00:15:14,699 --> 00:15:17,475
that a frames early harvey oswald you

412
00:15:17,475 --> 00:15:18,915
know he was a patsy who sort

413
00:15:18,915 --> 00:15:20,175
of took the fall because he was

414
00:15:20,175 --> 00:15:21,645
just like some dumb shit you know

415
00:15:21,885 --> 00:15:23,985
and then he was killed shortly thereafter

416
00:15:23,985 --> 00:15:26,055
by jack ruby who die

417
00:15:26,055 --> 00:15:29,025
died of cancer and ah it's it's

418
00:15:29,025 --> 00:15:30,135
all there's a lot of stuff that

419
00:15:30,135 --> 00:15:32,265
if you look at it does seem

420
00:15:32,295 --> 00:15:36,045
extremely fishy but the the outcomes razor

421
00:15:36,135 --> 00:15:39,105
explanation just is the clearest one it's

422
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:40,875
like yeah one guy killed you you

423
00:15:40,875 --> 00:15:43,005
think by now someone who knew would

424
00:15:43,005 --> 00:15:44,265
have come out and said like oh

425
00:15:44,265 --> 00:15:45,555
by the way because people can just

426
00:15:45,585 --> 00:15:46,185
just can't keep

427
00:15:46,215 --> 00:15:47,625
a secret like that it does seem

428
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:50,175
impossible they couldn't even keep watergate secret

429
00:15:50,175 --> 00:15:51,225
for that long you know what i

430
00:15:51,225 --> 00:15:52,545
mean even the judas in the black

431
00:15:52,545 --> 00:15:54,885
messiah dude like came out on sixty

432
00:15:54,885 --> 00:15:57,105
minutes was like oh yeah yeah i

433
00:15:57,375 --> 00:15:58,690
i worked with ah who was at

434
00:15:58,690 --> 00:16:00,495
the fbi or the cia began to

435
00:16:00,495 --> 00:16:02,505
watch fbi but but yeah like even

436
00:16:02,505 --> 00:16:03,855
he couldn't keep his mouth shut and

437
00:16:03,855 --> 00:16:05,805
it ruined his life yeah wow he

438
00:16:05,835 --> 00:16:06,375
killed himself

439
00:16:06,375 --> 00:16:08,685
lf later that week yeah because of

440
00:16:08,685 --> 00:16:11,325
it it just seems impossible that somebody

441
00:16:11,355 --> 00:16:12,285
that they could keep a secret for

442
00:16:12,285 --> 00:16:15,045
that long however i don't it it

443
00:16:15,045 --> 00:16:16,905
doesn't seem entirely out of the realm

444
00:16:16,905 --> 00:16:18,945
of possibility it's enough that nuts to

445
00:16:18,945 --> 00:16:19,935
fill that makes us there was a

446
00:16:19,935 --> 00:16:21,855
conspiracy yeah so that there was another

447
00:16:21,855 --> 00:16:23,745
person and or whatever and that they

448
00:16:23,895 --> 00:16:26,415
framed somebody but like if they could

449
00:16:26,565 --> 00:16:28,455
i'm roger rabbit i mean kimi for

450
00:16:28,455 --> 00:16:30,675
him anyway because he's so savvy

451
00:16:31,815 --> 00:16:35,955
no honey bunny rabbit if so what

452
00:16:35,985 --> 00:16:38,085
is the theory that the the that

453
00:16:38,085 --> 00:16:39,795
you're saying part of the conspiracy thing

454
00:16:39,795 --> 00:16:41,865
is that the president knows who really

455
00:16:41,865 --> 00:16:42,915
did it or that kind of thing

456
00:16:42,915 --> 00:16:44,985
like people well they they let the

457
00:16:44,985 --> 00:16:46,875
president in on like all of these

458
00:16:46,875 --> 00:16:49,305
secrets when they become president and that's

459
00:16:49,305 --> 00:16:51,285
pretty exciting that is one that people

460
00:16:51,285 --> 00:16:51,765
think

461
00:16:52,005 --> 00:16:53,805
you know oh yeah that's probably something

462
00:16:53,805 --> 00:16:55,965
that the cia knows about or whatever

463
00:16:55,965 --> 00:16:58,305
and it's ufos and who killed j

464
00:16:58,305 --> 00:16:59,625
f k seemed to be the two

465
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:00,945
major ones paul can you think of

466
00:17:00,945 --> 00:17:02,895
any other one oh moon landing that's

467
00:17:02,895 --> 00:17:04,695
my moonlight oh yeah that's my favorite

468
00:17:04,695 --> 00:17:07,575
one that didn't really happen yes which

469
00:17:07,575 --> 00:17:10,065
is just like what is that yeah

470
00:17:10,725 --> 00:17:12,135
the the hardest thing went all

471
00:17:12,165 --> 00:17:13,739
we talked about hello okay okay go

472
00:17:14,295 --> 00:17:15,945
on there again in which is the

473
00:17:15,945 --> 00:17:17,145
part that i find weird i'm like

474
00:17:17,145 --> 00:17:18,855
well then if it's so easy easy

475
00:17:18,855 --> 00:17:20,051
and we've already did it we are

476
00:17:20,051 --> 00:17:22,455
we've already did in the sixties vardy

477
00:17:22,485 --> 00:17:25,605
didn't really do it again that's when

478
00:17:25,605 --> 00:17:26,895
people start going we're going back to

479
00:17:26,895 --> 00:17:28,275
the moon it's like who gives a

480
00:17:28,275 --> 00:17:30,075
shit did we see that there wasn't

481
00:17:30,105 --> 00:17:31,035
anything up there

482
00:17:33,075 --> 00:17:34,215
i think there is an ah there

483
00:17:34,215 --> 00:17:37,605
is ah an a notion to to

484
00:17:37,605 --> 00:17:39,465
make a base on the moon that

485
00:17:39,465 --> 00:17:42,075
would then be a way for us

486
00:17:42,075 --> 00:17:45,675
to get to mars easier i i

487
00:17:45,915 --> 00:17:47,595
really don't want to go to mars

488
00:17:48,765 --> 00:17:50,716
yeah you better get used to it

489
00:17:50,716 --> 00:17:53,115
because that's where we're all going yeah

490
00:17:53,625 --> 00:17:55,365
i mean we'll in twenty twenty four

491
00:17:55,515 --> 00:17:56,745
yeah we'll go there in a couple

492
00:17:56,745 --> 00:17:58,725
of years i mean yeah i don't

493
00:17:58,725 --> 00:17:59,475
know if i would go to mars

494
00:17:59,475 --> 00:18:00,945
maybe if i was an old man

495
00:18:00,975 --> 00:18:01,935
you know what i mean if i

496
00:18:01,935 --> 00:18:03,375
was like a widower and i had

497
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:06,735
nothing left going on i'm retired and

498
00:18:06,735 --> 00:18:08,295
talk about this every six episode we

499
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:08,745
honest so

500
00:18:08,925 --> 00:18:10,875
we honestly we haven't explored this angle

501
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:13,485
before right now it did around the

502
00:18:13,485 --> 00:18:14,955
moon seemed fresh it does yeah i

503
00:18:14,955 --> 00:18:16,035
would go to the moon but i

504
00:18:16,035 --> 00:18:17,475
would only go to mars i think

505
00:18:17,475 --> 00:18:18,825
if it was like because you're not

506
00:18:18,825 --> 00:18:20,989
coming back from that trip in our

507
00:18:21,015 --> 00:18:23,325
lifetimes i don't think anyone likes to

508
00:18:23,325 --> 00:18:25,485
take together like three weeks right here's

509
00:18:25,485 --> 00:18:26,475
what i would like something like we

510
00:18:26,487 --> 00:18:27,525
lifted up by some i think

511
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:30,075
you said it was like we say

512
00:18:30,075 --> 00:18:31,995
the same things we're so stupid

513
00:18:33,015 --> 00:18:37,695
yeah if um if paul paul if

514
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:38,985
you went to the moon let's say

515
00:18:38,985 --> 00:18:42,345
you were like ninety nine yeah and

516
00:18:42,435 --> 00:18:45,105
janie had passed to it umm you

517
00:18:45,105 --> 00:18:47,115
know that three days three days early

518
00:18:47,265 --> 00:18:51,075
yeah okay she's so she's ninety days

519
00:18:51,075 --> 00:18:51,375
early

520
00:18:53,145 --> 00:18:54,705
she's she also got to live a

521
00:18:54,705 --> 00:18:56,925
very long time she's in these as

522
00:18:56,925 --> 00:18:57,165
well

523
00:18:58,335 --> 00:19:00,424
then you go to the moon and

524
00:19:00,525 --> 00:19:03,825
it would be like comedian perlis tamkins

525
00:19:04,155 --> 00:19:05,113
gu i don't know why the new

526
00:19:05,115 --> 00:19:07,725

he's the last person who remembers me

528
00:19:10,245 --> 00:19:13,875
ah those to the moon and then

529
00:19:13,875 --> 00:19:14,985
you're you're on the moon and you're

530
00:19:14,985 --> 00:19:16,695

shit um that by the way is

635
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,020
my favorite bit to do when someone

636
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:35,430

00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:37,230

job or something yeah because i like

667
00:24:38,850 --> 00:24:40,440
i would look at like robin williams

668
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,570
i was in a church play i

669
00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:44,550
remember donkey

670
00:24:46,050 --> 00:24:48,330
where it was like there was this

671
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:52,470
christian sketch group that i remember would

672
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:55,200
play knott's berry farm during during the

673
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:57,570
christian band times that i would go

674
00:24:57,570 --> 00:24:59,340
there and see certain white christian bands

675
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:03,450
like like ah striking see talk and

676
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,520

any other steve taylor striper harman i

679
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:11,100
actually i did see amy grant there

680
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:12,900
and michael w smith i believe i

681
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:14,940
saw both of them but um so

682
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:16,350
there's this christian sketch group who would

683
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:17,820
do like basically like leave it to

684
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:20,220
beaver parodies and stuff like that who

685
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:22,380
the but have a christian message at

686
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:23,670
the end you know and so i

687
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:25,110
remember we put on one of em

688
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:25,980
at the church

689
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:27,870
sj ah and i was cast in

690
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:30,390
it and i was like imitating a

691
00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:32,940
tv switching channels and i was doing

692
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:35,460
all the programs kind of stuff you

693
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:38,280
know it's like yeah and the funny

694
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,900
thing was i wasn't like sticking to

695
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:41,610
the script i was like throwing in

696
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,010
some hot it's something i wasn't around

697
00:25:44,130 --> 00:25:45,690
but that's the thing i wasn't improvising

698
00:25:45,690 --> 00:25:46,140
like i

699
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,000
it was doing the same thing all

700
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,050
the time but i was just kind

701
00:25:49,050 --> 00:25:49,980
of like it was more like i

702
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:51,390
was doing punch up but i thought

703
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:54,000
it was improv so i remember and

704
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,620
this is so mortifying but i remember

705
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:57,480
when i when the directors of it

706
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,400
said hey we're gonna do another show

707
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,950
the year later i was kind of

708
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:03,570
like i knew i was the big

709
00:26:03,570 --> 00:26:05,310
hit of the shows i was wow

710
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:06,270
so sort of like

711
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:08,310
um could i improv in this one

712
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:10,350
and they were like yeah sure like

713
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:11,640
they didn't give a shit like when

714
00:26:11,730 --> 00:26:15,750
no one noticed you change ah how

715
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:17,310

i mean i i was tens i'm

737
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:09,420

741
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,270
they do show other whoa i was

742
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:19,020
theirs mother will

743
00:27:19,061 --> 00:27:20,280
follow up from the baby well but

744
00:27:20,282 --> 00:27:21,690
we were like come out of this

745
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:24,030
little interstitials and like the whole a

746
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:26,010
little thing about that show is beast

747
00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:27,420
is the weird one

748
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,780
i literally held a mixing bowl i

749
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:32,820
came on stage held mixing mothers they

750
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:34,740
go wolf and then i would like

751
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:37,410
improvise things but i also think it

752
00:27:37,410 --> 00:27:39,330
probably wasn't improvised because that just sounds

753
00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:40,860
gonna be a total train wreck and

754
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:42,000
now that i think about it where

755
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,800
you like repeating jokes you knew worked

756
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:45,900
yes it's probably the same thing where

757
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,790
i was like we got to improvise

758
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:48,780
but it was like you

759
00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:50,070
doing like the hanukkah song

760
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:52,530
i just came out and had like

761
00:27:52,530 --> 00:27:55,020
little funny things as like levity i

762
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:56,580
mean but i can imagine what it

763
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:58,290
really would be would be like the

764
00:27:58,290 --> 00:28:00,330
long silence as i walk out and

765
00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:01,830
then like we say something where does

766
00:28:01,833 --> 00:28:03,810
the spotlight finds us and then like

767
00:28:03,810 --> 00:28:05,940
we leave and everyone's like he or

768
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:08,340
whatever right and it feels amazing because

769
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:10,440
like we crushed we crushed i mean

770
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,340
and and expe

771
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:13,260
stations are low in like ah those

772
00:28:13,290 --> 00:28:15,720
situations from from an audience standpoint so

773
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:18,540
for stone crushing really yeah thank you

774
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:20,460
think there's i pay money to see

775
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:20,820
the show

776
00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:23,557
i you get me into the church

777
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:26,070
you mean i like oddly yeah ties

778
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:29,520
if my nephew comes with the show

779
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:34,890
included the show included thinking this super

780
00:28:34,890 --> 00:28:36,510
savvy grid go show included

781
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,960
if i if my nephews did a

782
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,400
play i would love to go watch

783
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,870
i would love to watch a little

784
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:45,000
children's play i went to go see

785
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:48,150
ah mt and morgan walsh's kid be

786
00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:49,500
in a play once it was really

787
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:50,880
fun like cool off i went to

788
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,080
go see them in a little shop

789
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,400
of horrors and it was so funny

790
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:56,280
because they had multiple kids playing the

791
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,870
same part yeah so like

792
00:28:57,930 --> 00:28:59,370
to most knicks would come out and

793
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:02,010
say their lines simultaneously so it's yeah

794
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:04,320
it's insane it's so why why like

795
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,180
that why not like i know why

796
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:08,160
not switch them off yeah performance know

797
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:10,380
even basic scene by scene or something

798
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:14,040
it was so funny silly simultaneously talking

799
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,840
like just have all the kids playing

800
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:18,060
the part dress the same and then

801
00:29:18,122 --> 00:29:20,280
they just come in and out no

802
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:22,080
explanation it's just like whenever they go

803
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,760
off stage a new kid comes on

804
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:25,290
it's super confusing so this was just

805
00:29:25,290 --> 00:29:27,030
yeah it was just that more kids

806
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:28,590
could get the chance to yeah yeah

807
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:30,870
because because there were no there was

808
00:29:30,870 --> 00:29:32,940
no pretense about the show being good

809
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:34,590
yeah that was what i loved about

810
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:36,390
it it was like look these are

811
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:38,220
these are five to six year olds

812
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:40,080
i'm not gonna be a good show

813
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,400
really little we just want to get

814
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,110
them out there to have the experience

815
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:44,850
and like you know have all the

816
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:46,770
adults taking pictures and something that's being

817
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:48,450
able have a story to tell later

818
00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:49,260
when they're on a date

819
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,410
i like the idea of having someone

820
00:29:52,410 --> 00:29:53,910
you said in sync with because then

821
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:55,350
if you forget what the line is

822
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:58,800
here they all forget you forgot yeah

823
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:01,020
i don't think a single person remembered

824
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:03,510
any of the lines was so what

825
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:05,100
if there was someone on stage on

826
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:06,600
a broadway play the same way there

827
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,130
is with children's theatre like like the

828
00:30:08,130 --> 00:30:09,990
teacher is there like trying to give

829
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:10,620
people q

830
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,510
since i mean i know they they

831
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:13,560
they say all the time such a

832
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:15,480
cliche that that's the actor's nightmare whatever

833
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:17,460
i literally have that nightmare like once

834
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:18,630
in a while and it's sort of

835
00:30:18,630 --> 00:30:21,330
like scary thing ever yeah it is

836
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,800
like you're like i have no clue

837
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,480
i was in like hamilton and dream

838
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,830
i had and i was like i

839
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:27,510
don't know what's going on i don't

840
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:28,950
know who i am i know there's

841
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:30,780
an expectation i know i know

842
00:30:31,428 --> 00:30:34,555
always fucked up and forgotten a memorize

843
00:30:34,555 --> 00:30:37,225
the lines over the like previous three

844
00:30:37,225 --> 00:30:39,775
months yeah i've always liked procrastinated on

845
00:30:39,775 --> 00:30:40,855
it and then one day it's like

846
00:30:40,855 --> 00:30:41,815
hey by the way you gotta go

847
00:30:41,815 --> 00:30:43,345
on tonight it's like fuck i know

848
00:30:43,345 --> 00:30:46,525
yeah well anyway lot is sorry sorry

849
00:30:46,525 --> 00:30:47,275
what i get a lot as i've

850
00:30:47,275 --> 00:30:49,945
memorized the wrong thing oh and then

851
00:30:49,945 --> 00:30:51,355
they say okay we're doing this and

852
00:30:51,355 --> 00:30:51,535
i'm

853
00:30:51,565 --> 00:30:53,635
saying ivo were doing the other one

854
00:30:53,665 --> 00:30:54,565
they're like nope

855
00:30:56,395 --> 00:30:57,775
when i would do that community theater

856
00:30:57,775 --> 00:31:00,025
stuff i was always really really nervous

857
00:31:00,025 --> 00:31:01,555
about forgetting my lines and i that

858
00:31:01,555 --> 00:31:03,235
was so stressful like the memorizing was

859
00:31:03,235 --> 00:31:05,395
the hardest part and then as you

860
00:31:05,395 --> 00:31:07,225
get older it's like because i always

861
00:31:07,225 --> 00:31:09,805
think like broadway seems so intimidating half

862
00:31:10,015 --> 00:31:11,755
just because of the memorization and i'd

863
00:31:11,755 --> 00:31:12,985
be like nervous that i would mess

864
00:31:12,985 --> 00:31:14,905
it up but like i do feel

865
00:31:14,905 --> 00:31:15,265
like you're

866
00:31:15,295 --> 00:31:17,390
brain gets into a rhythm with memorization

867
00:31:17,395 --> 00:31:18,745
and oh yeah i'm so much easier

868
00:31:18,745 --> 00:31:21,085
it's always so funny when someone comes

869
00:31:21,085 --> 00:31:23,305
out and jumps ahead in the script

870
00:31:23,815 --> 00:31:25,255
because this would happen at a high

871
00:31:25,255 --> 00:31:27,295
school not the like pro shows that

872
00:31:27,295 --> 00:31:29,755
i did but like in high school

873
00:31:29,935 --> 00:31:32,875
sometimes like pages and pages would be

874
00:31:32,875 --> 00:31:35,455
skipped like like fifth

875
00:31:35,455 --> 00:31:37,495
eighteen pages someone comes on and does

876
00:31:37,675 --> 00:31:39,415
something from fifteen and then and then

877
00:31:39,415 --> 00:31:41,365
it's like everyone backstage is going oh

878
00:31:41,365 --> 00:31:43,195
no he's skipped fifteen pages what do

879
00:31:43,195 --> 00:31:45,445
we do and then it's it's like

880
00:31:45,445 --> 00:31:47,635
somehow trying to maneuver them into getting

881
00:31:47,635 --> 00:31:49,495
back on track of the pre because

882
00:31:49,495 --> 00:31:51,175
you know something needs to happen in

883
00:31:51,175 --> 00:31:52,525
those fifteen pages to make the whole

884
00:31:52,525 --> 00:31:54,415
thing right so funny so let me

885
00:31:54,486 --> 00:31:55,555
be like yeah we get to go

886
00:31:55,675 --> 00:31:56,635
denny's even earlier

887
00:31:58,375 --> 00:31:59,905
but i always kind of feel like

888
00:31:59,905 --> 00:32:01,795
if something gets skipped in a show

889
00:32:01,795 --> 00:32:04,675
that means that it's not important you

890
00:32:04,675 --> 00:32:05,695
know what i mean like anytime i

891
00:32:05,695 --> 00:32:07,255
was doing comedy and i would forget

892
00:32:07,255 --> 00:32:08,995
a bit in in part of a

893
00:32:08,995 --> 00:32:10,135
bit i was doing i was always

894
00:32:10,135 --> 00:32:11,455
like oh that's the part that should

895
00:32:11,455 --> 00:32:13,555
have been cut out yeah yeah i

896
00:32:13,555 --> 00:32:15,235
remember it then it's it's although i

897
00:32:15,235 --> 00:32:16,735
have done that on stage where i've

898
00:32:16,735 --> 00:32:17,905
tried to do an old bit

899
00:32:17,965 --> 00:32:19,765
and forgotten i did it on tv

900
00:32:19,765 --> 00:32:21,985
once i do i do a tv

901
00:32:21,985 --> 00:32:23,965
spot and this australian when i was

902
00:32:24,085 --> 00:32:25,675
doing an australian ah i was doing

903
00:32:25,675 --> 00:32:27,595
the melbourne festival and i got this

904
00:32:27,595 --> 00:32:30,685
tv spot and i had i had

905
00:32:30,685 --> 00:32:32,005
like a small it was a very

906
00:32:32,005 --> 00:32:33,595
small amount of time for the sep

907
00:32:33,595 --> 00:32:34,435
so i was like ok i'm gonna

908
00:32:34,435 --> 00:32:36,025
do an old bit because all those

909
00:32:36,025 --> 00:32:37,015
old bits are shorter

910
00:32:38,155 --> 00:32:39,385
and i thought i could just do

911
00:32:39,385 --> 00:32:41,305
it from memory and i forgot a

912
00:32:41,425 --> 00:32:43,825
co rusal part of the bit and

913
00:32:43,825 --> 00:32:46,045
no one was laughing like i just

914
00:32:46,045 --> 00:32:50,125
completely i just completely like edited that

915
00:32:50,125 --> 00:32:52,375
out of my mind and went on

916
00:32:52,375 --> 00:32:55,255
and i skipped like i cannot tell

917
00:32:55,255 --> 00:32:56,395
i cannot stress enough if you go

918
00:32:56,425 --> 00:32:58,255
back what made the bit good

919
00:32:58,405 --> 00:33:00,145
was this piece of information that i

920
00:33:00,147 --> 00:33:01,435
by the way i'm talking about a

921
00:33:01,435 --> 00:33:04,735
ghost well yeah i feel like with

922
00:33:04,735 --> 00:33:06,325
any sort of standup thing like that

923
00:33:06,475 --> 00:33:08,605
you need every word of it even

924
00:33:08,605 --> 00:33:10,165
if you think yeah parts not that

925
00:33:10,465 --> 00:33:12,325
yeah to it's like it just makes

926
00:33:12,325 --> 00:33:14,065
the rhythm right and yeah although if

927
00:33:14,065 --> 00:33:15,355
you're i don't know i feel like

928
00:33:15,655 --> 00:33:17,455
sometimes when i was doing standup if

929
00:33:17,515 --> 00:33:18,415
if you're in the moma

930
00:33:18,415 --> 00:33:19,885
ain't enough and you skip a bit

931
00:33:20,245 --> 00:33:21,565
as long as you're communicating what you

932
00:33:21,565 --> 00:33:23,185
need to say it's like oh i

933
00:33:23,185 --> 00:33:24,925
didn't need that stuff yeah well sometimes

934
00:33:24,925 --> 00:33:26,935
your mind edits that way naturally like

935
00:33:26,935 --> 00:33:28,765
when you're trying out material it kind

936
00:33:28,765 --> 00:33:31,555
of automatically goes to the parts that

937
00:33:31,555 --> 00:33:33,475
work better yeah and then you kind

938
00:33:33,475 --> 00:33:34,495
of look back and you realize oh

939
00:33:34,495 --> 00:33:36,175
yeah i didn't need to be throwing

940
00:33:36,175 --> 00:33:37,555
that in there sometimes you'll have you'll

941
00:33:37,555 --> 00:33:38,575
go back and go like oh

942
00:33:38,605 --> 00:33:39,715
oh shit i forgot that was a

943
00:33:39,715 --> 00:33:41,065
really funny part and then you go

944
00:33:41,515 --> 00:33:42,955
it was just dragging the pace down

945
00:33:43,045 --> 00:33:44,875
so who's trying to base town it

946
00:33:44,875 --> 00:33:46,675

some reason everyone's obsession recently it's always

00:34:38,395 --> 00:34:40,345
it was take my drag yeah that's

971
00:34:40,345 --> 00:34:41,755
how i felt he should have acted

972
00:34:41,755 --> 00:34:43,735
to me and instead he was like

973
00:34:44,155 --> 00:34:46,615
i'm so nervous and i was like

974
00:34:46,675 --> 00:34:49,765
what what's i mean no no no

975
00:34:49,765 --> 00:34:50,875
not to me just to do the

976
00:34:50,875 --> 00:34:54,565
show oh do the show lord he

977
00:34:54,565 --> 00:34:55,735
doesn't give a shit about me but

978
00:34:55,735 --> 00:34:56,575
he was like so whew

979
00:34:56,575 --> 00:34:58,225
germany's just like i'm so nervous i'm

980
00:34:58,225 --> 00:35:00,415
like you're late you're gonna be fine

981
00:35:00,415 --> 00:35:03,055
when no matter what happens yeah brow

982
00:35:03,145 --> 00:35:04,285
i mean it just feels like it's

983
00:35:04,285 --> 00:35:07,375
so much easier on non comedians to

984
00:35:07,375 --> 00:35:09,235
do a show like that because you

985
00:35:09,265 --> 00:35:11,455
there's no expectation for you to say

986
00:35:11,455 --> 00:35:12,784
or do anything funny you just have

987
00:35:12,803 --> 00:35:14,605
to that's also that's also like they're

988
00:35:14,605 --> 00:35:16,045
not used to being funny in the

989
00:35:16,046 --> 00:35:16,735
situation so

990
00:35:16,735 --> 00:35:18,925
so they feel a big expectation of

991
00:35:18,925 --> 00:35:20,065
like oh shit what if no one

992
00:35:20,065 --> 00:35:23,545
laughs at anything i say right right

993
00:35:23,785 --> 00:35:25,554
yeah it's true right i feel like

994
00:35:25,555 --> 00:35:26,605
anytime i've done something like that i

995
00:35:26,605 --> 00:35:28,195
have like an out-of-body experience like i

996
00:35:28,195 --> 00:35:30,145
feel like i'm not like so weird

997
00:35:30,475 --> 00:35:32,425
yeah i've i've done such a bad

998
00:35:32,425 --> 00:35:34,945
job anytime i've done panel on a

999
00:35:34,945 --> 00:35:36,895
talk show i hate doing panel

1000
00:35:36,895 --> 00:35:38,575
yeah it's the worst beason because you

1001
00:35:38,575 --> 00:35:40,345
just feel like no they don't they

1002
00:35:40,345 --> 00:35:42,055
don't know who i am they're they're

1003
00:35:42,055 --> 00:35:43,945
like bummed out it's not a cooler

1004
00:35:43,945 --> 00:35:45,834
guest oh see for me i feel

1005
00:35:45,834 --> 00:35:47,515
like my feeling is i not a

1006
00:35:47,515 --> 00:35:49,435
standup so when i do these things

1007
00:35:49,435 --> 00:35:51,475
i'm like i don't like having a

1008
00:35:51,475 --> 00:35:54,175
pre-written joke i say i don't like

1009
00:35:54,175 --> 00:35:56,335
them interface pri right then i feel

1010
00:35:56,335 --> 00:35:57,055
like i get

1011
00:35:57,115 --> 00:35:59,305
so steamrolled by the people who did

1012
00:35:59,305 --> 00:36:01,045
pre-run so then it's like it's just

1013
00:36:01,045 --> 00:36:02,785
not me not my favorite way to

1014
00:36:02,845 --> 00:36:04,555
be funny the only thing that i

1015
00:36:04,555 --> 00:36:05,935
ever liked that happened was on that

1016
00:36:05,935 --> 00:36:08,545
seth meyers i had gone through three

1017
00:36:08,545 --> 00:36:09,895
pre interviews where i talked about my

1018
00:36:09,895 --> 00:36:10,915
stories and i was like i don't

1019
00:36:10,915 --> 00:36:12,385
even like these stories or whatever but

1020
00:36:12,385 --> 00:36:15,145
then when i got out there seth

1021
00:36:15,145 --> 00:36:17,066
was like so you host your the

1022
00:36:17,066 --> 00:36:17,215
whoa

1023
00:36:17,215 --> 00:36:18,355
most of your show and i said

1024
00:36:18,355 --> 00:36:20,935
yeah this is weird shouldn't we like

1025
00:36:20,965 --> 00:36:22,555

1026
00:36:22,555 --> 00:36:23,995
he's like right let's switch and then

1027
00:36:23,995 --> 00:36:25,435
like we switched so much more fun

1028
00:36:25,705 --> 00:36:27,205
it was so fun and he was

1029
00:36:27,205 --> 00:36:28,765
so into it and so so like

1030
00:36:28,765 --> 00:36:30,085
cool about it and everything it made

1031
00:36:30,115 --> 00:36:31,615
like it made the interview so much

1032
00:36:31,615 --> 00:36:33,595
more fun that we started on just

1033
00:36:33,595 --> 00:36:36,858

we've talked about this but i'm gonna

1069
00:37:55,315 --> 00:37:56,815
google this you may have come up

1070
00:37:56,815 --> 00:37:59,515
before y'all could just tell you um

1071
00:37:59,515 --> 00:38:01,135
well i mean that's part of trying

1072
00:38:01,137 --> 00:38:01,915
to make it so he doesn't have

1073
00:38:01,915 --> 00:38:03,475
to repeat himself well since it was

1074
00:38:03,475 --> 00:38:05,875
an adaptation of a british show that

1075
00:38:05,875 --> 00:38:07,465
already existed we were doing like the

1076
00:38:07,675 --> 00:38:08,335
their scripts

1077
00:38:08,455 --> 00:38:10,795
stuff i'm looking at you we had

1078
00:38:10,795 --> 00:38:12,475
to ah there were the guy who

1079
00:38:12,475 --> 00:38:14,455
is the producer of the show who

1080
00:38:14,455 --> 00:38:15,265
was the you know he was the

1081
00:38:15,265 --> 00:38:16,606
showrunner he was the director but he

1082
00:38:16,606 --> 00:38:20,245
was the showrunner he kept encouraging us

1083
00:38:20,395 --> 00:38:23,515
to do the exact line readings from

1084
00:38:23,515 --> 00:38:25,825
the original sketches and he would kind

1085
00:38:25,825 --> 00:38:27,865
of like try to direct you into

1086
00:38:27,865 --> 00:38:28,495
the end of that

1087
00:38:28,495 --> 00:38:30,775
it like force you into that and

1088
00:38:30,775 --> 00:38:32,485
it was frustrating because you know it

1089
00:38:32,485 --> 00:38:34,378
was me and and ah a couple

1090
00:38:34,378 --> 00:38:35,995
of few other americans marilyn rice called

1091
00:38:35,995 --> 00:38:39,295
kaitlin olson malcolm barrett um you know

1092
00:38:39,295 --> 00:38:41,155
we all auditioned in everything and at

1093
00:38:41,155 --> 00:38:42,325
the the additions were a lot of

1094
00:38:42,325 --> 00:38:44,605
fun and then when we finally got

1095
00:38:44,635 --> 00:38:46,135
there to do the show it was

1096
00:38:46,135 --> 00:38:48,655
sort of like we're just become

1097
00:38:48,655 --> 00:38:50,635
the parrots pop and it was really

1098
00:38:50,635 --> 00:38:52,885
frustrating and slicker you could have gotten

1099
00:38:52,885 --> 00:38:54,325
anybody to do this if this is

1100
00:38:54,325 --> 00:38:55,735
what you wanted right why did you

1101
00:38:55,735 --> 00:38:57,685
bother having why did you bother auditioning

1102
00:38:57,685 --> 00:39:01,675
comedy people so after a few weeks

1103
00:39:01,675 --> 00:39:04,945
of shooting i was getting so frustrated

1104
00:39:04,945 --> 00:39:06,595

campaign came out of a short film

1289
00:45:39,625 --> 00:45:40,495

1298
00:45:59,935 --> 00:46:00,805

1301
00:46:07,555 --> 00:46:10,105
a campaign during the last super bowl

1302
00:46:10,405 --> 00:46:12,415
that i think required you to remember

1303
00:46:12,475 --> 00:46:14,965

of this of us listing but both

1313
00:46:38,151 --> 00:46:40,225
cars are listing the budweiser campaigns you're

1314
00:46:40,225 --> 00:46:41,815
making a mockery of the woman who

1315
00:46:41,815 --> 00:46:44,005
said she goes she goes like where's

1316
00:46:44,005 --> 00:46:45,655

yeah that was one of it that

1322
00:46:58,465 --> 00:47:00,325
was one of his big breaks what

1323
00:47:00,325 --> 00:47:01,765
did he do that's why i hired

1324
00:47:01,765 --> 00:47:04,225
him on comedy baby you're like i

1325
00:47:04,225 --> 00:47:06,985

think you'd be really good and my

1327
00:47:08,215 --> 00:47:11,245
shoe i remember was something about someone

1328
00:47:11,245 --> 00:47:12,145
getting hit in the head with a

1329
00:47:12,145 --> 00:47:12,325
cat

1330
00:47:12,325 --> 00:47:15,085
can that's all i recall sounds hilarious

1331
00:47:15,115 --> 00:47:16,915
he was very deadpan as i recall

1332
00:47:16,915 --> 00:47:17,995
it so i don't laugh at things

1333
00:47:17,995 --> 00:47:19,765
like that i don't like it when

1334
00:47:19,765 --> 00:47:21,445
people are injured i would love it

1335
00:47:21,445 --> 00:47:22,615
if something fell on your head right

1336
00:47:22,615 --> 00:47:25,151
now but it would be funny yeah

1337
00:47:25,225 --> 00:47:26,995
you should have like a trap like

1338
00:47:26,995 --> 00:47:28,825
a fake book or something hanging above

1339
00:47:28,825 --> 00:47:31,015
your plate i book you can just

1340
00:47:31,165 --> 00:47:32,485
slap on the slime

1341
00:47:32,515 --> 00:47:34,308
to myself all these like oh look

1342
00:47:34,326 --> 00:47:36,445
so fucking cool hanging but then you

1343
00:47:36,505 --> 00:47:38,275
do like reverse so you like push

1344
00:47:38,275 --> 00:47:39,565
up into it and then you expect

1345
00:47:39,565 --> 00:47:42,295
everyone to think it just felt oh

1346
00:47:42,775 --> 00:47:44,365
you tilt the camera and you're like

1347
00:47:44,485 --> 00:47:48,025
oh ah

00:47:54,835 --> 00:47:57,595

1349
00:47:57,655 --> 00:47:58,795
if i was doing that have you

1350
00:47:58,855 --> 00:47:59,215
decent

1351
00:48:00,475 --> 00:48:02,035

that's right oh my heavens i almost

1357
00:48:15,835 --> 00:48:17,005
forgot we were having so much fun

1358
00:48:17,065 --> 00:48:18,925
oh my heavens and now that fun

1359
00:48:18,925 --> 00:48:21,475
stops this is a a game called

1360
00:48:21,535 --> 00:48:25,285
increasingly verbose and in is submitted by

1361
00:48:25,345 --> 00:48:27,835
prize check p r i s e

1362
00:48:27,835 --> 00:48:29,635
c h e c k maybe play

1363
00:48:29,635 --> 00:48:30,325
on price check

1364
00:48:30,715 --> 00:48:32,275
oh the object of the game is

1365
00:48:32,275 --> 00:48:34,555
to complicate a simple sentence until the

1366
00:48:34,555 --> 00:48:37,945
sentence can be complicated no further player

1367
00:48:37,945 --> 00:48:40,645
one provides the simple sentence players two

1368
00:48:40,645 --> 00:48:42,715
and three will then take turns complicating

1369
00:48:42,715 --> 00:48:45,535
the sentence slightly so here's an example

1370
00:48:46,135 --> 00:48:48,355
do you like jazz is the sample

1371
00:48:48,355 --> 00:48:50,485
quit is the sample question then

1372
00:48:50,485 --> 00:48:52,225
if somebody has to say has to

1373
00:48:52,255 --> 00:48:53,845
enhance it like say do you particularly

1374
00:48:53,845 --> 00:48:55,705
enjoy jazz music and then the next

1375
00:48:55,705 --> 00:48:57,385
person has to maybe say i would

1376
00:48:57,385 --> 00:48:59,065
like to inquire about your opinion of

1377
00:48:59,065 --> 00:49:00,415
the improvised form of music known as

1378
00:49:00,415 --> 00:49:02,455
jazz and so on and so on

1379
00:49:03,685 --> 00:49:04,885
great and then i guess the the

1380
00:49:04,885 --> 00:49:07,465
winner is whoever can keep going the

1381
00:49:07,465 --> 00:49:08,965
launch there's no winner and we just

1382
00:49:08,965 --> 00:49:10,855
have fun no there has to be

1383
00:49:10,885 --> 00:49:12,775
more has to be a winner and

1384
00:49:12,775 --> 00:49:14,035
and yeah i think it's a person

1385
00:49:14,035 --> 00:49:14,845
and it has to be made a

1386
00:49:14,845 --> 00:49:17,245
longest and it's oh i was once

1387
00:49:17,245 --> 00:49:18,595
playing a card game with my niece

1388
00:49:18,985 --> 00:49:20,335
i think we were just playing war

1389
00:49:20,665 --> 00:49:23,305
and i accidentally won i was out

1390
00:49:23,314 --> 00:49:23,815
trying to

1391
00:49:24,055 --> 00:49:25,915
and then she said let's let's play

1392
00:49:25,915 --> 00:49:27,715
again but this time make it so

1393
00:49:27,715 --> 00:49:31,885
i win oh and i didn't woe

1394
00:49:32,365 --> 00:49:33,475
to provide a good lesson

1395
00:49:34,795 --> 00:49:36,595
okay we really like starts i ll

1396
00:49:36,595 --> 00:49:38,575
be happy to dispense the simple oak

1397
00:49:38,575 --> 00:49:40,825
sentence and will go clockwise on the

1398
00:49:40,825 --> 00:49:43,526
zoom meaning lower than me see and

1399
00:49:43,526 --> 00:49:46,075
that's me that's counter-clockwise we have learned

1400
00:49:47,185 --> 00:49:48,565
we should have dragged ourselves into the

1401
00:49:48,565 --> 00:49:51,265
same position which way okay so who

1402
00:49:51,355 --> 00:49:54,025
who so lauren drag yourself into the

1403
00:49:54,025 --> 00:49:57,025
position where your clockwise from paul i

1404
00:49:57,025 --> 00:50:00,025
mean i'll just go after paul no

1405
00:50:00,565 --> 00:50:03,085
no you will drag yourself young lady

1406
00:50:05,515 --> 00:50:06,595
um okay

1407
00:50:08,215 --> 00:50:10,705
okay here we go i think it's

1408
00:50:10,705 --> 00:50:11,155
raining

1409
00:50:12,865 --> 00:50:15,805
i believe the sky has some precipitation

1410
00:50:18,385 --> 00:50:21,505
i in fact do believe

1411
00:50:22,795 --> 00:50:25,105
that the sky above us has an

1412
00:50:25,105 --> 00:50:26,905
unusual amount of precipitation

1413
00:50:30,625 --> 00:50:31,945
laura that's me oh i thought was

1414
00:50:31,945 --> 00:50:32,395
you paul

1415
00:50:32,995 --> 00:50:35,095
no i mean you never get to

1416
00:50:35,095 --> 00:50:36,625
go i think it goes between two

1417
00:50:36,625 --> 00:50:39,505
people alright i'm alright um i mean

1418
00:50:39,505 --> 00:50:40,405
i get to go if you guys

1419
00:50:40,405 --> 00:50:41,455
are going to be dicks about it

1420
00:50:41,845 --> 00:50:44,305
in my estimation i want upside dry

1421
00:50:44,305 --> 00:50:46,165
and now i'm odu covered in wet

1422
00:50:46,225 --> 00:50:47,785
due to the fact that the rain

1423
00:50:47,785 --> 00:50:49,705
is coming down from the sky precipitating

1424
00:50:49,705 --> 00:50:51,445
from the class just changing the entire

1425
00:50:51,445 --> 00:50:51,985
sentence

1426
00:50:53,790 --> 00:50:54,890
it was a game like we don't

1427
00:50:54,890 --> 00:50:57,230
have to say the story to be

1428
00:50:57,230 --> 00:50:59,900
a stickler for severe sentence the first

1429
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:01,220
engine was i think it's raining

1430
00:51:02,420 --> 00:51:03,440
but i feel like we need to

1431
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:05,060
build on what the previous person does

1432
00:51:05,060 --> 00:51:07,280
we should rather than well that that

1433
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:08,900
was specified but i do think that

1434
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:12,860
you have to retain the original words

1435
00:51:13,550 --> 00:51:17,480
i'm not look look i'll shoot again

1436
00:51:17,540 --> 00:51:19,730
we're not price check here let's try

1437
00:51:19,730 --> 00:51:22,130
to get maybe price check should have

1438
00:51:22,130 --> 00:51:22,550
said why

1439
00:51:22,550 --> 00:51:25,250
but his intention his or hers intention

1440
00:51:25,910 --> 00:51:29,660
let's troll yes i think the idea

1441
00:51:29,660 --> 00:51:31,910
is that you want to ah still

1442
00:51:31,910 --> 00:51:33,710
keep the words in the original sentence

1443
00:51:33,770 --> 00:51:35,690
the yeah although there was in the

1444
00:51:35,690 --> 00:51:37,610
example the latin the most elaborate one

1445
00:51:37,610 --> 00:51:38,870
did not have some of the original

1446
00:51:38,870 --> 00:51:41,585
words it didn't yeah so i think

1447
00:51:41,631 --> 00:51:42,710
it didn't build upon the pre

1448
00:51:42,710 --> 00:51:45,260
obvious one though yes it did i

1449
00:51:45,290 --> 00:51:47,450
think you you want to retain the

1450
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:50,420
central idea okay you know you're you're

1451
00:51:50,420 --> 00:51:52,310
trying to communicate the same thing with

1452
00:51:52,310 --> 00:51:55,070
as many words as possible okay okay

1453
00:51:55,580 --> 00:51:57,350
we'll try it again you want a

1454
00:51:57,350 --> 00:51:59,540
new sentence yeah i want a nuisance

1455
00:52:02,030 --> 00:52:03,860
i woke up too late

1456
00:52:09,636 --> 00:52:13,100
you see lauren you my myself

1457
00:52:14,390 --> 00:52:16,820
um oh well some sources i'm i'm

1458
00:52:16,850 --> 00:52:17,930
i'm supposed to to keep in i

1459
00:52:17,930 --> 00:52:18,890
woke up too late as part of

1460
00:52:18,890 --> 00:52:20,270
the sentence no i guess you're just

1461
00:52:20,270 --> 00:52:21,980
supposed to like cheney cheney and a

1462
00:52:21,980 --> 00:52:23,690
little more word keep this keep the

1463
00:52:23,690 --> 00:52:26,330
sentence structure yeah ok again start small

1464
00:52:26,330 --> 00:52:27,740
so we can build okay

1465
00:52:29,270 --> 00:52:31,490
um i

1466
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:33,500

1467
00:52:35,390 --> 00:52:37,310
i my scared um

1468
00:52:39,170 --> 00:52:43,280
i i woke up later than i

1469
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:43,970
intended

1470
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:48,560
i found out that i had awakened

1471
00:52:48,710 --> 00:52:50,630
much later than i had attended

1472
00:52:51,860 --> 00:52:53,210
i found out that i had awakened

1473
00:52:53,210 --> 00:52:55,460
much later than i had intended due

1474
00:52:55,460 --> 00:52:56,690
to my alarm clock not

1475
00:52:58,130 --> 00:52:58,730
alarming

1476
00:53:00,110 --> 00:53:02,780
i found out upon reflection that i

1477
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:04,640
had awakened much later than i had

1478
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:08,720
intended mainly due to my alarm clock

1479
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:10,700
not being set and not alarming

1480
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:14,360
i found out that i had awakened

1481
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:16,340
much later than i had intended due

1482
00:53:16,340 --> 00:53:17,660
to the fact that my alarm clock

1483
00:53:17,660 --> 00:53:20,060
was not set nor did it alarm

1484
00:53:20,450 --> 00:53:22,700
causing me great distress as i wrote

1485
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:24,500
arrived late what i was supposed to

1486
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:27,980
be there for i found out much

1487
00:53:27,980 --> 00:53:30,440
later much to my chagrin that i

1488
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:31,910
had awakened much mm

1489
00:53:31,910 --> 00:53:34,670
much too late much later than i

1490
00:53:34,670 --> 00:53:37,370
had intended in fact mainly due to

1491
00:53:37,370 --> 00:53:38,570
the fact that i had not set

1492
00:53:38,570 --> 00:53:40,460
my alarm and it had not alarmed

1493
00:53:40,490 --> 00:53:42,470
and i didn't wind up at the

1494
00:53:42,470 --> 00:53:43,760
place i forget what you said is

1495
00:53:44,810 --> 00:53:46,910
the place where i had intended to

1496
00:53:46,910 --> 00:53:48,890
go and it fucking sucked

1497
00:53:50,570 --> 00:53:52,250
well once you leave my piece of

1498
00:53:52,250 --> 00:53:54,740
shit luck i woke up later than

1499
00:53:54,740 --> 00:53:55,880
in china due to the fact that

1500
00:53:55,880 --> 00:53:57,350
my alarm clock was not set nor

1501
00:53:57,350 --> 00:54:00,410
did it alarm because i did not

1502
00:54:00,410 --> 00:54:03,500
set it and so i was getting

1503
00:54:06,020 --> 00:54:07,430
i think we're gonna stop there because

1504
00:54:07,430 --> 00:54:09,320
scott did include the the phrase i

1505
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:12,080
forgot what you said yeah so i

1506
00:54:12,110 --> 00:54:13,850
think that's a good indication that it's

1507
00:54:13,850 --> 00:54:15,440
time to move on let's try let's

1508
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:16,670
try it again i'm gonna maybe a

1509
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:19,010
sentence or do you wanna move on

1510
00:54:19,010 --> 00:54:20,840
to a different game no no no

1511
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:22,130
i'm let's do this together yeah yeah

1512
00:54:22,220 --> 00:54:24,560

00:54:25,460 --> 00:54:27,260
my cows it sorry i'm i also

1514
00:54:27,260 --> 00:54:29,090
think you're not supposed to necessarily add

1515
00:54:29,090 --> 00:54:31,430
onto the story i think you just

1516
00:54:31,430 --> 00:54:34,010
need to express the same phrase right

1517
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:36,710
with as many words as possible okay

1518
00:54:36,740 --> 00:54:37,910
my car won't start

1519
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:42,170
me yeah good

1520
00:54:44,990 --> 00:54:47,000

00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,860
day won't start

1522
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:53,510
unfortunately i found out my car when

00:54:53,510 --> 00:54:55,250
i drive every day won't start

1524
00:54:57,830 --> 00:55:02,150
my car automobile if you will seems

1525
00:55:02,150 --> 00:55:04,010
to be under the impression that it

1526
00:55:04,010 --> 00:55:06,110
is not supposed to start today

1527
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:11,870
unfortunately this little thing over here that

1528
00:55:11,870 --> 00:55:13,940
i like to call a car you

1529
00:55:13,940 --> 00:55:15,620
know the one i drive every day

1530
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:18,590
you get it it's under the impression

1531
00:55:18,590 --> 00:55:21,560
that it is maybe not supposed to

1532
00:55:21,590 --> 00:55:24,680
turn the engine over today aka starts

1533
00:55:26,750 --> 00:55:29,960
i firmly believe that of all the

1534
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:33,710
misfortunes that could befall a poor benighted

1535
00:55:33,710 --> 00:55:37,820
souls such as myself falling downstairs eating

1536
00:55:37,820 --> 00:55:39,230
an apple with a worm in it

1537
00:55:39,710 --> 00:55:41,780
ah the rain on my wedding day

1538
00:55:42,140 --> 00:55:45,500
sure the absolute worst the unspeakable if

1539
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:46,070
you will

1540
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:47,810
has just occurred today

1541
00:55:48,950 --> 00:55:49,820
my car won't start

1542
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:55,310
we the american people understand one thing

1543
00:55:55,310 --> 00:55:59,570
about ourselves we like to wake up

1544
00:55:59,570 --> 00:56:01,280
every morning work hard

1545
00:56:02,420 --> 00:56:04,790
put our children through school hope that

1546
00:56:04,790 --> 00:56:06,620
they better us in some way when

1547
00:56:06,620 --> 00:56:09,170
they grow up and unfortunately that's not

1548
00:56:09,170 --> 00:56:11,450
going to happen to me because i

1549
00:56:11,450 --> 00:56:14,060
cannot arrive at my place of employment

1550
00:56:14,060 --> 00:56:17,270
today because my car well it won't

1551
00:56:17,270 --> 00:56:17,660
start

1552
00:56:19,940 --> 00:56:22,070
these are the times that try men's

1553
00:56:22,100 --> 00:56:22,640
souls

1554
00:56:24,290 --> 00:56:28,190
when wishing to leave one's home too

1555
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:34,340
fly free explore strange new worlds seek

1556
00:56:34,340 --> 00:56:36,560
out new life and new civilizations to

1557
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:38,450
boldly go and no one has gone

1558
00:56:38,450 --> 00:56:41,060
before why that requires some form of

1559
00:56:41,060 --> 00:56:43,760
conveyance and the formic fans i have

1560
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:47,300
a car well it done did me

1561
00:56:47,330 --> 00:56:49,430
dirty this morning by

1562
00:56:49,430 --> 00:56:51,920
by not doing what it is supposed

1563
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:54,530
to do i e starting but in

1564
00:56:54,530 --> 00:56:57,890
fact doing the exact opposite of what

1565
00:56:57,890 --> 00:56:59,900
i desired it to do which was

1566
00:57:00,350 --> 00:57:01,700
to not start

1567
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:05,000
i think paul wins if you want

1568
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,200
to try to go longer

1569
00:57:07,250 --> 00:57:09,890
alright that was long that was long

1570
00:57:10,280 --> 00:57:12,110
i was long that was long i

1571
00:57:12,110 --> 00:57:14,360
was small and more yes give all

1572
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:14,960
the intense

1573
00:57:16,880 --> 00:57:17,990
i read a book today

1574
00:57:22,130 --> 00:57:24,020
i read the pages of a printed

1575
00:57:24,020 --> 00:57:24,740
book today

1576
00:57:28,310 --> 00:57:32,390
in my thirst for knowledge i will

1577
00:57:32,390 --> 00:57:32,780
admit

1578
00:57:33,860 --> 00:57:35,900
i opened up a book and read

1579
00:57:35,900 --> 00:57:39,860
it just today in my never-ending quest

1580
00:57:39,860 --> 00:57:41,930
to know more about the world around

1581
00:57:41,930 --> 00:57:43,760
me and those who have come before

1582
00:57:44,270 --> 00:57:46,400
i opened up the creased pages of

1583
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:49,130
a printed book today and read the

1584
00:57:49,130 --> 00:57:50,750
words written thusly

1585
00:57:52,910 --> 00:57:54,590
you know my mother always used to

1586
00:57:54,590 --> 00:57:55,970
say that i was born with the

1587
00:57:55,970 --> 00:57:59,420
curiosity of a thousand cats and i

1588
00:57:59,420 --> 00:58:01,850
think this tale will bear her out

1589
00:58:02,450 --> 00:58:05,450
just today i saw a book and

1590
00:58:05,450 --> 00:58:07,850
said i gotta know what's inside that

1591
00:58:07,880 --> 00:58:09,320
son of a bitch and so i

1592
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:11,690
opened it and page by page i

1593
00:58:11,690 --> 00:58:11,990
can see

1594
00:58:11,993 --> 00:58:15,950
assume the information within until finally there

1595
00:58:15,950 --> 00:58:18,020
were no more pages that was just

1596
00:58:18,020 --> 00:58:18,290
today

1597
00:58:19,940 --> 00:58:21,560
i started the day having read no

1598
00:58:21,560 --> 00:58:25,790
books and already the day i would

1599
00:58:25,790 --> 00:58:27,620
like to have read a book so

1600
00:58:27,620 --> 00:58:29,210
for that being said i

1601
00:58:30,380 --> 00:58:34,160
are you on the bachelor that ah

1602
00:58:34,490 --> 00:58:36,710
i pulled a book from the shelves

1603
00:58:36,740 --> 00:58:39,260
of my home and i opened the

1604
00:58:39,260 --> 00:58:42,440
book and read each word until it

1605
00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:46,550
formed sentences and paragraphs paragraphs into chapters

1606
00:58:46,550 --> 00:58:49,850
chapters into a full story which i

1607
00:58:49,850 --> 00:58:50,240
then

1608
00:58:50,420 --> 00:58:53,000
heartily consumed and now have the knowledge

1609
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:54,080
of within my brain

1610
00:58:58,190 --> 00:58:59,780
to thine own self be true a

1611
00:58:59,780 --> 00:59:03,230
wise man once said and i agree

1612
00:59:03,230 --> 00:59:05,570
with that wise man because if i

1613
00:59:05,570 --> 00:59:09,350
can admit anything about myself it's that

1614
00:59:10,040 --> 00:59:13,670
i like to read books and coincidentally

1615
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:14,990
just today

1616
00:59:16,040 --> 00:59:20,090
i read and i don't want i

1617
00:59:20,120 --> 00:59:22,880
don't want to stress this too heavily

1618
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:26,660
but this happened within the confines of

1619
00:59:26,660 --> 00:59:27,980
a twenty four hour period

1620
00:59:29,390 --> 00:59:30,410
close parentheses

1621
00:59:31,820 --> 00:59:32,510
i read a book

1622
00:59:35,540 --> 00:59:36,590
this is going to be tough lauren

1623
00:59:36,590 --> 00:59:38,240
can you do if and when we

1624
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:40,430
saw somebody justin bieber beat paul of

1625
00:59:40,430 --> 00:59:41,420
this game because this is how he

1626
00:59:41,420 --> 00:59:41,990
does stand up

1627
00:59:43,610 --> 00:59:45,530
i once saw a poster that read

1628
00:59:45,560 --> 00:59:49,610
reading is fundamental and the de mental

1629
00:59:49,610 --> 00:59:51,470
part was crossed out leaving just the

1630
00:59:51,470 --> 00:59:51,710
word

1631
00:59:52,790 --> 00:59:56,660
haha next story knowing that

1632
01:00:00,031 --> 01:00:01,010
i just say it

1633
01:00:02,570 --> 01:00:05,120
try it for myself i

1634
01:00:07,190 --> 01:00:09,470
took what is known as a book

1635
01:00:10,010 --> 01:00:11,210
teaches you

1636
01:00:12,470 --> 01:00:16,310
this page has been together by thread

1637
01:00:16,730 --> 01:00:20,330
on the spine glued into a hardcover

1638
01:00:20,810 --> 01:00:23,570
and printed with the title on the

1639
01:00:23,570 --> 01:00:25,310
front so all who see it must

1640
01:00:25,310 --> 01:00:26,390
know what is inside

1641
01:00:29,150 --> 01:00:32,090
i opened page one and began to

1642
01:00:32,090 --> 01:00:34,070
read and my eyes could not stop

1643
01:00:34,070 --> 01:00:35,330
going from left to right

1644
01:00:37,670 --> 01:00:40,250
the words written by this man who

1645
01:00:40,250 --> 01:00:42,200
came before me right

1646
01:00:44,660 --> 01:00:48,500
right this piece of fine literature and

1647
01:00:48,770 --> 01:00:50,750
as i closed it at the very

1648
01:00:50,750 --> 01:00:53,240
end i thought i have simply read

1649
01:00:53,240 --> 01:00:53,510
