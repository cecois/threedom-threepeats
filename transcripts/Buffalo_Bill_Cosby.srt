culture thing that a lot of people

500
00:18:00,655 --> 00:18:03,055
and then i just stop watching it

502
00:18:04,945 --> 00:18:06,655

jeff and all that yeah so when

505
00:18:11,875 --> 00:18:13,675
life in hell and so when i

506
00:18:13,675 --> 00:18:15,055
heard he was making a tv shows

507
00:18:15,055 --> 00:18:16,525
like what and then it was you

508
00:18:16,525 --> 00:18:18,355
know with all these like comedians that

509
00:18:18,355 --> 00:18:19,975
i really liked and and writers and

510
00:18:19,975 --> 00:18:23,065
stuff so it was like it really

511
00:18:23,065 --> 00:18:24,145
shaped a lot of my sense of

512
00:18:24,145 --> 00:18:27,625
humor up until up until i remember

513
00:18:27,625 --> 00:18:29,395
like the episode that was terrible or

514
00:18:29,395 --> 00:18:29,815
i was like

515
00:18:30,115 --> 00:18:31,795
ohne oh my god simpsons made a

516
00:18:31,795 --> 00:18:33,475
bad episode i couldn't believe it it

517
00:18:33,475 --> 00:18:35,425
was like the x-files episode and then

518
00:18:35,425 --> 00:18:37,375
it took such like a downhill turn

519
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:39,025
for me tour i can't watch it

520
00:18:39,025 --> 00:18:40,765
ever again here's what i think is

521
00:18:40,765 --> 00:18:42,355
a big difference for me is that

522
00:18:42,925 --> 00:18:46,495
i watched in in it's original airings

523
00:18:46,765 --> 00:18:48,475
and i didn't watch in syndication because

524
00:18:48,475 --> 00:18:49,885
of how old i am yeah

525
00:18:50,095 --> 00:18:52,045
i it was just a tv show

526
00:18:52,045 --> 00:18:53,065
to me and it was like i

527
00:18:53,065 --> 00:18:54,565
understand you have a different relationship to

528
00:18:54,565 --> 00:18:56,695
shows that are on like after school

529
00:18:57,055 --> 00:18:58,585
shows that you can watch over and

530
00:18:58,585 --> 00:19:00,235
over and over again because it's always

531
00:19:00,235 --> 00:19:02,245
on and for me it was not

532
00:19:02,245 --> 00:19:03,955
that way so it was like appointment

533
00:19:03,955 --> 00:19:05,425
television that i would watch sure it

534
00:19:05,425 --> 00:19:08,155
came on yes but now it's like

535
00:19:08,155 --> 00:19:10,225
people people reference

536
00:19:10,255 --> 00:19:13,375
the simpsons all the time sampson and

537
00:19:13,645 --> 00:19:16,285
it it it sort of ruined the

538
00:19:16,285 --> 00:19:17,545
simpsons for me you know what i

539
00:19:17,577 --> 00:19:19,578
mean like i'm just sick of seeing

540
00:19:19,855 --> 00:19:21,925

foss

545
00:19:30,385 --> 00:19:31,705
our brooks fans ruined him for me

to not do anything and have someone

652
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:33,680

when i was working on mister show

in the bank and then

679
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,390
never look at the balance and then

680
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:28,730
just withdraw anytime i wanted money and

681
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:29,930

682
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:32,150
my last check i put it in

683
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:35,240

00:24:43,009 --> 00:24:44,960
my balancing and i was overdrawn was

688
00:24:44,977 --> 00:24:46,640

exact amount out

692
00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:55,760

696
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:06,200
don't believe technically there's no law that

697
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:09,200
says yeah hey tax evasion is way

698
00:25:09,230 --> 00:25:11,780
um because i had i always have

699
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:15,740
like menial jobs and no one noticed

700
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:17,450
like i also i also did not

701
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:18,650
know how to do stuff you know

702
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:19,550
any mean i think a lot of

703
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:21,740
people just don't know what's going yeah

704
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:22,610
yeah there's no one like

705
00:25:22,610 --> 00:25:24,230
gg says you have to do it

706
00:25:24,656 --> 00:25:26,330
you just start to figure out that

707
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:27,500
you're supposed to be doing it yeah

708
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:29,060
it's a thing you hear other people

709
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:30,800
talk about yeah and then after a

710
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:33,560
while the government says now we need

711
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:36,740
to talk yeah but i and i

712
00:25:36,927 --> 00:25:38,330
so it took me a little bit

713
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:40,460
to get it all straightened out and

714
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:42,290
then now i'm good with all that

715
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:42,770
stuff but

716
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:44,540
all the all the sort of like

717
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:45,920
what you would think of is like

718
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:48,290
sort of homesick kind of yeah life

know even just said away it was

805
00:28:39,530 --> 00:28:41,090

807
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:46,820
c fields shtick know well w c

808
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:48,650
field to think just was a drunken

809
00:28:48,650 --> 00:28:50,300
real life but it but in the

810
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:51,650
movies i thought he played it up

811
00:28:51,650 --> 00:28:52,970
though i don't

812
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:58,160
recall that di martin was just like

813
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:00,230
i drink a lot you know and

814
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:02,810
but it wasn't a pronounced like slurring

815
00:29:02,810 --> 00:29:05,690
drunk guy he's like comedians like that

816
00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:07,760
now besides like chelsea handler

817
00:29:11,001 --> 00:29:12,650
like drinking is their thumb yeah i

818
00:29:12,650 --> 00:29:14,579
don't yeah like doug stanhope i mean

819
00:29:14,579 --> 00:29:16,400
there's ron white you know there's guys

820
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:18,470
like have alcohol on stage but i

821
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:20,330
think and you did the you did

822
00:29:20,330 --> 00:29:22,100
the euro oh yeah i did it

823
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,050
i hope you did what i did

824
00:29:24,050 --> 00:29:26,900
a whole special on hbo thing like

825
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:28,580
a one man show where i drink

826
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:28,820
for

827
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,220
i drink four pints of guinness over

828
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:32,240
the course of a half i don't

829
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:36,380
think i know about this my in-laws

830
00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:38,240
saw that before janey and i met

831
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:41,270
oh wow just by yeah but yeah

832
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:43,400
obviously and then when she showed you

833
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,570
know when we were dating she showed

834
00:29:44,570 --> 00:29:45,560
them a picture of me and they're

835
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:47,030
like oh that guy from the special

836
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:49,940
and so what happened by this question

837
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:52,520
in the special i just talk and

838
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:54,050
then you get more drunk it's set

839
00:29:54,050 --> 00:29:56,180
in a bar no i don't you

840
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:58,100
would be hard pressed to see that

841
00:29:58,100 --> 00:29:59,180
it had any effect on me at

842
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:00,650
all and then so what was the

843
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:03,980
reason ah it was like rocky hunt

844
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:07,220
and i also felt like you know

845
00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:08,210
drinking was part of

846
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,310
my personality at that time you know

847
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:12,620
what i mean which is kind of

848
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:14,030
embarrassing when i think about it now

849
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,980
drinking and i guess yeah poking a

850
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,720
similar part of your personality in a

851
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:20,060
way i didn't talk much about smoking

852
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:22,010
but i definitely smoked a lot and

853
00:30:22,010 --> 00:30:24,350

854
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:27,830
smoking was a thing where

855
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:31,580
a big thing that helped me quit

877
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:15,650

one

886
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,000
of the things about smoking is that

887
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,680
it makes you think that as part

888
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:42,080
of your personality and i remember my

889
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:45,710
therapist saying ah you know because i

890
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:47,510

891
00:31:47,510 --> 00:31:48,860
said well it's like you know when

892
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:51,110
you quit smoking you know one of

893
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:53,150
the things you think is ah that

894
00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:54,800
makes it seem impossible to quit as

895
00:31:55,550 --> 00:31:56,840
who would i be

896
00:31:57,470 --> 00:31:59,270
if this is no longer a part

897
00:31:59,270 --> 00:32:00,980
of my personality because you don't know

898
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:02,810
you can envision it and you really

899
00:32:02,810 --> 00:32:04,760
can't like when yeah when you're smoking

900
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:06,830

eat so good but i thought i'd

925
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:57,320
retweet

926
00:32:57,461 --> 00:32:59,720
and then the responses on it started

927
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,580
to be like people defending vaping and

928
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:03,440
how like it's actually so much better

929
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,360
than smoking and better it doesn't mean

930
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,340
it's good i don't give you what

931
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:09,860
yeah exactly about like it's yeah why

932
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:11,330
are you saying like okay it's better

933
00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:12,890
than smoking like yeah you're not walking

934
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:16,100
around smoking two-pack sos chewing tobacco like

935
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,480
it's still grows and

936
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:19,190
it still does cause effects that we

937
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:20,690
don't even know you know a thing

938
00:33:20,690 --> 00:33:21,800
that i then wait there's another thing

939
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,990
where because people were having like people

940
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:26,210
kid during the hospital for vaping like

941
00:33:26,270 --> 00:33:28,010
accidents or like things that happen really

942
00:33:28,010 --> 00:33:29,660
quickly to their bodies and then people

943
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:31,940
go actually they were buying like illegal

944
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:33,500
versions of things that were like like

945
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:35,870
not the the sanctioned brands or whatever

946
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:37,250
and so that's where that haven't actually

947
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:37,628
do your

948
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,830
research it's like talking about it like

949
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:40,730
it's medicine

950
00:33:42,273 --> 00:33:46,280
this i hate it i remember in

951
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:48,920
ah doug benson's movie he did that

952
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:52,850
documentary super high me where he smoked

953
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:56,232
he got high for thirty days and

954
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,980
was there like all day every day

955
00:33:58,010 --> 00:33:59,270
yeah i think he would wake up

956
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:01,070
and yeah you and that probably was

957
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:02,120
what he was doing already

958
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:04,160
yeah i don't know and then he

959
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:06,140
was so sometimes she's always stoned though

960
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:08,750
that's like the point not only okay

961
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:09,890
i think it's eighty i see him

962
00:34:09,890 --> 00:34:11,660
in the context of auto companies yes

963
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:13,040
just yes yeah but he there was

964
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,390
a he had sort of like a

965
00:34:14,390 --> 00:34:16,670
panel review at the end of the

966
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:19,460
the whole thing and there was a

967
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:20,963
doctor there you know and they were

968
00:34:20,963 --> 00:34:22,250
just like talking about

969
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:23,780
every all the experiences that he had

970
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:27,350
had you know and somebody asked the

971
00:34:27,350 --> 00:34:29,420

um is this is this safe and

975
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:42,080
the doctor said specifically about smoking while

976
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:42,440
i'm never

977
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:44,420
gonna tell anybody that they should inhale

978
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:45,830
anything to their lungs ever

979
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:48,860
there's other there's other ways to get

980
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:50,300
it and if you get it other

981
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:53,690
ways it can be perfectly safe and

982
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:55,910
have benefits right and that's but that's

983
00:34:55,910 --> 00:34:57,680

september you shut up

1075
00:38:17,570 --> 00:38:18,920
we when we do these shows a

1076
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:20,690
lot of times it's that ah we

1077
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,790
it's a sort of in-between time where

1078
00:38:22,790 --> 00:38:24,500
we can't eat dinner before the show

1079
00:38:24,530 --> 00:38:27,170
as we land like late enough that

1080
00:38:27,170 --> 00:38:28,940
like yeah we landed we can only

1081
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:31,040
check into a hotel around three yeah

1082
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,630
we're doing quick turnarounds on this so

1083
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:35,000
we're always like landing somewhere around two

1084
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:36,620
getting into the hotel is three and

1085
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:38,030
then we have to like leave for

1086
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:39,680
the show at six thirty which only

1087
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:42,470
leaves like a weird portion of tongue

1088
00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:45,020
you're tired and shower any lunch you

1089
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:46,340
don't want to eat down yet yeah

1090
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,530
so we will want to eat after

1091
00:38:48,530 --> 00:38:50,840
the show for whatever reason it never

1092
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:53,120
occurred to us to research a place

1093
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:55,040
to eat before the show

1094
00:38:55,439 --> 00:38:56,810
so then after the show we ended

1095
00:38:56,810 --> 00:38:58,880
up looking walking around walking around while

1096
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,680

1100
00:39:06,770 --> 00:39:07,790

1101
00:39:07,850 --> 00:39:10,730
like there's no one there somebody sitting

1102
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:12,800
at a booth with that works there

1103
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,320

1139
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:24,920

shares from clipped just wide and big

1148
00:40:38,965 --> 00:40:41,095
bang but they didn't have oranges new

1149
00:40:41,095 --> 00:40:42,205
black which is like the only thing

1150
00:40:42,205 --> 00:40:44,545
anyone would i yeah no one wants

1151
00:40:44,545 --> 00:40:46,825
clipped right but it was one since

1152
00:40:46,825 --> 00:40:47,815
this is like a job for them

1153
00:40:47,815 --> 00:40:50,245
they don't it's yeah they're they're um

1154
00:40:50,605 --> 00:40:51,954
taking these home and going yeah i

1155
00:40:51,954 --> 00:40:53,785
got lauren lactose the signature they're going

1156
00:40:53,785 --> 00:40:55,555
in selling them but yeah do say

1157
00:40:55,585 --> 00:40:56,785
things that indicate

1158
00:40:57,145 --> 00:40:58,405
they know who you are and they

1159
00:40:58,405 --> 00:41:01,015
have watched your stuff they they they

1160
00:41:01,015 --> 00:41:02,545
do that intentionally they do a little

1161
00:41:02,545 --> 00:41:04,315
research so that it's so that the

1162
00:41:04,375 --> 00:41:06,295
people don't feel but i think it's

1163
00:41:06,295 --> 00:41:07,555
a little more than that because i

1164
00:41:07,555 --> 00:41:09,625
feel like this they have they've demonstrated

1165
00:41:09,625 --> 00:41:11,245
not not just like i am db

1166
00:41:11,245 --> 00:41:13,375
knowledge but you know they've actually was

1167
00:41:13,375 --> 00:41:16,435
like weirdly developing a show about autograph

1168
00:41:16,435 --> 00:41:16,945
hounds

1169
00:41:17,455 --> 00:41:19,135
really yeah and it's a it's a

1170
00:41:19,135 --> 00:41:21,985
crazy sub well like they i remember

1171
00:41:21,985 --> 00:41:23,065
the first time happened to me i

1172
00:41:23,065 --> 00:41:25,375
found it extremely creepy because they had

1173
00:41:25,495 --> 00:41:26,695
they knew when i was landing at

1174
00:41:26,695 --> 00:41:29,005
an airport yes civil yes and i

1175
00:41:29,005 --> 00:41:30,745
was like how the fuck would they

1176
00:41:30,745 --> 00:41:32,845
know yeah but it's really really weird

1177
00:41:32,845 --> 00:41:34,585
yeah and then they also want to

1178
00:41:34,585 --> 00:41:35,995
take photos with you which i don't

1179
00:41:36,025 --> 00:41:37,105
understand because if they

1180
00:41:37,375 --> 00:41:38,845
don't care about who you are why

1181
00:41:38,845 --> 00:41:40,165
do they want a picture with you

1182
00:41:40,585 --> 00:41:42,205
i don't really get with these sort

1183
00:41:42,205 --> 00:41:44,234
of collectors as well in a way

1184
00:41:44,245 --> 00:41:45,505
so they have like their collection of

1185
00:41:45,835 --> 00:41:47,425
all the people they've gotten and then

1186
00:41:47,425 --> 00:41:50,185
they sell the ones online who's buying

1187
00:41:50,185 --> 00:41:51,205
that but it could be that they

1188
00:41:51,205 --> 00:41:52,945
could also put the picture up there

1189
00:41:52,975 --> 00:41:55,135
to prove that here's me with this

1190
00:41:55,135 --> 00:41:57,265
pro and amateur yeah

1191
00:41:57,265 --> 00:41:59,485
yeah yeah that's probably right that's actually

1192
00:41:59,515 --> 00:42:01,645
probably right um anyway so those those

1193
00:42:01,645 --> 00:42:05,485
people also did not seem to grasp

1194
00:42:05,515 --> 00:42:07,105
how heavy the cookie cake well no

1195
00:42:07,105 --> 00:42:08,485
one could it was while he was

1196
00:42:08,485 --> 00:42:09,475
in a pizza but it looks like

1197
00:42:09,475 --> 00:42:11,155
we're carrying a piano but i said

1198
00:42:11,155 --> 00:42:13,225
to my couple even open i'll sign

1199
00:42:13,225 --> 00:42:15,115
these if you will hold this and

1200
00:42:15,115 --> 00:42:16,345
they were sort of like taking a

1201
00:42:16,345 --> 00:42:17,425
corner over i'm like no

1202
00:42:17,425 --> 00:42:19,045
no you have to hold and i'm

1203
00:42:19,045 --> 00:42:21,145
still holding it you have to hold

1204
00:42:21,145 --> 00:42:22,225
it so i can let go and

1205
00:42:22,225 --> 00:42:24,205
sign this and they would not do

1206
00:42:24,205 --> 00:42:26,845
it yeah so then we get through

1207
00:42:26,845 --> 00:42:29,485
that that i can't do it i

1208
00:42:29,485 --> 00:42:31,675

1209
00:42:31,735 --> 00:42:34,015
holding this i'm calling cookie cake and

1210
00:42:34,015 --> 00:42:35,365
then we go to someone directions kevin's

1212
00:42:37,465 --> 00:42:37,585

1213
00:42:37,615 --> 00:42:39,715

look at him we want good okay

1215
00:42:41,275 --> 00:42:42,535

00:42:54,685 --> 00:42:57,025
he goes oh so we're like what

1224
00:42:57,025 --> 00:42:57,745

1225
00:42:57,745 --> 00:42:59,155
tell bars that's probably good and i

1226
00:42:59,155 --> 00:43:01,160
was like what and he's like going

1227
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:01,975
to the hotel bar and i was

1228
00:43:01,975 --> 00:43:02,155
like

1229
00:43:03,689 --> 00:43:04,975
where are we going right are we

1230
00:43:04,975 --> 00:43:06,751
going to the hotel workflows go to

1231
00:43:06,751 --> 00:43:08,155
a different tellings like wyatt and we

1232
00:43:08,155 --> 00:43:09,775
had this really confused and had put

1233
00:43:09,775 --> 00:43:11,545
in the address of our hotel where

1234
00:43:11,545 --> 00:43:13,165
we're staying assuming we were going back

1235
00:43:13,165 --> 00:43:14,934
to the hotel but we will go

1236
00:43:14,934 --> 00:43:17,935
another hotel a totally wrong direction carrying

1237
00:43:17,935 --> 00:43:20,035
this big heavy cookie cake now in

1238
00:43:20,065 --> 00:43:22,765
kevin's defense we made these plans in

1239
00:43:22,795 --> 00:43:23,425
a taxi

1240
00:43:23,545 --> 00:43:24,865
that he was he didn't hear it

1241
00:43:25,375 --> 00:43:28,165
and we i we carelessly assumed he

1242
00:43:28,165 --> 00:43:29,125
would know what we were talking about

1243
00:43:29,125 --> 00:43:30,265
yeah and this is why we have

1244
00:43:30,265 --> 00:43:31,615
the group thread and this is why

1245
00:43:31,615 --> 00:43:32,925
we should put all information on the

1246
00:43:32,965 --> 00:43:35,395
raw information on the grill or information

1247
00:43:35,395 --> 00:43:37,165
from now on all information on the

1248
00:43:37,165 --> 00:43:38,785
group threat from now on every little

1249
00:43:38,785 --> 00:43:41,335
thought you had yeah every little plan

1250
00:43:41,335 --> 00:43:43,255
you make yeah every little step you

1251
00:43:43,255 --> 00:43:43,585

1252
00:43:43,585 --> 00:43:46,645
take a breath you wake you the

1253
00:43:46,675 --> 00:43:48,505

really waking barrett

1255
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:53,395
it puts it on the group threat

1256
00:43:53,455 --> 00:43:55,135
and puts it what else it gets

1257
00:43:55,135 --> 00:43:57,745
the hose so then it's so funny

1258
00:43:57,745 --> 00:44:01,075

00:44:55,885 --> 00:44:57,655
like i used to carry a huge

1288
00:44:57,655 --> 00:45:00,085
tray from bangalore yes yeah yeah coffee

1289
00:45:00,085 --> 00:45:01,945
cordoba were going to tell you you

1290
00:45:01,945 --> 00:45:03,475
do it on your fingertips like here's

1291
00:45:03,475 --> 00:45:04,855
why that didn't work what do you

1292
00:45:04,855 --> 00:45:05,935
think will be good

1293
00:45:06,895 --> 00:45:09,175
i'm fucking carried the entire way it's

1294
00:45:09,235 --> 00:45:12,115
putin see when we opened it and

1295
00:45:12,115 --> 00:45:13,738
how it had exploded from the center

1296
00:45:13,738 --> 00:45:15,295
it was all the fucking frosty you

1297
00:45:15,295 --> 00:45:16,375
know those probably from when i was

1298
00:45:16,375 --> 00:45:18,475
carrying it because the you had to

1299
00:45:18,805 --> 00:45:20,455
fit don't put that on hey who

1300
00:45:20,485 --> 00:45:21,858
cares we all want more cookie we

1301
00:45:21,865 --> 00:45:23,875
add up more frosting know honestly because

1302
00:45:23,875 --> 00:45:26,785
the the i could feel it

1303
00:45:26,785 --> 00:45:28,855
it break in the middle i could

1304
00:45:28,855 --> 00:45:30,595
feel it breaking okay so you're usually

1305
00:45:30,655 --> 00:45:32,575
so structurally oh yeah sounds nice to

1306
00:45:32,575 --> 00:45:33,835
me no and now we had to

1307
00:45:33,835 --> 00:45:35,095
talk about when we got to the

1308
00:45:35,125 --> 00:45:36,865
bar and the ladies who were having

1309
00:45:36,865 --> 00:45:39,025
their batch so paid jesus or their

1310
00:45:39,085 --> 00:45:41,215
rival party and they wouldn't get out

1311
00:45:41,215 --> 00:45:42,865
of the fucking doorway and they were

1312
00:45:42,865 --> 00:45:44,611
acting like they owned that place yeah

1313
00:45:44,611 --> 00:45:46,045
like yeah and it was there where

1314
00:45:46,075 --> 00:45:46,945
she so they

1315
00:45:46,945 --> 00:45:47,905
they were gonna check us off a

1316
00:45:47,905 --> 00:45:49,495
guest list as we were approaching like

1317
00:45:49,495 --> 00:45:51,745
because they were so we're basically blocking

1318
00:45:52,525 --> 00:45:53,935
the entrance you enter the only way

1319
00:45:53,965 --> 00:45:55,490
yeah when we're carrying this huge cookie

1320
00:45:55,495 --> 00:45:58,135
cake that no one respected this cookie

1321
00:45:58,135 --> 00:46:00,475
cake here's why the cookie cake should

1322
00:46:00,475 --> 00:46:01,585
have been on a scale that said

1323
00:46:01,585 --> 00:46:03,445
how much it weighed yeah this should

1324
00:46:03,474 --> 00:46:05,485
be a doll and we should be

1325
00:46:05,485 --> 00:46:06,865
showing every yes this

1326
00:46:07,105 --> 00:46:08,695
thirty five lb cookie yeah what would

1327
00:46:08,695 --> 00:46:10,645
you guys i would say seven pounds

1328
00:46:10,645 --> 00:46:12,505
to ten pounds fifty pounds

1329
00:46:14,965 --> 00:46:17,665
i think it probably will see i

1330
00:46:17,665 --> 00:46:20,605
lift a lot of weights usually usually

1331
00:46:20,605 --> 00:46:21,805
deadlift like ten

1332
00:46:24,685 --> 00:46:26,695
somewhere in there yeah

1333
00:46:27,985 --> 00:46:29,575
those at the at the hotel the

1334
00:46:29,575 --> 00:46:30,775
other day she's telling us where the

1335
00:46:30,775 --> 00:46:32,305
jib was and anytime anyone tells us

1336
00:46:32,305 --> 00:46:33,415
where the oh my god i have

1337
00:46:33,415 --> 00:46:34,765
to say like okay cool because i'm

1338
00:46:34,765 --> 00:46:35,785

1339
00:46:35,785 --> 00:46:37,645
in there obviously so

1340
00:46:38,785 --> 00:46:41,245
and luckily she when they tell you

1341
00:46:41,365 --> 00:46:42,865
where the gym is that means i

1342
00:46:42,865 --> 00:46:44,515
think maybe i'll go to the gym

1343
00:46:44,845 --> 00:46:46,315
i could go to happen and then

1344
00:46:46,315 --> 00:46:48,775

two hours i have before the show

i feel like i do every year

1401
00:48:51,235 --> 00:48:53,124
and then it ended up being a

1402
00:48:53,124 --> 00:48:54,745
really nice day with lots of nice

1403
00:48:54,775 --> 00:48:56,876
comments on instagram and everyone was one

1404
00:48:56,935 --> 00:48:57,025
hang

1405
00:48:57,025 --> 00:48:58,885
hang out with it's i mean because

1406
00:48:58,885 --> 00:49:00,685
i usually just hang i mean you

1407
00:49:00,685 --> 00:49:01,915
know we recorded a show on my

1408
00:49:01,915 --> 00:49:03,595
birthday yeah absolutely but um other than

1409
00:49:03,595 --> 00:49:06,295
that i'm just at home yeah i

1410
00:49:06,295 --> 00:49:07,585
was thinking it must have been nice

1411
00:49:07,585 --> 00:49:09,865
to have you know hundreds of people

1412
00:49:10,705 --> 00:49:12,445
you know laughing at what you do

1413
00:49:12,445 --> 00:49:14,785
loved me on my birthday around friends

1414
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:16,165
as well it's true it was actually

1415
00:49:16,165 --> 00:49:17,185
a perfect ah

1416
00:49:17,185 --> 00:49:19,345
way to celebrate on stage birthdays are

1417
00:49:19,345 --> 00:49:20,395
really nice i've done that a few

1418
00:49:20,425 --> 00:49:22,195
times and it is like doing a

1419
00:49:22,195 --> 00:49:23,245
thing that you really like to do

1420
00:49:23,245 --> 00:49:25,465
on your birthday because i think typically

1421
00:49:25,465 --> 00:49:26,725
because this came up just this was

1422
00:49:26,725 --> 00:49:28,495
just the dates that we got whatever

1423
00:49:28,495 --> 00:49:31,375
organically but i never book a show

1424
00:49:31,375 --> 00:49:32,665
on my work i would never agree

1425
00:49:32,665 --> 00:49:33,895
to do a show on my birthday

1426
00:49:34,451 --> 00:49:35,905
yeah thinking someone i want to do

1427
00:49:35,905 --> 00:49:36,685
something else

1428
00:49:37,645 --> 00:49:38,455
it might have been but it might

1429
00:49:38,455 --> 00:49:39,446
be better to do that and just

1430
00:49:39,446 --> 00:49:40,495
be like go hang out with fun

1431
00:49:40,495 --> 00:49:41,725
people in a fun show who gives

1432
00:49:41,725 --> 00:49:43,135
although i will say i did it

1433
00:49:43,135 --> 00:49:44,305

we got there the show was at

1446
00:50:17,815 --> 00:50:19,195
this place that i thought was a

1447
00:50:19,195 --> 00:50:20,365
theater but it was more of a

1448
00:50:20,365 --> 00:50:23,245
rock club the show started way late

1449
00:50:23,575 --> 00:50:25,105
and then there was like a weird

1450
00:50:25,105 --> 00:50:27,325
intermission so they could sell drinks and

1451
00:50:27,325 --> 00:50:28,195
so by the time i got

on people were hammered and it was

1453
00:50:30,625 --> 00:50:32,335
late and it was a miserable show

1454
00:50:32,335 --> 00:50:33,535
people just like talking through the whole

1455
00:50:33,535 --> 00:50:35,575
thing yeah and then we went to

1456
00:50:35,575 --> 00:50:38,545
this super crowded gross bar afterwards it

1457
00:50:38,545 --> 00:50:41,095

1458
00:50:41,095 --> 00:50:44,365

1481
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:36,650
of your phone and what were you

1482
00:51:36,650 --> 00:51:39,260
playing in the bags if it was

1483
00:51:39,290 --> 00:51:42,290
instagram ryan is looking at instagram while

1484
00:51:42,290 --> 00:51:44,510
he records the show with this phone

1485
00:51:44,510 --> 00:51:45,620
on with the volume up

1486
00:51:45,650 --> 00:51:49,790
me too much yeah who is it

1487
00:51:49,790 --> 00:51:51,800
fair point but sometimes you you can

1488
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:53,720
accidentally hit that volume with your thumb

1489
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:55,130
but you don't realize you're turn the

1490
00:51:55,130 --> 00:51:56,540
volume it's not that was part of

1491
00:51:56,540 --> 00:51:58,760
our no phones in the bedroom policy

1492
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:01,070
because sometimes you're scrolling through things you

1493
00:52:01,070 --> 00:52:03,140
actually hit something it's very jarring you

1494
00:52:03,140 --> 00:52:05,150
know what the worst thing for me

1495
00:52:05,150 --> 00:52:05,510
is

1496
00:52:06,057 --> 00:52:08,360

1513
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:42,170
friends

1514
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:43,760
yeah

1515
00:52:44,930 --> 00:52:46,640
fuck but this should be illegal in

1516
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:48,320
my opinion so you turn the volume

1517
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:50,300
all the way down yeah and you

1518
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:51,740
have the volume off on your phone

1519
00:52:51,770 --> 00:52:53,450
yes but there is one ad on

1520
00:52:53,450 --> 00:52:54,770
where's of friends it comes up every

1521
00:52:54,770 --> 00:52:59,690
like eleven ads that just blasts now

1522
00:52:59,690 --> 00:53:01,910
here's my question what's in the five

1523
00:53:01,910 --> 00:53:04,700
dollars for ad-free at one point

1524
00:53:05,060 --> 00:53:06,920
they they offered that back in the

1525
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:09,380
day but now he is now scott

1526
00:53:09,380 --> 00:53:10,790
you're an influencer we'd like to offer

1527
00:53:10,790 --> 00:53:12,740
you ad free words you could buy

1528
00:53:12,740 --> 00:53:14,540
it for like literally like a dollar

1529
00:53:14,540 --> 00:53:15,950
or five dollars or something like that

1530
00:53:15,950 --> 00:53:17,480
i regret the day i do it

1531
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:19,010
because i don't think they offer it

1532
00:53:19,010 --> 00:53:20,210
now because they make so much money

1533
00:53:20,210 --> 00:53:22,970
on ads oh man listen um but

1534
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,620
yeah i paid five dollars i think

1535
00:53:24,650 --> 00:53:25,220
one of the best

1536
00:53:25,220 --> 00:53:26,840

is like what's we're both wearing suits

1865
01:06:05,700 --> 01:06:07,260

1867
01:06:10,920 --> 01:06:13,050

1970
01:10:17,073 --> 01:10:18,300

01:10:20,610 --> 01:10:22,920
protesting us so yeah we've seen it

1973
01:10:23,010 --> 01:10:25,860
yeah keep canceling the o a and

1974
01:10:25,950 --> 01:10:27,150
keep canceling it

1975
01:10:30,540 --> 01:10:33,600
i the problem with that theory is

1976
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:34,980
is that that implies that we would

1977
01:10:34,980 --> 01:10:36,330
have to renew it every day and

1978
01:10:36,330 --> 01:10:38,250
then cancel it every week we could

1979
01:10:38,250 --> 01:10:40,350
just keep announcing that it's canceled okay

1980
01:10:40,350 --> 01:10:42,930
reminding everyone still cancelled you know a

1981
01:10:42,930 --> 01:10:44,880

1982
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:46,290
