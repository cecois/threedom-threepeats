sure that we have ah what they

78
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:54,780
have in sports where they have a

79
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:57,060
license where if something you know is

80
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:59,160
er the news if you hear music

81
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:01,770
in the background of something if you

82
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:03,330

191
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:05,130

192
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:08,370
didn't like it it yeah it was

193
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:09,060
so

194
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,200
it was a place of it's a

195
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,227
workplace why would you have isn't it

196
00:07:15,227 --> 00:07:18,510
a place of worship um it i

197
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:20,670
got scored i feel like it was

198
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:24,000
corny yeah i mean um i feel

199
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,430
like yeah it's ok for old people

200
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:27,510
to be corny you know what i

201
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:30,030
mean but when i saw the picture

202
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:30,240
it look

203
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:30,780
looked bad

204
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,690
look good and i think what it

205
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:35,670
was was that the hearts had no

206
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:38,010
dimension to them so they yeah no

207
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:40,920
dimension they were just very look little

208
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:43,110
cartoons like it was weird and then

209
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:44,670
but what i let you talk they

210
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:47,790
should have been realistic heart's ventricles position

211
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:49,200
i've had they should have had some

212
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,420
some sort of depth to the the

213
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:52,080
paint of them

214
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:54,480
or something but they looked like they

215
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,130
were just clip art or something looks

216
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,970

like a a thing that you do

241
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:55,680

256
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:21,090

bought a van down by the river

379
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:14,730
yeah

380
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:17,129
we bought

381
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:23,670
and the last person to arrive at

382
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,910
ah ah the van to go to

383
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:29,850
the restaurant was ike baron holtz who

384
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:32,070
shut off and already he's much showed

385
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:34,800
up in a in a full airline

386
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:38,220
pirate pilot's uniform carrot like dragging a

387
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:38,340
lie

388
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:40,170
it'll suitcase my area some case

389
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:44,130
it's solely so that he could get

390
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:46,500
to the door of the bus that

391
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:48,180
everybody was waiting for him and say

392
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:50,700
oh hi rit

393
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:54,630
wow yeah that's yeah that's fun

394
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:56,460
yeah that's fun

395
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:58,920
that was the reaction of everyone in

396
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,749
the bus did he make that's what

397
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:03,360
did he make the costume department do

398
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,651
that for him or did he rent

399
00:15:04,651 --> 00:15:06,090
time it sounds i think he rented

400
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:07,260
it on it's own okay so that's

401
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:09,240
ok so giving the costume department more

402
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:12,150
work to do that's probably not the

403
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:14,160
right move especially if they're not invited

404
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,480

408
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,360

be like you are walking separate interests

437
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:31,560
yeah so so poe folks so segregated

438
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:34,590

southern part of it to where we

446
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,830

cam spain but they added ah ah

481
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:03,690
an electric train going around the entire

482
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:05,940
restaurants a giant place it was like

483
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:06,750
the south would have

484
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:09,990
yeah but it it was giant because

485
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:12,540
um it was one of those tourists

486
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,610
you know medieval times kind of tourist

487
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:17,580
places um next to the wax museum

488
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:18,720
and all that where they were just

489
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,180
expecting a giant amount of people in

490
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:22,920
every day and usually they got it

491
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:24,990
it's closed so be fair

492
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:28,710
but so is a giant restaurant with

493
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:30,360
all this southern kitsch all over the

494
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:33,450
walls you know like ah stop signs

495
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,160
yeah no there were there were signs

496
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,510
everywhere it was just like i was

497
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:39,540
at the southern this sounds so half-assed

498
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:42,090
it's making me mad yeah this whole

499
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:46,183
line fried okra and hushpuppies and all

500
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:49,020
all this kind of southern shirt so

501
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:50,580
but in the back they have this

502
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:56,550
like beautiful tree lines ah outdoor place

503
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:58,530
where where they would host you to

504
00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:02,400
host weddings and parties of any sort

505
00:19:02,430 --> 00:19:03,210
to be you would

506
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:05,550
but they they would use the same

507
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:08,610
kitchen from poe folks so so that

508
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:10,230
was sort of a separate business that

509
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:11,820
was owned by the same people but

510
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:14,040
where you like i'd dress up in

511
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:16,980
you know not a tuxedo but ah

512
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:18,930
you know the the parks don't

513
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,180
the taxi don't

514
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:24,210
but you know the party down like

515
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:25,560
bow tie and white shirt and all

516
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:28,200
that stuff no party gown at first

517
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,780
party gowns or my party gown everyone

518
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:32,462
gets your party gowns on who wants

519
00:19:32,462 --> 00:19:33,780
a belly washer and ride on the

520
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:36,570
train but they use the same kitchen

521
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:38,640
so you would essentially get like a

522
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,920
little more upscale versions or the or

523
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,390
the po folks menu

524
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:44,400
that was the best stuff you know

525
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:47,580
same food but make it better

526
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:51,930
um so after that then i went

527
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:54,780
to college and the and i worked

528
00:19:54,780 --> 00:20:01,170
a bigger square in college ah yeah

529
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:06,030
and baker square as opposed as opposed

530
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:07,770
to marie calendar's where they let us

531
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:10,680
take home full pies and cakes and

532
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,330

533
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:14,910
yes a bigger square was the first

534
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:16,860
restaurant i'd ever worked at where they

535
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:18,660

right anyway the dumpster lock-on dumpster locks

537
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:22,500
yeah that's so discuss

538
00:20:23,275 --> 00:20:26,275
damn bait it's what they say because

539
00:20:26,335 --> 00:20:28,675
if any homeless person were to eat

540
00:20:28,675 --> 00:20:30,115
any food and get sick they would

541
00:20:30,115 --> 00:20:31,435
be able to sue them for millions

542
00:20:31,435 --> 00:20:32,905
of dollars actually which is what i

543
00:20:32,905 --> 00:20:34,435

dino true true but but this this

600
00:22:43,465 --> 00:22:44,845

be looking at him for bill murray

609
00:23:00,535 --> 00:23:02,785

he said that like the sides

613
00:23:10,885 --> 00:23:11,755
but that was where i learned how

614
00:23:11,755 --> 00:23:14,065
to fax something and so i was

615
00:23:14,065 --> 00:23:15,415
able to put that on my resume

616
00:23:15,445 --> 00:23:16,495
we're getting far afield

617
00:23:17,905 --> 00:23:19,615
next restaurant i learned how to fax

618
00:23:19,645 --> 00:23:21,925
um as a kid because my dad

619
00:23:21,925 --> 00:23:23,215
had a fax machine and i would

620
00:23:23,215 --> 00:23:25,495
fax my aunt at her work at

621
00:23:25,495 --> 00:23:27,205
the court she worked at actually talked

622
00:23:27,205 --> 00:23:29,515
to the mayor's office in indiana at

623
00:23:29,515 --> 00:23:30,505
that point and i would send her

624
00:23:30,505 --> 00:23:32,545
faxes and then she'd send me really

625
00:23:32,545 --> 00:23:34,525
legit faxes from the mayor's office and

626
00:23:34,525 --> 00:23:35,695
they were really funny and i have

627
00:23:35,695 --> 00:23:37,615

mine were a child right right messages

and then i would send it to

631
00:23:43,105 --> 00:23:44,395
her and then she would write back

632
00:23:44,575 --> 00:23:46,615
with the mayor's letterhead and then it

633
00:23:46,615 --> 00:23:48,715
would be like something about the front

634
00:23:48,715 --> 00:23:50,695
message from the mayor and then consider

635
00:23:51,385 --> 00:23:52,795

636
00:23:57,205 --> 00:23:58,906

641
00:24:11,665 --> 00:24:13,585
a thing that um

to do your your picture and resume

647
00:24:23,575 --> 00:24:25,585
sometimes yes some people were only reachable

648
00:24:25,585 --> 00:24:27,625
by fax it was such a stupid

649
00:24:27,625 --> 00:24:31,105
short-lived thing that the idea of at

650
00:24:31,105 --> 00:24:32,815
least some great importance on the idea

651
00:24:32,815 --> 00:24:34,165
of someone having their fax machine

652
00:24:34,932 --> 00:24:37,105

a person who's like sending their headshot

654
00:24:38,965 --> 00:24:40,075
through and then the

655
00:24:41,455 --> 00:24:42,805
the first thing getting in there like

beepers which my roommate had a b

672
00:25:20,395 --> 00:25:21,805
i did have a beeper oh you

673
00:25:21,805 --> 00:25:23,095
had a paper i had a beeper

674
00:25:23,305 --> 00:25:25,525
in the high school when some people

675
00:25:25,525 --> 00:25:26,515
had cell phones but i had a

676
00:25:26,515 --> 00:25:28,375
pager that you would i might have

677
00:25:28,375 --> 00:25:29,605
told this story before but

678
00:25:30,865 --> 00:25:32,845
you could was a doctor yes so

679
00:25:32,845 --> 00:25:33,595
i was doctor knows

680
00:25:34,915 --> 00:25:36,085
and i'd have to go to work

681
00:25:37,465 --> 00:25:40,105
hey there it was like you could

682
00:25:40,105 --> 00:25:41,755
call and you would leave a message

683
00:25:41,755 --> 00:25:43,525
with an operator and then the operator

684
00:25:43,525 --> 00:25:45,655
would type out the message to me

685
00:25:45,685 --> 00:25:46,795
on my beeper so it had like

686
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:48,685
a little text on it oh but

687
00:25:48,685 --> 00:25:50,455
it was always wrong and it always

688
00:25:50,455 --> 00:25:52,285
made no sense like i don't know

689
00:25:52,285 --> 00:25:53,665
if it was an automated thing that

690
00:25:53,665 --> 00:25:54,655
was typing it or if the person

691
00:25:54,655 --> 00:25:55,885
just kind of type whatever they heard

692
00:25:55,885 --> 00:25:56,725
and they didn't try to make it

693
00:25:56,725 --> 00:25:57,445
make sense but it

694
00:25:57,478 --> 00:25:59,605
always made no sense and then you

695
00:25:59,605 --> 00:26:00,655
have to figure out who it was

696
00:26:00,655 --> 00:26:01,915
from and then try to call them

697
00:26:01,915 --> 00:26:03,925
back and i really loved it though

698
00:26:03,925 --> 00:26:04,975
i thought it was really cool and

699
00:26:04,975 --> 00:26:06,595

700
00:26:09,505 --> 00:26:11,335

i didn't have a car so i

713
00:26:42,205 --> 00:26:43,975
had to figure out the bus schedule

00:26:44,035 --> 00:26:46,255
and um take two different buses i

715
00:26:46,255 --> 00:26:47,245

716
00:26:47,245 --> 00:26:50,995
have to walk to the bus station

717
00:26:51,085 --> 00:26:53,425
about ah maybe a quarter of a

718
00:26:53,425 --> 00:26:56,005
mile take a bus to beach boulevard

719
00:26:56,005 --> 00:26:58,585
hard than wait around for another bus

720
00:26:58,615 --> 00:27:00,925
and the worst is when your first

721
00:27:00,925 --> 00:27:03,055
bus arrives and you see the second

722
00:27:03,055 --> 00:27:05,155
bus leaving yeah yeah from the second

723
00:27:05,185 --> 00:27:06,775

something and we were really broke and

735
00:27:29,335 --> 00:27:30,985
so we shared hotel room and we

736
00:27:31,165 --> 00:27:33,355
bought like peanut butter and bread and

737
00:27:33,355 --> 00:27:35,335
we were basically eating like just whatever

738
00:27:35,395 --> 00:27:36,568

00:27:36,568 --> 00:27:37,975

00:27:40,585 --> 00:27:42,055
at some point and so we were

743
00:27:42,055 --> 00:27:43,015
like okay we're going to find an

744
00:27:43,015 --> 00:27:44,545

745
00:27:44,545 --> 00:27:46,465
yeah yeah we're gonna go to applebee's

746
00:27:46,975 --> 00:27:50,185
and we took multiple buses i was

747
00:27:50,245 --> 00:27:52,705
it was so far away we took

748
00:27:52,705 --> 00:27:53,965
like a buzz i mean it was

749
00:27:54,085 --> 00:27:55,105
it was really fun like we have

750
00:27:55,105 --> 00:27:56,485
like agree it was a hilarious time

751
00:27:56,485 --> 00:27:57,775
but it was just kind of funny

752
00:27:58,045 --> 00:27:58,165
we

753
00:27:58,165 --> 00:27:59,305
i took a bus really far and

754
00:27:59,305 --> 00:28:00,985
then we walked along a highway for

755
00:28:00,985 --> 00:28:03,235
a long time like in grass like

756
00:28:04,036 --> 00:28:05,545
today go there and it was like

757
00:28:05,815 --> 00:28:07,465
just the middle of nowhere and then

758
00:28:07,465 --> 00:28:09,415
we had like a shitty meal and

759
00:28:09,655 --> 00:28:10,555
you know of course still had to

760
00:28:10,555 --> 00:28:11,785
pay ten dollars on top of it

761
00:28:11,785 --> 00:28:13,165
or whatever we're like annoyed by that

762
00:28:13,435 --> 00:28:14,995
and then take the bus all the

763
00:28:14,995 --> 00:28:16,585
way back and it was just the

764
00:28:16,585 --> 00:28:18,325
time i used to do the

765
00:28:18,325 --> 00:28:20,365
the ah the comedy club in austin

766
00:28:20,395 --> 00:28:22,644
cap city which i closed down and

767
00:28:22,644 --> 00:28:25,285
i guess is reopening um but they

768
00:28:25,285 --> 00:28:26,815
used to put you up at this

769
00:28:26,845 --> 00:28:29,515
terrible hotel and the reason they put

770
00:28:29,515 --> 00:28:30,355
you up at the hotel was it

771
00:28:30,355 --> 00:28:31,945
was close to the comedy club which

772
00:28:31,945 --> 00:28:33,955
is where you spend the least amount

773
00:28:33,955 --> 00:28:36,475
of time while you're there it's like

774
00:28:36,625 --> 00:28:38,155
you're at the comedy club for ninety

775
00:28:38,155 --> 00:28:38,485
minutes

776
00:28:38,665 --> 00:28:40,075
and then the rest of the time

777
00:28:40,075 --> 00:28:41,815
you're just in the middle of nowhere

778
00:28:41,905 --> 00:28:45,115
yeah um and i remember how hard

779
00:28:45,115 --> 00:28:47,305
it was to get around without a

780
00:28:47,305 --> 00:28:50,635
car um you would you would often

781
00:28:50,635 --> 00:28:52,285
be what if if you were walking

782
00:28:52,285 --> 00:28:53,875
anything it would be grasped by the

783
00:28:53,875 --> 00:28:55,645
side of the highway yeah just to

784
00:28:55,645 --> 00:28:57,175
go get lunch or something at a

785
00:28:57,175 --> 00:28:58,615
denny's well that's that seems

786
00:28:58,645 --> 00:29:01,435
like an austin specific memory because it's

787
00:29:01,458 --> 00:29:03,475
quite a few south by southwest walking

788
00:29:03,475 --> 00:29:05,095
along the highway yeah good is that

789
00:29:05,095 --> 00:29:06,595
just an austin that's how you have

790
00:29:06,595 --> 00:29:08,005
to get everywhere i don't know i

791
00:29:08,005 --> 00:29:09,385
think it's just because it's so spread

792
00:29:09,385 --> 00:29:10,855
out i guess yeah and like there's

793
00:29:10,855 --> 00:29:12,745
concentrated areas where stuff is going on

794
00:29:12,745 --> 00:29:13,585
but if you're not one of those

795
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:16,435
areas you're just fucked up this hotel

796
00:29:16,465 --> 00:29:17,785
it was a best western that i

797
00:29:17,785 --> 00:29:18,805
guess at

798
00:29:18,850 --> 00:29:21,175
some point they they busted a prostitution

799
00:29:21,175 --> 00:29:24,055
ring that was happening there um i

800
00:29:24,355 --> 00:29:26,725
i was in a room with a

801
00:29:26,739 --> 00:29:27,655
probably my smoke

802
00:29:29,065 --> 00:29:31,315

865
00:31:50,745 --> 00:31:52,485
i don't smoke but i'm like what

866
00:31:52,485 --> 00:31:54,735
does it fucking say that works so

867
00:31:54,735 --> 00:31:57,675
wow i'll tell you i'll tell you

868
00:31:57,675 --> 00:31:59,595
what it is is that it's it's

869
00:31:59,595 --> 00:32:02,985
very it uses almost hypnosis techniques in

870
00:32:02,985 --> 00:32:06,645
a way it's very repetitive um but

871
00:32:06,645 --> 00:32:09,375
what it really did for me was

872
00:32:09,555 --> 00:32:11,085
early on like early on in the

873
00:32:11,085 --> 00:32:15,555
book it got me to admit it

874
00:32:15,555 --> 00:32:17,565
gets you to admit that you don't

875
00:32:17,565 --> 00:32:19,185
enjoy it that you don't enjoy it

876
00:32:19,305 --> 00:32:21,705
yeah yeah that's really what sally was

877
00:32:21,705 --> 00:32:23,415
like you know you says didn't you

878
00:32:23,415 --> 00:32:25,515
say that it says it says don't

879
00:32:25,515 --> 00:32:26,715
stop smoking until the end of the

880
00:32:26,715 --> 00:32:28,365
book but you read the first chapter

881
00:32:28,365 --> 00:32:29,415
and were like i just don't want

882
00:32:29,415 --> 00:32:29,535
to do

883
00:32:29,565 --> 00:32:32,085
this anymore no no no i did

884
00:32:32,085 --> 00:32:33,975
stop smoking before i finished the book

885
00:32:33,975 --> 00:32:35,625
but it but they do tell you

886
00:32:35,625 --> 00:32:37,455
don't don't don't try to stop smoking

887
00:32:37,485 --> 00:32:39,495
and read the book was still smoke

888
00:32:39,495 --> 00:32:40,875
while you read the book and then

889
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:43,845
gradually like the urge fades away it's

890
00:32:43,875 --> 00:32:46,635
it's it's remarkable i recommended it somebody

891
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:48,405
before people ask me it is called

892
00:32:48,945 --> 00:32:49,695
the easy way

893
00:32:49,695 --> 00:32:52,215
way to stop smoking by allen carr

894
00:32:52,725 --> 00:32:55,785
um and i have ah i've recommended

895
00:32:55,785 --> 00:32:57,405
it to so many people and it

896
00:32:57,405 --> 00:32:59,385
works it works like a charm for

897
00:32:59,385 --> 00:33:01,065
most people i got to say and

898
00:33:01,065 --> 00:33:03,255
i and for me i i had

899
00:33:03,255 --> 00:33:05,595
it on my coffee table for a

900
00:33:05,595 --> 00:33:07,275
year before i read it

901
00:33:08,445 --> 00:33:09,435
yeah and then once i did i

902
00:33:09,435 --> 00:33:11,445
was like that was it do you

903
00:33:11,445 --> 00:33:12,915
wish you you would have read it

904
00:33:12,915 --> 00:33:14,145
earlier in the year or do you

905
00:33:14,145 --> 00:33:15,045
think that you were just in the

906
00:33:15,045 --> 00:33:16,995
right oh my i wish yeah i

907
00:33:17,025 --> 00:33:20,265
think it was that ah i had

908
00:33:20,265 --> 00:33:22,005
to get to the point where like

909
00:33:22,005 --> 00:33:24,225
when i first got the book i

910
00:33:24,255 --> 00:33:25,575
think it was that i know this

911
00:33:25,575 --> 00:33:26,955
is not good for me and i

912
00:33:26,955 --> 00:33:28,215
shouldn't do it anymore

913
00:33:28,575 --> 00:33:30,885
but i wasn't yet intellectually yes but

914
00:33:30,885 --> 00:33:32,295
i wasn't either the fatigue point of

915
00:33:32,295 --> 00:33:33,705
it where it's like i don't like

916
00:33:33,705 --> 00:33:34,545
this but i don't know how to

917
00:33:34,545 --> 00:33:37,395
stop doing it yeah and the book

918
00:33:37,605 --> 00:33:39,735
the book really just kind of laid

919
00:33:39,735 --> 00:33:41,805
it all out in a very logical

920
00:33:42,225 --> 00:33:44,475
way that in a logical way that

921
00:33:44,475 --> 00:33:46,665
also so really zeroed in on your

922
00:33:46,665 --> 00:33:48,735
emotions about it and

923
00:33:48,765 --> 00:33:50,775
so you are it's like sort of

924
00:33:50,775 --> 00:33:53,625
admitting you're just you're just admitting something

925
00:33:53,625 --> 00:33:55,275
to yourself and then it all like

926
00:33:55,275 --> 00:33:58,005
falls away do you are you bummed

927
00:33:58,005 --> 00:33:59,355
that you don't look cool anymore

928
00:34:00,525 --> 00:34:04,155
that's my one regret that's why sometimes

929
00:34:04,155 --> 00:34:06,645
late at night janie sleep i'll hold

930
00:34:06,645 --> 00:34:09,195
up a pencil and looking mirror and

931
00:34:09,195 --> 00:34:11,145
i'm smoking sort of the silhouette maybe

932
00:34:11,265 --> 00:34:12,705
sweetly can you stand in front of

933
00:34:12,705 --> 00:34:14,295
a bright window and yeah that's right

934
00:34:14,295 --> 00:34:14,985
she's like why do you have all

935
00:34:14,985 --> 00:34:16,335
these golf pencils and i'm like don't

936
00:34:16,335 --> 00:34:17,115
worry about it

937
00:34:18,405 --> 00:34:19,395
okay look we have to take a

938
00:34:19,395 --> 00:34:20,715
break but when we come back i'll

939
00:34:20,715 --> 00:34:21,945
finish restaurant roundup

940
00:34:28,695 --> 00:34:31,755
okay we're back and apologized during the

941
00:34:31,755 --> 00:34:33,405
break we're discussing whether it should be

942
00:34:33,405 --> 00:34:36,135
restaurant roundup or restaurant ramble because he

943
00:34:36,195 --> 00:34:38,085
believes that around it would be over

944
00:34:38,085 --> 00:34:40,935
by now but ah you are clearly

945
00:34:40,935 --> 00:34:42,765
rambling and just to be clear during

946
00:34:42,765 --> 00:34:44,685
the break my opinion was never requested

947
00:34:44,865 --> 00:34:48,015
ah also to me even clearer the

948
00:34:48,015 --> 00:34:48,255
break

949
00:34:48,285 --> 00:34:50,325
was two seconds long that's right but

950
00:34:50,325 --> 00:34:51,975
i prefer to get this on mike

951
00:34:54,105 --> 00:34:55,275
um what do you what do you

952
00:34:55,275 --> 00:34:56,205
think it is a ramble

953
00:34:57,465 --> 00:35:00,255
i think it's um the restaurant roundup

954
00:35:00,255 --> 00:35:02,445
ramble i'd like to hear about all

ah you know the city so big

00:37:10,215 --> 00:37:12,075
that it really made me go oh

1017
00:37:12,075 --> 00:37:14,685
i see where everything is what the

1018
00:37:14,685 --> 00:37:16,485

1019
00:37:16,485 --> 00:37:17,805

00:37:19,125 --> 00:37:20,175
really loved it too so

1022
00:37:20,385 --> 00:37:22,571
anyway and then you got right ahead

1023
00:37:22,575 --> 00:37:24,435
aircraft flowers not to go off track

1024
00:37:24,435 --> 00:37:27,255
about these restaurants or if we are

1025
00:37:27,285 --> 00:37:29,205
constantly trying to take things from mike

1026
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:31,005
today why don't you leave us alone

1027
00:37:32,415 --> 00:37:34,305
as anyone in the james bond martini

1028
00:37:34,305 --> 00:37:36,555
restaurant and hated all the martinis yes

1029
00:37:36,615 --> 00:37:38,925
he is charlie likes his vod straight

1030
00:37:38,925 --> 00:37:40,335
vodka that tours

1031
00:37:40,335 --> 00:37:41,835
started with talking about how he likes

1032
00:37:41,835 --> 00:37:44,355
martinis now then him complaining about every

1033
00:37:44,355 --> 00:37:46,785
my team ever got me because he

1034
00:37:46,785 --> 00:37:48,525
had martinis at a party at like

1035
00:37:48,525 --> 00:37:51,165
a backyard party and we figured out

1036
00:37:51,195 --> 00:37:53,385
all it was was just straight vodka

1037
00:37:53,415 --> 00:37:55,455
into a glass yeah with an olive

1038
00:37:55,485 --> 00:37:58,605
or something maybe be but but i

1039
00:37:58,605 --> 00:38:00,495
don't think he had any ah what

1040
00:38:00,555 --> 00:38:01,965
what do you put martinis again you

1041
00:38:02,055 --> 00:38:03,525
the vermouth i don't think he added

1042
00:38:03,555 --> 00:38:04,875
vermont he was because anytime he had

1043
00:38:04,905 --> 00:38:07,035
any martini after that with vermouth he

1044
00:38:07,035 --> 00:38:09,885

my little about well we were talking

1093

about a certain celebrity who there were

1094
00:39:52,575 --> 00:39:55,695
rumors about um them having murdered someone

1095
00:39:55,695 --> 00:39:58,035
and and someone we know and and

1096
00:39:58,035 --> 00:40:00,465
someone paul is intimately familiar with said

it was it could contribute to that

1108
00:40:21,075 --> 00:40:23,385
i mean like that that o j

1109
00:40:23,415 --> 00:40:25,995
um made an america doc

1110
00:40:26,685 --> 00:40:27,789
have you seen that if you've seen

1111
00:40:27,789 --> 00:40:29,985
that no yeah i don't think i

1112
00:40:29,985 --> 00:40:31,395
read a lot of the books oh

1113
00:40:31,490 --> 00:40:33,405
and it was so that doc is

1114
00:40:33,405 --> 00:40:35,655
so good it's so well done and

1115
00:40:35,655 --> 00:40:38,025
it gives you a real history of

1116
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:43,110
yeah racism in los angeles right and

1117
00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:46,860
it's it's it really explains it not

1118
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:49,140
explained but it it sort of illustrates

1119
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:50,580
how was the line from the rodney

1120
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:53,520
king oh from further back than that

1121
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:55,050
yeah oh sure the watson further back

1122
00:40:55,050 --> 00:40:56,910
than that yeah like everything that built

1123
00:40:56,940 --> 00:40:59,460
up to ah what could have caused

1124
00:40:59,520 --> 00:40:59,910
o j

1125
00:41:00,010 --> 00:41:03,180
to be um ah kind of not

1126
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:07,080
in a good frame of mind yeah

1127
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:08,970
i have to say the jeffrey toobin

1128
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,550
and people you know condemn him for

1129
00:41:11,550 --> 00:41:14,850
being a famous masturbator but his books

1130
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,220
about the o j book is great

1131
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,290
and his patty hearst book is really

1132
00:41:19,290 --> 00:41:19,830
good i mean

1133
00:41:20,072 --> 00:41:21,510
heard that there was stuff in the

1134
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:23,160
patty hearst book that like the whole

1135
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:25,770
fact of of daryl gates how he

1136
00:41:25,770 --> 00:41:27,270
rose to prominence and the and the

1137
00:41:27,270 --> 00:41:28,890
fact that when they shot up the

1138
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,960
patty hearst hide out it was on

1139
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,610
live television that was the first time

1140
00:41:32,610 --> 00:41:35,310
that had ever happened um that they

1141
00:41:35,310 --> 00:41:37,470
had ever broadcast live on the on

1142
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:39,720
tv like a police thing like that

1143
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:40,200
which led to

1144
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:41,760
chases and all that kinda stuff but

1145
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,260
those those books are if you can

1146
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:45,540
look past the fact that every other

1147
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:48,120
sentence he was jerking it they're they're

1148
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:49,770
really really i'll move down from that

1149
00:41:49,770 --> 00:41:51,480
very quickly didn't we well his author

1150
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:55,018
photos his penis if we also didn't

1151
00:41:55,018 --> 00:41:55,290
know

1152
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:58,620
i feel like it would be fun

1153
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,000
and i don't mean for any of

1154
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,740
the people involved but i always like

1155
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:03,570
a good trial on tv like when

1156
00:42:03,570 --> 00:42:05,430
you're tuning in to see the trial

1157
00:42:05,970 --> 00:42:08,130
and i would like one of those

1158
00:42:08,130 --> 00:42:09,600
but it feels like right now it's

1159
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:10,920
not really a time for a jury

1160
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:12,510
and all that stuff i mean regardless

1161
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:14,280
ignoring impeachment i don't care about that

1162
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:16,110
i didn't even think about that how

1163
00:42:16,110 --> 00:42:16,470
they are how

1164
00:42:16,470 --> 00:42:19,410
handling jury duty well because i've gotten

1165
00:42:19,410 --> 00:42:20,880
jury duty and started my yeah and

1166
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,350
we both never had to go

1167
00:42:23,430 --> 00:42:24,330
and i'm sorry

1168
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:28,530
cut out all my coughing um even

1169
00:42:28,530 --> 00:42:30,960
enjoy lee but we both we both

1170
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,190
didn't have to go like we had

1171
00:42:32,190 --> 00:42:33,720
to check in online every night and

1172
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:34,530
we didn't go and i was like

1173
00:42:34,530 --> 00:42:36,660
i'm sure today i'm sharing ny having

1174
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:38,190
us come i'm sure they say like

1175
00:42:38,250 --> 00:42:41,070
oh we've made it safe or whatever

1176
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:43,170
and it's hear anything about it that's

1177
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:45,510
but i trust store i wouldn't try

1178
00:42:45,510 --> 00:42:46,560
just it but i thought it was

1179
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:48,960
more like they are just going we

1180
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,400
have to go through the system of

1181
00:42:50,550 --> 00:42:52,165
asking people to come you have to

1182
00:42:52,165 --> 00:42:53,310
say you're gonna go and then you

1183
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:55,140
want to go and then you get

1184
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:55,980
off the hook for a year well

1185
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:57,510
maybe it's an everyone goes to jail

1186
00:42:57,660 --> 00:42:58,830
it might be a zoo trial though

1187
00:42:58,830 --> 00:43:01,290
too i don't know zoom trial yeah

1188
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:03,750
mary kate olsen was getting divorced on

1189
00:43:03,750 --> 00:43:05,670
zoom nice right

1190
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:08,070
yeah that was weird to see screencaps

1191
00:43:08,070 --> 00:43:10,260
of someone's divorce i didn't feel appropriate

1192
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:12,360
that they know that who was doing

1193
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:14,190
that i don't know

1194
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:17,220
someone someone who was like reporting on

1195
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:18,930
it or something was like i got

1196
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:21,570
to watch this today click this seems

1197
00:43:21,570 --> 00:43:23,340
weirdly yeah i don't know why there

1198
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:25,890
would be anyone that was outside of

1199
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:29,400
that proceeding that would be watching much

1200
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:31,290
less anyone in the proceeding saying i'm

1201
00:43:31,290 --> 00:43:32,730
going to take a sneaky little screencap

1202
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:34,740
yeah oh my god imagine if you

1203
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:35,430
were we

1204
00:43:35,430 --> 00:43:36,510
watching that and then you did the

1205
00:43:36,510 --> 00:43:38,580
screenshot and i went to church

1206
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:42,360
and what has to immediately go who

1207
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:45,000
did that i don't like maybe i've

1208
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,110
talked about this but i don't like

1209
00:43:46,110 --> 00:43:49,470
the fact that nine one one calls

1210
00:43:49,470 --> 00:43:51,360
are public so any time a celebrity

1211
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:53,970
calls nine one one yeah they it

1212
00:43:54,030 --> 00:43:55,770
winds up on tmc the next day

1213
00:43:55,770 --> 00:43:57,390
like it's so worse one of the

1214
00:43:57,390 --> 00:43:58,800
worst moments of their own life so

1215
00:43:58,800 --> 00:43:59,130
like

1216
00:43:59,490 --> 00:44:00,930
that's in your head when you're calling

1217
00:44:00,930 --> 00:44:02,160
nine one one of like i've got

1218
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:06,330
to sound appropriately like either composed or

1219
00:44:06,330 --> 00:44:09,060
not composed or yeah usually people are

1220
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:10,260
i don't think you're supposed to have

1221
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:12,120
a sociopathic thought about how you're supposed

1222
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:13,140
to but

1223
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:16,080
but it can get in i wonder

1224
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:17,880
if real red flag life has ever

1225
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:19,530
gotten in anyone's head where they're like

1226
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:21,720
okay you call because i can't because

1227
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:24,150
they'll release this or something oh i

1228
00:44:24,150 --> 00:44:25,710
don't know not i mean does seem

1229
00:44:25,710 --> 00:44:27,690
like in an emergency situation you can't

1230
00:44:27,690 --> 00:44:29,220
be thinking like that i would if

1231
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:31,620
you did oh i love person than

1232
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:32,940
you are thinking like that and you

1233
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:33,480
go here i've

1234
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:35,610
sound composed but not composed know but

1235
00:44:35,610 --> 00:44:37,110
that's how i feel is is it

1236
00:44:37,110 --> 00:44:38,700
shouldn't even be an issue for people

1237
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:40,080
like it shouldn't even pop in anyone's

1238
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:41,700
head well yeah channels yeah we don't

1239
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:43,980
we haven't established that it does it

1240
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:45,510
does this is who do you mean

1241
00:44:45,510 --> 00:44:48,060
it does speak have you called one

1242
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:48,300
one

1243
00:44:49,350 --> 00:44:52,770
every day every day what time is

1244
00:44:52,770 --> 00:44:55,140
it i think like an emergency tmc

1245
00:44:55,140 --> 00:44:58,200
is is they have no morals and

1246
00:44:58,200 --> 00:44:59,460
they don't care no and they just

1247
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:02,100
discussed go deep into whatever it takes

1248
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:03,810
to get any information it's it's in

1249
00:45:03,810 --> 00:45:05,880
their name their lack of their lack

1250
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:07,800
of ethics and you know what i

1251
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:09,450
mean it's just like what is tmc

1252
00:45:09,515 --> 00:45:11,670
i'm thirty zone yeah it's like we'll

1253
00:45:11,670 --> 00:45:13,080
get as close to you as we're

1254
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:15,510
allowed together that well no thirty mile

1255
00:45:15,510 --> 00:45:18,000
zone refers to the um it refers

1256
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,367
to the filming area filming area the

1257
00:45:20,367 --> 00:45:22,560
zone yeah but does that mean the

1258
00:45:22,590 --> 00:45:25,350
filming area ah it's you know how

1259
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:27,540
um when you has this real yeah

1260
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:29,460
it is so yeah everyone

1261
00:45:29,730 --> 00:45:31,740
because of it but it's remember when

1262
00:45:31,740 --> 00:45:32,940
we were making them between two ferns

1263
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:35,070
movie like the furthest yeah places that

1264
00:45:35,070 --> 00:45:38,070
we would go that's like within a

1265
00:45:38,070 --> 00:45:39,900
thirty mile zone is where all of

1266
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:43,680
the um all of the union stuff

1267
00:45:43,860 --> 00:45:45,810
ah like if you film within that

1268
00:45:45,810 --> 00:45:47,340
zone then we don't have to pay

1269
00:45:47,340 --> 00:45:49,500
extra for travel all this kind of

1270
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:49,830
stuff

1271
00:45:49,860 --> 00:45:51,750
so there are these like weird little

1272
00:45:51,750 --> 00:45:53,220
towns that are right on the edge

1273
00:45:53,220 --> 00:45:54,600
of the zone which is like as

1274
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:56,040
far out as you can go before

1275
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:57,600
you have to start paying everyone extra

1276
00:45:58,170 --> 00:45:59,850
so that's so they call the thirty

1277
00:45:59,850 --> 00:46:02,550
mile zone is essentially tmc is covering

1278
00:46:02,550 --> 00:46:04,830
this thirty mile zone of like where

1279
00:46:04,830 --> 00:46:05,850
celebrities are

1280
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:09,930
so pretty gross yeah it's gross yeah

1281
00:46:10,620 --> 00:46:12,420
um do you remember having to call

1282
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:14,610
the time by the way paul morris

1283
00:46:14,610 --> 00:46:17,190
day yeah i remember that yeah and

1284
00:46:17,190 --> 00:46:18,360
they would say hold a mirror up

1285
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:19,560
to the phone and i was like

1286

1329
00:47:51,780 --> 00:47:53,070
thing that we have to bring we

1330
00:47:53,250 --> 00:47:54,300
we have to talk about this but

1331
00:47:54,660 --> 00:47:57,240
i i'm full house ah d j

00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:58,860
wears the same outfit as the teacher

1333
00:47:58,860 --> 00:48:00,000
on the first day of school and

1334
00:48:00,030 --> 00:48:02,070
it's humiliating and then everyone thinks he's

1335
00:48:02,130 --> 00:48:05,790
starting loser buddy and see yeah that's

1336
00:48:05,820 --> 00:48:08,430
really funny price yeah i've never seen

1337
00:48:08,430 --> 00:48:11,220
an episode of oil that's absolutely but

1338
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:13,320
everybody's sad and then she goes

1339
00:48:13,350 --> 00:48:14,670
into the phone booth of the lunch

1340
00:48:14,670 --> 00:48:16,050
room and she just pretends that she's

1341
00:48:16,050 --> 00:48:17,070
on the phone and she's just calling

1342
00:48:17,070 --> 00:48:19,140
the time for like the whole time

1343
00:48:20,430 --> 00:48:21,660
now that's where you know you never

1344
00:48:21,660 --> 00:48:23,100
had to do that because by the

1345
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:24,480
time that you are cognizant of the

1346
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:26,974
time everyone over their cell phones

1347
00:48:28,620 --> 00:48:31,770
um i just think there were clocks

1348
00:48:31,770 --> 00:48:33,420
yeah i just don't know everyone had

1349
00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:36,150
clocks what i guess to call the

1350
00:48:36,150 --> 00:48:37,740
time so you could get set the

1351
00:48:37,740 --> 00:48:39,300
current time to set your clock yeah

1352
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:41,040
yeah so so i never had to

1353
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:44,700
set check probably even in to the

1354
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:46,440
two thousands i think my parents gave

1355
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:48,390
me a clock that automatically

1356
00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:51,300
set itself to the the world clock

1357
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:52,620
or something like that they called the

1358
00:48:52,620 --> 00:48:54,510
most accurate clock ever and then none

1359
00:48:54,510 --> 00:48:56,550
of that stuff within a few years

1360
00:48:56,550 --> 00:48:57,630
they were all out of business because

1361
00:48:57,630 --> 00:48:59,880
cell phones have times that were exact

1362
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:03,330
thing to the atomic clock yeah yeah

1363
00:49:03,330 --> 00:49:04,440
so you had you had to call

1364
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:06,660
the time but but you could hear

1365
00:49:06,660 --> 00:49:08,550
whoever else was calling the time and

1366
00:49:08,580 --> 00:49:10,800
so kids my age that it got

1367
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:13,080
around of like oh yeah well i

1368
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:15,030

1369
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:16,921
this girl shouted her number out and

1370
00:49:16,921 --> 00:49:17,970
i called and i made a date

1371
00:49:17,970 --> 00:49:19,530

olive garden where i worked for three

1442
00:51:49,890 --> 00:51:50,460
days for

1443
00:51:50,460 --> 00:51:51,450
first of all i had to take

1444
00:51:51,450 --> 00:51:53,340
the most insane test i've ever taken

1445
00:51:53,340 --> 00:51:54,600
to work at a restaurant where they

1446
00:51:54,630 --> 00:51:56,160
out hostile look like

1447
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:00,090
no they asked me the ingredients olive

1448
00:52:00,090 --> 00:52:02,580
growing a garden the ingredients of the

1449
00:52:02,580 --> 00:52:04,530
pasta every like you had to know

1450
00:52:04,590 --> 00:52:07,080
every single thing about every dish which

1451
00:52:07,110 --> 00:52:09,300
now when you was just beginning peoples

1452
00:52:10,410 --> 00:52:14,610
spaghetti meatballs okay next now that everyone

1453
00:52:14,610 --> 00:52:16,885
has won his garfield favorite food lasagna

1454
00:52:16,950 --> 00:52:17,250
oh

1455
00:52:19,110 --> 00:52:20,940
now that everyone has food allergies it

1456
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,320
actually makes a lot of sense that

1457
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:23,940
you would have to know every but

1458
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:25,499
but for most of my jobs it's

1459
00:52:25,499 --> 00:52:26,610
just been like oh i'll ask the

1460
00:52:26,610 --> 00:52:28,110
cook and you come back and they

1461
00:52:28,110 --> 00:52:29,430
know you know but you had to

1462
00:52:29,430 --> 00:52:31,500
know the ingredients of every single fanatical

1463
00:52:31,530 --> 00:52:34,200
county breaking my balls law and it

1464
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:37,140
was the longest restaurant with with a

1465
00:52:37,140 --> 00:52:38,100
patio

1466
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:40,140
and he was super long like a

1467
00:52:40,170 --> 00:52:42,540
train car whatever and then your section

1468
00:52:42,570 --> 00:52:43,980
which is the most insane way i've

1469
00:52:43,980 --> 00:52:45,330
ever worked at a restaurant instead of

1470
00:52:45,330 --> 00:52:48,150
having you know six tables next to

1471
00:52:48,150 --> 00:52:50,250
each other you would be stacked on

1472
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:50,640
top

1473
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:54,180
that is crazy you to climb up

1474
00:52:54,180 --> 00:52:55,980
like jakob love cricket team stuff

1475
00:52:57,480 --> 00:52:59,220
no they they they in order to

1476
00:52:59,220 --> 00:53:00,660
make it because i guess some a

1477
00:53:00,660 --> 00:53:02,460
lot of people liked you know being

1478
00:53:02,460 --> 00:53:04,050
on the patio or whatever they and

1479
00:53:04,050 --> 00:53:05,820
that's the most popular so they're trying

1480
00:53:05,820 --> 00:53:07,320
to be fair so they divvied up

1481
00:53:07,530 --> 00:53:09,630
where you would get one table in

1482
00:53:09,660 --> 00:53:11,910
every single part of the restaurant and

1483
00:53:11,910 --> 00:53:13,500
so you'd had to run around the

1484
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:15,300
entire restaurant trying to check on your

1485
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:17,310
tables and it was just

1486
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:19,530
it was crazy so i already was

1487
00:53:19,620 --> 00:53:21,240
was fed up by this place and

1488
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:23,550
then there was a guy who was

1489
00:53:23,610 --> 00:53:27,030
ah ah eighteen and he would follow

1490
00:53:27,030 --> 00:53:29,010
around this older woman who was like

1491
00:53:29,010 --> 00:53:31,890
sixty five or whatever um and tell

1492
00:53:31,890 --> 00:53:34,350
her about every weird al yankovic song

1493
00:53:34,350 --> 00:53:36,150
and what he was parodying and what

1494
00:53:36,150 --> 00:53:37,500
the what his parody was

1495
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:40,170

her during the entire shift and saying

1503
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:55,320

like a surgeon and then he told

1509
00:54:04,140 --> 00:54:05,610
her every lyric that was a parody

1510
00:54:05,610 --> 00:54:06,900

from um you know doing standup and

1778
01:03:53,073 --> 01:03:55,475
philly doing open mics to finally being

able to support myself doing standup

1780
01:03:56,915 --> 01:03:58,415
then i moved out here and i

1781
01:03:58,415 --> 01:03:59,645
had a kind of start all over

1782
01:03:59,645 --> 01:04:01,745
again from scratch yeah and so it

1783
01:04:01,745 --> 01:04:03,005
was an affront to you to have

1784
01:04:03,005 --> 01:04:05,675
to work a day job yes it

1785
01:04:05,675 --> 01:04:06,545
was an insult

1786
01:04:07,835 --> 01:04:10,355
and i couldn't i i did not

1787
01:04:10,355 --> 01:04:13,055
have the ah the psychological tools to

1788
01:04:13,055 --> 01:04:15,545
cope with my situation in life and

1789
01:04:15,545 --> 01:04:17,315
so i decided to take it out

1790
01:04:17,315 --> 01:04:19,625
on the company and i stole like

1791
01:04:19,625 --> 01:04:21,695

1840
01:05:52,322 --> 01:05:55,535
submitted by eric from chicago one person

1841
01:05:55,565 --> 01:05:58,475
the fish thinks of two words that

1842
01:05:58,475 --> 01:06:00,695
rhyme they then give the players two

1843
01:06:00,695 --> 01:06:03,125
synonyms for those words the players must

1844
01:06:03,125 --> 01:06:03,605
then deter

1845
01:06:03,605 --> 01:06:05,735
than what the original rhyming words are

1846
01:06:06,005 --> 01:06:07,835
whoever wins gets to be the rhymer

1847
01:06:07,835 --> 01:06:09,605
next so for example let's say i

1848
01:06:09,605 --> 01:06:11,945
gave you the words furniture tale it's

1849
01:06:11,945 --> 01:06:13,025
your job to figure out what the

1850
01:06:13,025 --> 01:06:14,975
two rhyming words are you can ask

1851
01:06:14,975 --> 01:06:16,505

1854
01:06:23,465 --> 01:06:25,355
pretty clever with the synonyms once you

1855
01:06:25,355 --> 01:06:26,765
get going but it helps to start

1856
01:06:26,765 --> 01:06:29,285
with something easier so you can ask

1857
01:06:29,285 --> 01:06:31,055
as many questions ask for hints and

1858
01:06:31,055 --> 01:06:33,660
