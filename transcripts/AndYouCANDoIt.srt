115
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:28,860
pennies on the floor of the shop

116
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:31,383
nine hundred and ten hold one thousand

117
00:04:31,383 --> 00:04:32,700

120
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:38,070
and my theory yeah

121
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:40,980
and they were peanut shells and we

122
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:42,606
call them pennies my theory is that

123
00:04:42,606 --> 00:04:44,310
anyone can deposit them he was crazy

124
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:45,930
he must have gone to the bank

125
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:47,250
to do this but he but he

126
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:48,570
said he gathered up all the past

127
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:50,310
so many years that have been left

128
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:53,640
on his floor dumped them on the

129
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:56,220
guy's law how many could that be

130
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:59,040
i know i'm lying if he did

131
00:04:59,040 --> 00:04:59,280
that

132
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:00,750
and he dumped them on my lawn

133
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:02,430
i simply would go to the bank

134
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:04,920
and deposit that i would pick every

135
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,180
single penny i would pick up the

136
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,470
pennies and take them to the bank

137
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:08,850
well wait a minute how much do

138
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,710
you get coin star pie even to

139
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:12,120
babysit if you're on a private plane

140
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,370
um on a private plane you like

141
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:16,020
to take like nine is it is

142
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:17,100
it more than nine hundred and ten

143
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,240
dollars an hour because i think it

144
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,440
takes more than an hour to say

145
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,900
scoop those up ah on a p

146
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:22,290
j

147
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,110
when i was ok i would use

148
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:26,370
a copper magnet when i was getting

149
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:28,140
paid it's nowhere near that sound and

150
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:29,340
so if i took me one hour

151
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:30,360
to pick up nine hundred dollars i

152
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,700
would simply do that i was not

153
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,560
that long i wouldn't bend over once

154
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,000
to pick up hundred dollars

155
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:37,920
i don't know like nine hundred and

156
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,530
ten dollars in pennies if you can't

157
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:41,940

162
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,410

163
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:51,030

a break and you would not be

453
00:15:05,145 --> 00:15:05,655
grabbing the money

454
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:06,795

time and wasting your break you know

456
00:15:08,925 --> 00:15:09,825

pennington one after we watch paddington two

594

it's great i think i could do

597
00:19:58,365 --> 00:19:59,925
of course is i think you watch

598
00:19:59,925 --> 00:20:01,365
an order because i think you have

599
00:20:01,365 --> 00:20:02,625
to watch an order because everything has

600
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:04,455
to escalate in a sequel and if

601
00:20:04,455 --> 00:20:05,595
you watch it backwards you might go

602
00:20:05,595 --> 00:20:06,975

00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,270
of a skull this stuff that's underneath

00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,520
like this part of your flesh i

636
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,890
don't have that women ah

637
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:19,550
just have so many little faces that

638
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:21,530
are delicate and feminine and our faces

639
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:23,240
are just all cartilage we don't far

640
00:21:23,306 --> 00:21:24,230
we don't have bones

it i mean it was terrible there

643
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:31,580
were a couple of parts i bet

644
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,650
i bet i would find it i

645
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:36,020
find that revisiting any movie like like

646
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:37,790
that kind of movie is always a

647
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:39,350
little better than i remember it being

648
00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:41,240
yeah i guess because i'm prepared for

649
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,710
it this time although i watched ah

650
00:21:42,734 --> 00:21:45,410
star trek first key

651
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:47,720
contact the other day and it was

652
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,430
worse than i remembered it oh man

653
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:51,170
i think that's i think that's considered

654
00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:53,810
the best one it is i really

655
00:21:53,810 --> 00:21:54,620
like it was it was a little

656
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:56,570
slight after i watched it because mainly

657
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,039
because i've been watching so many episodes

658
00:21:58,039 --> 00:21:59,570
i thought was directed really well but

659
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,850

660
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:05,060

661
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:05,510

00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:43,640
in the avatar universe that really bothers

711
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,440
me that's what's so i don't have

712
00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:47,870

713
00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:50,060
hair create sperm

714
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:52,640

716
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:56,600

yeah avatar made silence of the lambs

720
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:05,150
silence of the levator or else it

721
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:06,350
gets the hose to get as a

722
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:07,400
thing that we say a lot in

723
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,810

724
00:24:08,810 --> 00:24:11,150

keeper and a wow we say it

727
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:17,270
very casually because anything begins with it

728
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:19,460
does this right we're talking about machinery

729
00:24:19,610 --> 00:24:21,410

focus on it as you're going to

1011
00:33:43,450 --> 00:33:45,700

1025
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:13,120
unfolding and with chapters with chapters with

1026
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:16,480
verses there's a bible there and a

1027

yeah i think they're pretty cool yeah

1047
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:03,700
they're great um but ah so legitimately

1048
00:35:03,970 --> 00:35:06,190
one hundred percent of the crowd was

1049
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:06,700
standing

1050
00:35:08,290 --> 00:35:11,020
and there were seats are there were

1051
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:12,730
not seats there were seats but every

1052
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,500
like a minute they came out everyone

1053
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:16,090
just rose to their feet with venue

1054
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:19,060
the ace where we perform many absolutely

1055
00:35:19,390 --> 00:35:21,190
are all stomping grounds that's right on

1056
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:22,330
sand the whole time we do our

1057
00:35:22,330 --> 00:35:24,310
show we don't either

1058
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:26,500
and i felt good i wish we

1059
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,240
were i always feel kind of bad

1060
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:30,610
for like standing up during a concert

1061
00:35:30,610 --> 00:35:31,900
because i'm tall and i go like

1062
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:32,890
oh i wonder if it's okay but

1063
00:35:32,890 --> 00:35:35,860
i was on the aisle and

1064
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:38,200
i think it's fine or whatever but

1065
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:40,000
yeah people will everyone standing when you

1066
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,620
get any religion and there's no way

1067
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:43,330
i can see if yes i stand

1068
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:44,680
how it goes that's the thing if

1069
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:46,570
if if it's spotty i will always

1070
00:35:46,570 --> 00:35:49,000
sit right and i also have a

1071
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,070
rule of concerts of like i don't

1072
00:35:51,070 --> 00:35:52,420
get mad at anyone for doing whatever

1073
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:53,860
they want because we're all there yeah

1074
00:35:53,890 --> 00:35:56,320
absolutely you know absolutely so i've been

1075
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,100
at concerts like

1076
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,110
we went to john legend one swear

1077
00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:01,570
some people were yelling at teens for

1078
00:36:01,570 --> 00:36:02,999
like dancing during the show so i

1079
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,020
think that's like a whole big sample

1080
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:06,521
it makes sense to john legend show

1081
00:36:06,610 --> 00:36:08,770
now sit down what are you even

1082
00:36:08,770 --> 00:36:10,990
doing here this is for us but

1083
00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:14,560
so three songs in i get this

1084
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:17,260
tap on my shoulder and

1085
00:36:17,290 --> 00:36:19,210
i turn around there's this like older

1086
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:22,180
long-haired grey haired hippie going do you

1087
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,430
mind moving over so i could see

1088
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:28,750
and i i i i think to

1089
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:30,760
myself what's going on i look behind

1090
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:32,860
and he's sitting down he's the only

1091
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:35,170
one in the higher class side yeah

1092
00:36:35,170 --> 00:36:36,280
and he's gonna able to see if

1093
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,990
you move over and so i go

1094
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:39,250
like like what he is that doesn't

1095
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:40,840
make any sense it by the way

1096
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,310
i was i was over a little

1097
00:36:42,310 --> 00:36:45,310
bit over like say the plane of

1098
00:36:45,310 --> 00:36:45,790
where i

1099
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:47,860
should be because otherwise i need to

1100
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:49,720
stand on a like bump for the

1101
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:51,423
aisle which was bump for them which

1102
00:36:51,441 --> 00:36:54,040
was uncomfortable that you had your reasons

1103
00:36:54,070 --> 00:36:55,810
because what does that mean the boom

1104
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:56,980
you know the but there's like a

1105
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:59,140
little bump of like a separation between

1106
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:00,610
the aisle and the where the seats

1107
00:37:00,610 --> 00:37:02,290
are does that make sense yeah where

1108
00:37:02,290 --> 00:37:04,720
the carpet is like rick carpenter yeah

1109
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:05,380
now i got you

1110
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:07,240
it was like a hard but yeah

1111
00:37:07,270 --> 00:37:08,527
if i were to stand here and

1112
00:37:08,527 --> 00:37:12,460
that now yeah you me but i

1113
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:14,950
went okay sure and i'm i tried

1114
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:17,710
to be accommodating i moved over um

1115
00:37:17,711 --> 00:37:19,240
and stood on the bump which is

1116
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:23,560
uncomfortable oh um tough and then during

1117
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:26,140
the two hit songs i suddenly

1118
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:28,930
they get shoved and i look behind

1119
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:31,270
me and this old hippie guy is

1120
00:37:31,270 --> 00:37:34,060
wildly maniacally dancing why

1121
00:37:35,890 --> 00:37:39,100
why from sitting down and being angry

1122
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:40,810
that he could barely see to the

1123
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:43,270
drugs kicked in i'd maybe be me

1124
00:37:43,270 --> 00:37:46,600
and i'm waiting for my shore and

1125
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:48,520
then when it means i'm going to

1126
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:50,380
hit you i'll tell you when i

1127
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:52,510
get up but until then get out

1128
00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:54,940
of my way and he's just flailing

1129
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:55,420
about

1130
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,980
and like with no and so then

1131
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:58,360
i was like with wild abandon with

1132
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,530
wild abandon and i was like oh

1133
00:37:59,530 --> 00:38:01,270
why was i feeling bad about this

1134
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:02,560
i just did what i wanted after

1135
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:03,910
that because if you're gonna first of

1136
00:38:03,910 --> 00:38:06,040
all if you're going to be crazy

1137
00:38:06,850 --> 00:38:08,920
i will say this yeah i don't

1138
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:11,560
like to stand at shows i don't

1139
00:38:11,830 --> 00:38:14,110
either but this was yeah it was

1140
00:38:14,110 --> 00:38:15,580
only ninety minutes but if everyone

1141
00:38:15,610 --> 00:38:17,440
stands you have to stand to see

1142
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:20,500
and spit sometimes like depending on where

1143
00:38:20,501 --> 00:38:21,430
it is i might take a little

1144
00:38:21,430 --> 00:38:22,630
break and just sit down there and

1145
00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:24,130

juliana i hope that's not the case

1361
00:46:27,490 --> 00:46:29,380
i had a dream two nights ago

1362
00:46:29,380 --> 00:46:31,630
that i was ah at someone's house

1363
00:46:31,630 --> 00:46:32,860
and i put on a belt and

1364
00:46:32,890 --> 00:46:34,493
like flew me into a chair and

1365
00:46:34,527 --> 00:46:36,100
i was like this is a haunted

1366
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:37,810
belt and i was like trying to

1367
00:46:37,870 --> 00:46:40,390
tell on you're trying to tell ball

1368
00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:40,960
like i was like

1369
00:46:41,230 --> 00:46:43,720
the belt just carried me over here

1370
00:46:43,780 --> 00:46:45,700
it was like haunted this is haunted

1371
00:46:46,180 --> 00:46:48,400
and then people were really busy because

1372
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:50,050
they were describing the menu of what

1373
00:46:50,050 --> 00:46:51,520
we're about to eat i think i

1374
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:52,030
have a hunter

1375
00:46:53,591 --> 00:46:55,420
i think i have a hunted bell

1376
00:46:55,425 --> 00:46:58,450
because it keeps not fitting oh well

1377
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:00,700
maybe it's like george clooney prank bell

1378
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:02,380
it'll fit one day and then like

1379
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:04,106
sixty days later it won't fit and

1380
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:05,950
that's crazy but that was just frank's

1381
00:47:05,950 --> 00:47:08,980
right yeah making things smaller taking the

1382
00:47:08,980 --> 00:47:10,570
wardrobe in an inch every whim that

1383
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:12,700
time to do that i don't know

1384
00:47:12,940 --> 00:47:13,330
i guess how

1385
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:14,950
does the wardrobe and the fact is

1386
00:47:14,950 --> 00:47:18,275

up before camping has to come up

1418
00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:35,290
before just because just the amount of

1419
00:48:35,290 --> 00:48:37,480
time we've spent talking yeah last time

1420
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:37,837
though you

1421
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:40,000
we're in a tent that was like

1422
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,250
on the ground how twenty years ago

1423
00:48:42,970 --> 00:48:44,500
so you were seventy

1424
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:47,680
so now you're thirty seven

1425
00:48:48,910 --> 00:48:50,230
but i just was saying because we

1426
00:48:50,230 --> 00:48:51,580
were in lake arrowhead and we were

1427
00:48:51,610 --> 00:48:53,380
in the forest and i was little

1428
00:48:53,380 --> 00:48:55,150
creeped out by it at first because

1429
00:48:55,150 --> 00:48:56,980
it was so quiet but then i

1430
00:48:56,980 --> 00:48:58,540
liked it but i was like i

1431
00:48:58,540 --> 00:48:59,590
said to my you know what i

1432
00:48:59,590 --> 00:49:00,490
don't want to i don't ever have

1433
00:49:00,490 --> 00:49:01,960
to go camping just see her where

1434
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:03,490
i never ever yeah yeah and then

1435
00:49:03,490 --> 00:49:05,890
he was like i don't like i'll

1436
00:49:05,890 --> 00:49:07,009
go with someone else like he's like

1437
00:49:07,510 --> 00:49:08,590
he's like i'd rather go with

1438
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:10,090
it was so inside because it's just

1439
00:49:10,090 --> 00:49:10,990
like you know go with a friend

1440
00:49:10,990 --> 00:49:12,580
who's excited yeah i don't want to

1441
00:49:12,580 --> 00:49:14,620
do that i have tried a couple

1442
00:49:14,620 --> 00:49:17,650
times when i was young it's really

1443
00:49:17,710 --> 00:49:19,360
like maybe i could have a little

1444
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:20,350
fun but i think i might get

1445
00:49:20,350 --> 00:49:22,360
a little too freaked out more than

1446
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:24,340
even more than the discomfort more than

1447
00:49:24,340 --> 00:49:25,570
the discomfort i think it's the sort

1448
00:49:25,570 --> 00:49:27,340
of like laying in the middle of

1449
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:29,130
the open that i don't like well

1450
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:32,200

00:49:40,420 --> 00:49:42,490

00:50:48,695 --> 00:50:50,525
feel like casey wilson has one yeah

1493
00:50:51,245 --> 00:50:53,945
um my dad built a clubhouse for

1494
00:50:53,945 --> 00:50:56,765
us which was essentially in the we

1495
00:50:56,765 --> 00:50:59,075
called it the alley but just in

1496
00:50:59,075 --> 00:50:59,915
the side

1497
00:51:00,335 --> 00:51:01,625
the side yard that didn't lead out

1498
00:51:01,625 --> 00:51:03,785
to anything where he's far wouldn't shit

1499
00:51:03,785 --> 00:51:06,215
but he he built like a clubhouse

1500
00:51:06,845 --> 00:51:09,245
which we then you know the only

1501
00:51:09,245 --> 00:51:10,535
time we would ever get together was

1502
00:51:10,535 --> 00:51:12,305
just about figuring out who was president

1503
00:51:12,305 --> 00:51:14,135
who was vice president who's treasurer and

1504
00:51:14,135 --> 00:51:15,875
who was skyler president of my club

1505
00:51:16,085 --> 00:51:17,885
we've talked i've been the treasurer yeah

1506
00:51:17,945 --> 00:51:19,775
our clubhouse was the basement and the

1507
00:51:19,775 --> 00:51:20,195
secretary

1508
00:51:20,195 --> 00:51:21,305
we have the worst job because you

1509
00:51:21,305 --> 00:51:22,745
never had any money so the treasurer

1510
00:51:22,745 --> 00:51:24,005
never had to do any although there

1511
00:51:24,005 --> 00:51:25,595
i think there were talks about like

1512
00:51:25,925 --> 00:51:28,145
okay out of our allowance forgot about

1513
00:51:28,145 --> 00:51:30,185
the shrug i was the secretary like

1514
00:51:30,185 --> 00:51:31,985
chip in money for something for our

1515
00:51:31,985 --> 00:51:33,905
allowance let's give ten percent of it

1516
00:51:33,905 --> 00:51:35,082
every week and then we can do

1517
00:51:35,082 --> 00:51:37,055
something fun absolutely we would do that

1518
00:51:37,055 --> 00:51:39,215
attention to where it was like and

1519
00:51:39,215 --> 00:51:40,325
we did it a few times

1520
00:51:40,415 --> 00:51:41,585
it was like hey put ten percent

1521
00:51:41,585 --> 00:51:42,515
of your tips in here and we'll

1522
00:51:42,515 --> 00:51:44,435

wow like it wasn't it was more

1537
00:52:11,855 --> 00:52:13,175

1540
00:52:15,155 --> 00:52:17,525
of effort yeah i was on student

1541
00:52:17,525 --> 00:52:17,945

1542
00:52:19,175 --> 00:52:20,585

00:52:35,615 --> 00:52:36,635
ha kind of show but

1550
00:52:37,775 --> 00:52:41,795
um but what i noticed was everyone

1551
00:52:41,825 --> 00:52:43,565
put so much effort into doing these

1552
00:52:43,565 --> 00:52:45,725
super long banners that they would decorate

1553
00:52:45,725 --> 00:52:48,605
with paint and yeah and you're i

1554
00:52:48,605 --> 00:52:50,945
never would go to them because they

1555
00:52:50,945 --> 00:52:53,285
weren't it was always just like okay

1556
00:52:53,285 --> 00:52:55,325
whatever like you would eventually yeah they're

1557
00:52:55,325 --> 00:52:56,735
too hungry and eventually your eye would

1558
00:52:56,735 --> 00:52:57,875
gloss over because ever

1559
00:52:57,875 --> 00:52:59,345
no one was doing them yeah so

1560
00:52:59,345 --> 00:53:02,945
all i did was i xerox hundreds

1561
00:53:02,945 --> 00:53:04,715
if not thousands of just if a

1562
00:53:04,715 --> 00:53:07,415
million sheets if not hundreds of millions

1563
00:53:07,685 --> 00:53:11,105
if not just sheets of paper that

1564
00:53:11,105 --> 00:53:13,565

is all over the school and it

1567
00:53:20,405 --> 00:53:23,105
was really eye popping and eyecatching and

1568
00:53:23,105 --> 00:53:25,265
everyone was like like paid attention to

1569
00:53:25,265 --> 00:53:26,945

1570
00:53:26,945 --> 00:53:28,295

i knew it sounded like that what

1573
00:53:33,815 --> 00:53:36,125
if he really had achieved such heights

1574
00:53:36,185 --> 00:53:38,045
as you designed for him

1575
00:53:38,285 --> 00:53:39,305
and he was the first student council

1576
00:53:39,305 --> 00:53:40,535
president on mount rushmore

1577
00:53:41,675 --> 00:53:43,445

1580
00:53:47,124 --> 00:53:49,295

1581
00:53:49,355 --> 00:53:50,825

1584
00:53:55,895 --> 00:53:57,875
right before covert we had a whole

1585
00:53:57,875 --> 00:54:00,845
trip planned that you guys were supposed

1586
00:54:00,845 --> 00:54:01,235
to come to

1587
00:54:01,685 --> 00:54:04,445
in montana we were oh yeah where

1588
00:54:04,445 --> 00:54:05,675
we were going to and it was

1589
00:54:05,675 --> 00:54:07,715
sort of like glamping but you got

1590
00:54:07,745 --> 00:54:09,185
yeah yeah and so we just didn't

1591
00:54:09,185 --> 00:54:10,085
