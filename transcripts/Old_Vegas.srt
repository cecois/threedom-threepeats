53
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,110
a show that i think the look

54
00:01:58,110 --> 00:01:58,800
of it was

55
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:03,180
as it was a ah a regular

56
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:06,330
old white girl loves the jew oh

57
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:09,720
nah earth how did that happen i

58
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,980
think that was the hook like she

59
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:13,773
was either protestant or catholic weird and

60
00:02:13,793 --> 00:02:15,180
she was dating a jewish guy so

61
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:17,100
you know we are any weird premises

62
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:18,450
for dvd tv shows i went down

63
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:18,960
the rabbit hole

64
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,070
all of like i was you know

65
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:21,540
i've stayed kind of away from the

00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:23,160
info about it like i know it

67
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,690
as a cultural reference but amos and

68
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:26,430
andy i was like boy i was

69
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:27,660
like i got i gotta figure out

70
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:30,000
exactly what happened with this like one

71
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,440
day i was just like enough being

72
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,790
in the dark about the ins and

73
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:34,260
the outs is there any way for

74
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:36,030
deemed what is no i wasn't that

75
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:38,160
but but i was an andy yeah

76
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:38,850
i don't think i know what that

77
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:39,120
is

78
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:40,770
it was a it was a radio

79
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:45,960
program ah whereupon the actors ah who

80
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:47,490
were and and i believe the writers

81
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:50,280
who are white ah portrayed ah people

82
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,680
who were black oh and ah when

83
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,260
i found actually interesting about the story

84
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:56,880
is that by the time it became

85
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,280
a tv show people were like

86
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,567
like thought it wasn't right and they

87
00:03:01,567 --> 00:03:04,020
said blackface on tv they started with

88
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:05,760
blackface on tv and then they realised

89
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,470
that wasn't going to fly and so

90
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:09,510
then they cast the cast black actors

91
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:11,250
in it and then people were upset

92
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:12,660
that it wasn't the voices that they'd

93
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:13,830
come to know and love on the

94
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:15,150
radio and so the whole thing just

95
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:16,650
kind of fell apart so that the

96
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,960
voices are insane too it's like it's

97
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,440
a craig

98
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,500
easy caricature it's horrible right but i

99
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,170
was i was glad i just assumed

100
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:26,610
that it was on for years and

101
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:27,990
it was popular and everyone loved it

102
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,640
but i was i was interested to

103
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,960
learn that by the time it came

104
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,910
on tv people were like the this

105
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:34,230
should not be happening that's curtly and

106
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:35,850
so it was not so that was

107
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:36,750
the part of the story that i

108
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:38,100
thought it had a happy ending as

109
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:39,600
it was cancelled and now

110
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,440

111
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:47,130

00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:56,050
your post questions like this went nowhere

516
00:19:56,050 --> 00:19:58,240

00:19:58,270 --> 00:20:00,490
would you do this i training acts

518
00:20:00,673 --> 00:20:02,680
certain people would start to justify the

519
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,630
behavior but you also said somebody could

520
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:06,640
buy your birthday for a thousand dollars

521
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:09,520
yes please i don't need it but

522
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,260
your birthday i want to ask you

523
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:12,430
a question too based on a previous

524
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:13,330
episode alright

525
00:20:14,065 --> 00:20:15,830
me lauren bradley receipt

526
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:19,580
if i would just give you twenty

527
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:21,320
bucks for no reason yeah yeah would

528
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,188
you give me twenty bucks for no

529
00:20:22,188 --> 00:20:24,524
reason sure you really yeah if it

530
00:20:24,524 --> 00:20:26,390
was like kinda twenty bucks you just

531
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:27,758
go here and i would note episode

532
00:20:27,758 --> 00:20:29,000
you wouldn't even have to say like

533
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,590
i needed yeah of course

534
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:33,677
i would do that to yeah i

535
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:35,240
would give it to you but i'd

536
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:37,550
really wonder why you want it because

537
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:39,980
in normal human interaction you would say

538
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,360
hey do you have twenty dollars that

539
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:44,480
i can have because this thing you

540
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,550
wouldn't just say i want two dollars

541
00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:48,080
yeah i want to kind of clarify

542
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,270
because i i when we talked about

543
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:51,770
it it was very telling

544
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:54,440
you you i think you thought there

545
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,910
was some big message there that i

546
00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:57,320
wouldn't just give you twenty dollars yeah

547
00:20:57,650 --> 00:20:59,420
i would give a homeless person twenty

548
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:00,620
dollars before i would give you twenty

549
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:03,350
dollars why because i know you have

550
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:05,000
twenty dollars no i don't i need

551
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,460
twenty dollars if you weren't like i

552
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:08,510
want i just want to make clear

553
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:09,770
my point is not that i am

554
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:11,210
so stingy that would never give anyone

555
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:11,810
twenty dollars

556
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:13,880

642
00:24:12,319 --> 00:24:13,280
strange that if i were to come

643
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,420

644
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:16,130

why

648
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:22,760
if kevin said hey do you have

649
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:24,890
twenty dollars that's weird i'd actually probably

650
00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:25,880
give it to him without as many

651
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:28,220
questions as with you with me you

652
00:24:28,610 --> 00:24:30,080
i just went for i don't have

653
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,130
twenty dollars i don't think he's going

654
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:32,420
to spend on that here's the thing

655
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,910
he needs that i'm telling you i'm

656
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:36,650
telling you a cation this is why

657
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:38,000

659
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,640
want twenty dollars that is

660
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:43,040
why it's weird but why is that

661
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:45,860
strange that was don't you want twenty

662
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:48,380
dollar no because i would rather have

663
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:50,060

00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:52,190

670
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:05,510
if somebody who needs money and is

671
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:07,340

but it's also kind of it was

710
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:33,290
also kind of serious right that you're

711
00:26:33,290 --> 00:26:35,990
straddling the line between drama is what

712
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:38,510
i do this is why the art

00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:41,240
of what i'm doing that's right that's

714
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:44,390
why i'm different um i said like

715
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:46,910
most people i keep a running list

716
00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:47,840
in my head

717
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,510
head of people that i don't know

718
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:53,300
if they like me or despise me

719
00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:55,160
right and then laura and i started

720
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,510
talking about it on text and i

721
00:26:56,510 --> 00:26:58,490

du no no no but i did

725
00:27:04,610 --> 00:27:06,170
i did follow up and say who

726
00:27:06,170 --> 00:27:07,790

727
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:08,000

i actually wrote them down and i

729
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:11,300
was gonna do mine but then i

730
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:12,470
feared it would be too long because

731
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:15,440
i ah i always think that somebody

732
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,850
hates me or something everywhere i go

733
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:18,470
well i was great mine was gonna

734
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:19,460
be too long and then i realized

735
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:20,870
well there's some people that i don't

736
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:22,250
i don't know but i don't care

737
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:24,740
about so much there's there's people on

738
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:26,510
the list that i showed you that

739
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:28,088
i don't necessarily

740
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:30,470
like them but i don't know what

741
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:31,850
you don't and i live in them

742
00:27:31,954 --> 00:27:34,580
not like i think that's usually the

743
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:37,190
basis like if you really investigate you

744
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:38,720
go maybe i have a problem or

745
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,400
something and that's why i think this

746
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,930
person doesn't love never come to that

747
00:27:41,930 --> 00:27:43,520
conclusion it's the same thing it's like

748
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,660
when you like the faults you see

749
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:46,280
in other people or problems with yourself

750
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,810
or something it's like you're going like

751
00:27:48,425 --> 00:27:49,820
this person is like me because i'm

752
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:50,840

754
00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:55,368
but i'm like a friendly guy and

755
00:27:55,368 --> 00:27:56,570
i don't see i don't think i

756
00:27:56,570 --> 00:27:59,150
put that energy out to these people

757
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:01,283
friendly as casper the ghost himself yeah

758
00:28:01,283 --> 00:28:02,030

i just don't understand that well okay

802
00:29:18,710 --> 00:29:20,450
we'll have to because because this person

803
00:29:20,450 --> 00:29:22,520
is extremely hard to read shane the

804
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:24,560
one that i said he is actually

805
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:25,280
cut my cum off the

806
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,240
way to a lot of people because

807
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,100
yeah it seems like that doesn't really

808
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,810
outwardly show a lot of affection that

809
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:31,070
was that came up in the hawaii

810
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:32,630
trip we talked about this person who

811
00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:33,740
is by the way a person that

812
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:36,800
i do like a lot um and

813
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:39,200
i was relieved that other other people

814
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:41,750
had the same feeling and essentially saying

815
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:44,000
nobody knows you nobody knows for sure

816
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:45,020
yeah and i was like ok i

817
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:45,440
feel better

818
00:29:45,466 --> 00:29:47,480
now that it's not just me yeah

819
00:29:47,690 --> 00:29:48,590

820
00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:49,790
lot where people go like i don't

821
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:50,900

823
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:52,730

you sit down for your player i

829
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:08,390
think about every single person and i

830
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:11,780
think positive thoughts about them it's such

831
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:13,700
a weird thing to be on the

832
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:16,880
earth for what feels like well an

833
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,400
eternity you're well when you're you're you're

834
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:19,520
all

835
00:30:20,125 --> 00:30:22,615
you're ever have ever felt right and

836
00:30:22,615 --> 00:30:23,995
you are you're always like they might

837
00:30:23,995 --> 00:30:26,065
be dialed yeah exactly my giants don't

838
00:30:26,065 --> 00:30:27,685
eat this pot cookie older than you've

839
00:30:27,685 --> 00:30:30,085
ever been and now you're getting older

840
00:30:30,175 --> 00:30:32,245
now you're even but that the the

841
00:30:32,245 --> 00:30:34,885
shift that stays the insecurities that stay

842
00:30:34,885 --> 00:30:37,975
with you that you think all be

843
00:30:37,975 --> 00:30:38,995
done with that by the time i'm

844
00:30:38,995 --> 00:30:40,285
that age certainly

845
00:30:40,345 --> 00:30:42,565
i'm realising that life is short and

846
00:30:42,565 --> 00:30:44,245
why would i bother caring about such

847
00:30:44,245 --> 00:30:45,985
a thing you don't care as much

848
00:30:45,985 --> 00:30:48,055
but you do you do think about

849
00:30:48,055 --> 00:30:49,315
these so you can't control your thoughts

850
00:30:49,465 --> 00:30:51,505
but it's not like i'm definitely not

851
00:30:51,505 --> 00:30:53,335

for a while when you're the boss

881
00:31:46,015 --> 00:31:49,525
of something it's like just one unending

882
00:31:49,525 --> 00:31:51,685
fight with people yet to get to

883
00:31:51,685 --> 00:31:53,485

884
00:31:53,485 --> 00:31:55,525
show or the project whatever you're doing

885
00:31:55,525 --> 00:31:58,105
is just like you're constantly being told

886
00:31:58,105 --> 00:31:59,215
we can't do this we can't do

887
00:31:59,215 --> 00:32:00,265

00:32:00,265 --> 00:32:01,345
saying like but we need to do

this we need to do this so

890
00:32:02,586 --> 00:32:04,075
like all that stuff kind of goes

891
00:32:04,075 --> 00:32:04,765
out the window at

892
00:32:04,765 --> 00:32:06,115
a certain point where you're just like

893
00:32:06,325 --> 00:32:07,885
we have a business relationship and i

894
00:32:07,885 --> 00:32:09,115
don't care if you like me or

896
00:32:11,245 --> 00:32:12,985
about getting the the end result done

897
00:32:12,985 --> 00:32:13,975
and yes we all want to be

898
00:32:13,975 --> 00:32:15,325
pleasant to each other but we're here

899
00:32:15,325 --> 00:32:17,905
for a purpose never going from never

900
00:32:17,905 --> 00:32:19,285
being a boss to suddenly being a

901
00:32:19,285 --> 00:32:21,265

somebody this isn't right or this needs

913
00:32:44,485 --> 00:32:46,495
to be different or whatever it just

914
00:32:46,495 --> 00:32:49,465

the time because you want because you

923
00:33:06,085 --> 00:33:08,545
want to achieve good greatness or whatever

924
00:33:08,755 --> 00:33:10,285
and i'm not saying that you like

925
00:33:10,765 --> 00:33:12,325
like i flip out and yell at

926
00:33:12,325 --> 00:33:14,035
people because that's not good you know

927
00:33:14,035 --> 00:33:15,325
to be but i'm just saying like

928
00:33:15,805 --> 00:33:18,055
i have a constant feeling like i

929
00:33:18,055 --> 00:33:20,695
am difficult to people because i'm saying

930
00:33:20,695 --> 00:33:22,255
like because i'm saying like hey can

931
00:33:22,255 --> 00:33:24,115
we do this better can we can

932
00:33:24,115 --> 00:33:26,245
we yeah it's just to drag it

933
00:33:26,245 --> 00:33:28,045
becomes a drag on like i feel

934
00:33:28,045 --> 00:33:29,035
like i get home at the end

935
00:33:29,035 --> 00:33:30,355
of the day i'm just like oh

936
00:33:30,355 --> 00:33:30,895
god i

937
00:33:30,925 --> 00:33:32,995
just want to be like feel normal

938
00:33:33,265 --> 00:33:34,945
and have like a normal interaction with

939
00:33:34,945 --> 00:33:36,175
someone where i'm not you when the

940
00:33:36,175 --> 00:33:37,645
reality is like when you have been

941
00:33:37,645 --> 00:33:39,655
an employee of someone in a creative

942
00:33:39,715 --> 00:33:42,325
endeavor and they've asked you for changes

943
00:33:42,325 --> 00:33:44,485
you're not thinking oh my god this

944
00:33:44,485 --> 00:33:47,095
guy is insane why is he never

945
00:33:47,095 --> 00:33:49,045
shuts up you know it's like no

946
00:33:49,045 --> 00:33:50,155
this part of the job i get

947
00:33:50,155 --> 00:33:51,085
it you know it's all

948
00:33:51,085 --> 00:33:53,755
so because you're dealing with your someone

949
00:33:53,755 --> 00:33:55,555
has an idea in their head that

950
00:33:55,555 --> 00:33:57,025
they are trying to make a real

951
00:33:57,025 --> 00:33:59,095
thing yeah right and so that requires

952
00:33:59,095 --> 00:34:02,035
a certain amount of translating and it's

953
00:34:02,035 --> 00:34:03,415
not going to be right out of

954
00:34:03,415 --> 00:34:04,915
the box the first time i also

955
00:34:04,915 --> 00:34:06,355
want to process if it has something

956
00:34:06,355 --> 00:34:07,675
to do with the very nature of

957
00:34:07,675 --> 00:34:11,245
art where people are bringing you know

958
00:34:11,245 --> 00:34:12,565
no like if you're if you're working

959
00:34:12,565 --> 00:34:13,615
at a job where i don't know

960
00:34:13,615 --> 00:34:15,895
where you have to have numbers or

961
00:34:15,895 --> 00:34:17,485
something that the numbers are there the

962
00:34:17,485 --> 00:34:19,315
data is there it's it's i need

963
00:34:19,315 --> 00:34:21,025
those numbers we have to have them

964
00:34:22,285 --> 00:34:23,815
but when it's art it's like someone's

965
00:34:23,815 --> 00:34:25,195
coming to you with their vision and

966
00:34:25,195 --> 00:34:27,115
you're saying oh but actually i would

967
00:34:27,115 --> 00:34:28,645
rather be this and you feel like

968
00:34:28,645 --> 00:34:30,265
you're disappointing them because they came to

969
00:34:30,265 --> 00:34:32,275
you yeah lauren you seem like you're

970
00:34:32,275 --> 00:34:33,985
zoning out or looking at the tv

971
00:34:33,985 --> 00:34:36,145
what's going oh well i did glance

972
00:34:36,145 --> 00:34:37,675
at the stop watch behind your head

973
00:34:37,705 --> 00:34:40,285
um but i wasn't well you're talking

974
00:34:41,395 --> 00:34:42,205
praying for

975
00:34:42,415 --> 00:34:45,235
time to speed up guys why

976
00:34:46,395 --> 00:34:48,565
eternity i'm gonna do that all the

977
00:34:48,565 --> 00:34:52,405
time i was interested um was is

978
00:34:52,405 --> 00:34:54,355
the operative i don't really think i've

979
00:34:54,355 --> 00:34:56,365
ever really been a boss i i

980
00:34:56,425 --> 00:34:57,445
you were sort of in charge of

981
00:34:57,445 --> 00:34:59,815
your characters episode yeah yeah i definitely

982
00:34:59,815 --> 00:35:00,985
definitely but like there were a lot

983
00:35:00,985 --> 00:35:02,875
of other people certainly enjoyed the special

984
00:35:02,875 --> 00:35:03,265
thanks

985
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:07,765
which i understand if people understood and

986
00:35:07,825 --> 00:35:09,565
like working together on all of those

987
00:35:09,565 --> 00:35:10,915
too like i got to like yeah

988
00:35:10,945 --> 00:35:12,865
dictate certain elements of it and choose

989
00:35:12,865 --> 00:35:14,425
a lot of things but then you

990
00:35:14,425 --> 00:35:16,105
know like other things i wasn't in

991
00:35:16,105 --> 00:35:17,905
control like it wasn't the director so

992
00:35:17,905 --> 00:35:20,485
then like that immediately changes a bit

993
00:35:20,485 --> 00:35:22,435
of the perspective because there's another person

994
00:35:22,435 --> 00:35:24,445
who's deciding how things so

995
00:35:24,715 --> 00:35:26,965
so then but like i directed a

996
00:35:26,965 --> 00:35:29,050
short film in the fall yes so

997
00:35:29,065 --> 00:35:30,415
one was really send it to me

998
00:35:30,445 --> 00:35:31,615
and i still have never don't watch

999
00:35:31,615 --> 00:35:32,547
that one because i'm getting a new

1000
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:34,735
ex really watching so um your laziness

1001
00:35:35,155 --> 00:35:37,915
oh yes my watch the old lazy

1002
00:35:37,945 --> 00:35:39,175
oh yeah well there's a new one

1003
00:35:39,205 --> 00:35:40,255
it's gonna be much better i hope

1004
00:35:40,255 --> 00:35:43,255
so because there's okay i well you

1005
00:35:43,585 --> 00:35:44,605
do next you not

1006
00:35:44,635 --> 00:35:47,032
me but it was hammy so jovial

1007
00:35:47,035 --> 00:35:49,015
i'm wear my goggles because of how

1008
00:35:49,015 --> 00:35:51,115
he's dressed yeah it does a lot

1009
00:35:51,625 --> 00:35:55,465
for topic battens fire ah i just

1010
00:35:55,495 --> 00:35:57,355
i did feel there was a different

1011
00:35:57,505 --> 00:36:00,595
sense of pressure being the director of

1012
00:36:00,595 --> 00:36:02,035
the day we did all one day

1013
00:36:02,035 --> 00:36:03,415
but that do you feel like that

1014
00:36:03,415 --> 00:36:04,495
pressure is pushing down on you

1015
00:36:05,065 --> 00:36:07,465
yeah pressure can be um any linux

1016
00:36:07,465 --> 00:36:09,625
and hear about like but not great

1017
00:36:09,625 --> 00:36:11,844
at first kind of phone in for

1018
00:36:11,844 --> 00:36:14,755
a little bit ah i liked it

1019
00:36:14,755 --> 00:36:16,615
a lot i liked being able to

1020
00:36:16,855 --> 00:36:18,955
control elements that i normally as an

1021
00:36:18,955 --> 00:36:20,125
actor don't get to control but i

1022
00:36:20,155 --> 00:36:23,545
also was realising just how much work

1023
00:36:23,545 --> 00:36:24,925
goes onto that sidewalks just

1024
00:36:24,955 --> 00:36:26,995
like every single question is directed towards

1025
00:36:26,995 --> 00:36:29,755
me and then yeah everyone needs information

1026
00:36:29,755 --> 00:36:31,438
and you're the only person with the

1027
00:36:31,438 --> 00:36:34,525
information and you can spend the entire

1028
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:37,345
day answering questions or you can make

1029
00:36:37,345 --> 00:36:38,785
the thing right you know what i

1030
00:36:38,785 --> 00:36:40,585
mean and hope that you know some

1031
00:36:40,585 --> 00:36:42,415
of it gets delegated and yeah just

1032
00:36:42,415 --> 00:36:44,545
like people can work themselves yeah i

1033
00:36:44,545 --> 00:36:45,085
was thinking

1034
00:36:45,085 --> 00:36:46,315
well that i had a crew of

1035
00:36:46,315 --> 00:36:48,175
people who were like really independent like

1036
00:36:48,175 --> 00:36:49,315
they were able to come up with

1037
00:36:49,315 --> 00:36:51,265
their own thoughts and ideas too like

1038
00:36:51,265 --> 00:36:53,245
moving forward so that it wasn't just

1039
00:36:53,245 --> 00:36:54,775
me going yuck here's what has to

1040
00:36:54,775 --> 00:36:56,935
happen but um it just gave me

1041
00:36:56,935 --> 00:37:01,495
a newfound um appreciation for the role

1042
00:37:01,585 --> 00:37:03,955
of director well i hope you get

1043
00:37:03,955 --> 00:37:05,125
to do more of it because from

1044
00:37:05,125 --> 00:37:05,245
what

1045
00:37:05,245 --> 00:37:08,005
i've heard about this short it's fantastic

1046
00:37:08,035 --> 00:37:10,525

1053
00:37:23,725 --> 00:37:25,345
is another element that's a little different

1054
00:37:25,405 --> 00:37:27,955

like he can just talk and it

1128
00:39:58,045 --> 00:39:59,965

1140
00:40:21,530 --> 00:40:22,790
two at a time when to play

1141
00:40:22,790 --> 00:40:23,720
with succour

1142
00:40:26,990 --> 00:40:29,210
i had an experience recently where i

1143
00:40:29,210 --> 00:40:32,600
was doing something where i was direct

1144
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,520
being directed in a character that i

1145
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:36,620
had done for many years oh yeah

1146
00:40:36,950 --> 00:40:39,080
and by new person i never met

1147
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:41,600
before and did not know was going

1148
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,880
to be directing me oh okay so

1149
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:45,020
i had to adjust on the fly

1150
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:46,700
lie of like the the thing i

1151
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:48,020
try to like there was a time

1152
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:49,880
when i would have been very insulted

1153
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,620
by that and very upset and like

1154
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:53,540
would have felt like i'm supposed to

1155
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:54,680
say something i should say something this

1156
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:56,060
person and i'm gonna let it really

1157
00:40:56,060 --> 00:40:58,100
annoy me and it was annoying but

been nominated for an oscar even wins

1190
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:11,840
an oscar undoubtedly their next thing is

1191
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:13,610
not going to be as good right

1192
00:42:13,610 --> 00:42:15,677
but like there's so few tom hanks

1193
00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:17,000
who went back to back but don't

1194
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,174
you think like what the shit hunger

ever be able to top

1198
00:42:25,850 --> 00:42:27,530
what they just did that's when you

1199
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:31,400
pivot and you do another hobby another

1200
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:34,430

something else that's challenging must be very

1202
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:38,360
rewarding i just feel like it must

1203
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:40,100
be very difficult to have achieved that

1204
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:43,580
kind of success of like winning an

1205
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:45,590

what one of every hotel you went

1251
00:44:15,230 --> 00:44:16,880
to you call down to ask for

1252
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:19,340
my i'm feeling brand-new for i forgot

1253
00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:20,300
to tobacco what could you bring me

1254
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:22,400
a bible bible and every hotel i

1255
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:24,260
mean there's no no certain shows like

1256
00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:27,170
the the marriott chain they do really

1257
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:28,310
yeah hotel i just sit in that

1258
00:44:28,310 --> 00:44:29,930
i don't think as a chain had

1259
00:44:29,930 --> 00:44:31,850
it it's such a strange point of

1260
00:44:31,850 --> 00:44:33,260
view of that well if you're

1261
00:44:33,290 --> 00:44:35,690
staying in a hotel you must be

1262
00:44:35,690 --> 00:44:37,100
at one of the low points of

1263
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:39,350
your life you could be that's how

1264
00:44:39,410 --> 00:44:41,450
there's the temptations you've strayed from home

1265
00:44:41,810 --> 00:44:43,820
yes temptations arise we see it it's

1266
00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:45,800
like here's a general book a lot

1267
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:48,290
of people like like somebody like michael

1268
00:44:48,290 --> 00:44:50,450
crighton they're just like the bible know

1269
00:44:50,450 --> 00:44:53,420
no fear that the the religions

1270
00:44:53,450 --> 00:44:55,070
actually put them in there the hotels

1271
00:44:55,070 --> 00:44:57,260
don't the the religion oh the hotels

1272
00:44:57,260 --> 00:45:00,020
do because the maria chains on by

1273
00:45:00,050 --> 00:45:02,120
mitt romney's family oh i didn't know

1274
00:45:02,135 --> 00:45:03,590
they put bibles in every i don't

1275
00:45:03,620 --> 00:45:04,970
like why don't they put book of

1276
00:45:04,970 --> 00:45:07,280
mormon in there too on the nose

1277
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:09,440
so much troops religious texts you could

1278
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:10,520
be throwing in there and be it'd

1279
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:11,870
be much more interesting to open your

1280
00:45:12,410 --> 00:45:13,520
table and see a

1281
00:45:13,610 --> 00:45:15,380
koran but but what is the point

1282
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:16,460
of view behind it because i always

1283
00:45:16,460 --> 00:45:18,380
assumed it was not forgotten i was

1284
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:20,060
assumed it was like let's let's get

1285
00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:21,320
these people when they're at their low

1286
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:22,790
point it's not just like hey if

1287
00:45:22,790 --> 00:45:24,440
you're bored check this out i think

1288
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:25,850
it does come from a tradition of

1289
00:45:25,850 --> 00:45:28,160
that of where we used to be

1290
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:29,780
back in the fifties or whatever yeah

1291
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:32,030
we're at a hotel if you're traveling

1292
00:45:32,030 --> 00:45:33,740
if you're traveling subject to it's like

1293
00:45:33,740 --> 00:45:35,600
like say maybe don't shoot junior ever

1294
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:37,730
get shit faced drunk man it feels

1295
00:45:37,730 --> 00:45:39,920
so fifty is to like think that

1296
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:42,590
like that's so like a black and

1297
00:45:42,590 --> 00:45:44,900

1298
00:45:44,900 --> 00:45:47,000
where the guys sam raimi sam raimi

1299
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:50,900

1306
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:03,950
what i mean is like it's not

1307
00:46:03,950 --> 00:46:05,750
really a packable now especially when you

1308
00:46:05,750 --> 00:46:07,370

colonel potter i always turned the channel

1320
00:46:34,970 --> 00:46:36,770
when that show came i know that's

1321
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:40,670
that's your generation because it's animation um

1322
00:46:40,670 --> 00:46:42,231
it's too brown it's definitely dusty it's

1323
00:46:42,231 --> 00:46:44,000
a dusty show i don't believe there's

1324
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,970
humor there um so here's how the

1325
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:48,830

1335
00:47:03,860 --> 00:47:08,030
mansion apartments lupus jack quite a difference

1336
00:47:08,030 --> 00:47:10,340
