270
00:10:21,105 --> 00:10:22,695
was like really so much used to

271
00:10:22,695 --> 00:10:24,975
television show and people watch it i

272
00:10:24,975 --> 00:10:26,415
just was like this seems like it's

273
00:10:26,415 --> 00:10:28,515
not for adults like i was confused

274
00:10:28,515 --> 00:10:28,755
by

275
00:10:28,815 --> 00:10:30,315
my brother was really intuitive mike was

276
00:10:30,315 --> 00:10:32,025
really into it and then i watched

277
00:10:32,025 --> 00:10:33,552
it and i really liked it yeah

278
00:10:33,912 --> 00:10:35,325
just really well done yeah but i

279
00:10:35,325 --> 00:10:37,155
was really surprised by that like so

280
00:10:37,155 --> 00:10:38,325
it was an example of one of

281
00:10:38,325 --> 00:10:41,355
the sequels that i thought did a

282
00:10:41,355 --> 00:10:43,965
good job yeah but i think there

283
00:10:43,965 --> 00:10:45,285
are a couple of the spielberg canon

284
00:10:45,285 --> 00:10:48,435
like um close encounters yeah what what

285
00:10:48,465 --> 00:10:48,945
operate

286
00:10:48,975 --> 00:10:50,355
so like what them with that guy

287
00:10:50,385 --> 00:10:52,275

00:10:52,275 --> 00:10:54,645
of the questions answered you know and

289
00:10:54,645 --> 00:10:55,905
and the whole point of that movie

290
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:58,575
is like oh holy shit like there's

291
00:10:58,575 --> 00:11:00,885
probably life out there and outer space

292
00:11:00,885 --> 00:11:02,235
and we all heal we all wanna

293
00:11:02,235 --> 00:11:03,585

294
00:11:03,585 --> 00:11:04,785

295
00:11:05,685 --> 00:11:07,635

588
00:21:08,285 --> 00:21:10,745

out of stuff to say i'm sorry

659
00:23:45,035 --> 00:23:46,625
i want to do a segway thought

660
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:48,482
something would come up with bobby real

661
00:23:48,482 --> 00:23:50,105
just had what i would consider a

662
00:23:50,105 --> 00:23:52,115
string of a bunch of new stories

663
00:23:52,625 --> 00:23:53,525
and then you killed it

664
00:23:54,695 --> 00:23:58,925
ah you segue to nothing sorry but

665
00:23:58,925 --> 00:24:00,665
i thought it would be there and

666
00:24:00,845 --> 00:24:02,255
just kind of handed did you did

667
00:24:02,255 --> 00:24:03,245
you think you were gonna come up

668
00:24:03,245 --> 00:24:04,475
with something you thought someone else would

669
00:24:04,475 --> 00:24:05,675
fill the void well i thought you

670
00:24:05,675 --> 00:24:07,175
guys would interrupt me like you normally

671
00:24:07,175 --> 00:24:08,465
do and i wouldn't have to say

672
00:24:08,465 --> 00:24:09,696
anything no but i just want to

673
00:24:09,696 --> 00:24:12,275
feel that we only read lauren oh

674
00:24:12,275 --> 00:24:14,525

00:25:28,115 --> 00:25:30,515
i'm going to for some reason i

709
00:25:30,545 --> 00:25:32,405

whole show i didn't know i was

807
00:29:05,915 --> 00:29:09,245
pregnant right you'd have to be so

808
00:29:09,305 --> 00:29:11,345
out of touch i think if your

00:29:11,345 --> 00:29:13,968
body into you have no i don't

810
00:29:13,968 --> 00:29:14,285
why

811
00:29:14,285 --> 00:29:15,935
oh just denial about what was happening

812
00:29:15,935 --> 00:29:19,385
maybe i'll just finger bargaining name acceptance

813
00:29:19,685 --> 00:29:21,755
to depression to get through the point

814
00:29:21,755 --> 00:29:24,005
where you remember giving birth i could

815
00:29:24,005 --> 00:29:25,865
imagine remember i mean i know people

816
00:29:25,865 --> 00:29:27,245
who didn't know for like the first

817
00:29:27,245 --> 00:29:29,105
few months but to get to the

818
00:29:29,105 --> 00:29:32,195
point where you were in labor and

819
00:29:32,195 --> 00:29:34,115
you had no idea i'm like whoa

820
00:29:34,175 --> 00:29:34,445
fir

821
00:29:34,445 --> 00:29:35,847
first of all what the fuck because

822
00:29:35,847 --> 00:29:37,325
you were like they started talking about

823
00:29:37,325 --> 00:29:39,695
it like my friend was like well

824
00:29:39,695 --> 00:29:42,515
we both gained weight we you suddenly

825
00:29:42,545 --> 00:29:44,525
your period stopped her name i don't

826
00:29:44,525 --> 00:29:46,835

to do with that movie and the

946
00:33:54,585 --> 00:33:55,930
whole point of it is just that

947
00:33:55,930 --> 00:33:58,455
the dog dies what is the story

948
00:33:58,455 --> 00:34:00,615
of illegal yeah isn't it like marley

00:34:18,345 --> 00:34:20,745
should have special powers to like zastava

958
00:34:20,785 --> 00:34:21,915
i mean yeah there are dogs who

959
00:34:21,915 --> 00:34:23,617
bark a lot when i say there's

960
00:34:23,625 --> 00:34:25,515
nothing like my dog has some special

961
00:34:25,575 --> 00:34:28,065
powers mostly being an idiot but i

962
00:34:28,065 --> 00:34:29,955

politically in the world like she like

967
00:34:40,035 --> 00:34:42,463

969
00:34:44,955 --> 00:34:45,705

991
00:35:28,665 --> 00:35:29,955
sexes

992
00:35:31,065 --> 00:35:33,675
yeah we it comes from us

993

we we got club got me a

994
00:35:39,195 --> 00:35:41,835
heavy blanket that has holes in it

995
00:35:41,955 --> 00:35:44,385
that makes you feel like you like

996
00:35:44,385 --> 00:35:46,425
it yeah away a weighted blanket but

997
00:35:46,425 --> 00:35:49,245
it's for cooling purposes it's knit so

998
00:35:49,245 --> 00:35:50,925
there's holes so you can just put

999
00:35:50,925 --> 00:35:52,635
a sheet over it and feel like

1000
00:35:52,635 --> 00:35:54,885

and i just want people can take

1104
00:39:31,215 --> 00:39:33,255
pictures of your feet i gotta i

1105
00:39:33,255 --> 00:39:35,655
gotta show up barefoot but i feel

1106
00:39:35,655 --> 00:39:38,025
like i really liked using the machines

1107
00:39:38,055 --> 00:39:39,525
like you know it's just i don't

1108
00:39:39,525 --> 00:39:41,115
have any of this stuff and then

1109
00:39:41,385 --> 00:39:43,185
that went away i feel like my

1110
00:39:43,185 --> 00:39:46,725
phone addiction is skyrocketed yeah my name

1111
00:39:46,755 --> 00:39:49,395
is mark by the way i got

1112
00:39:49,425 --> 00:39:51,465
you know those alerts every week where

1113
00:39:51,465 --> 00:39:52,755
they tell you how much screentime my

1114
00:39:52,755 --> 00:39:55,215
guy to shut off ah i got

1115
00:39:55,215 --> 00:39:56,265
one the other day that i didn't

1116
00:39:56,265 --> 00:39:57,705
think was possible it said

1117
00:39:58,485 --> 00:39:59,865
this week you were on your phone

1118
00:39:59,865 --> 00:40:01,575
for an average of twenty three hours

1119
00:40:01,575 --> 00:40:03,765
a day why i was like why

1120
00:40:03,765 --> 00:40:04,935
did you never sleep

1121
00:40:06,225 --> 00:40:09,795
that doesn't seem possible sleep scrolling but

1122
00:40:09,795 --> 00:40:11,805
the average maybe there was like one

1123
00:40:11,805 --> 00:40:13,394
day you know maybe like i don't

1124
00:40:13,394 --> 00:40:14,235
one day you were on it for

1125
00:40:14,235 --> 00:40:15,945
sixty two hours but then maybe i

1126
00:40:15,945 --> 00:40:18,614
thought maybe my computer and phone sync'd

1127
00:40:18,614 --> 00:40:19,756
up and now they're saying well you

1128
00:40:19,756 --> 00:40:21,465
were on your computer and your flight

1129
00:40:21,465 --> 00:40:24,075
so we know that i mean yeah

1130
00:40:24,105 --> 00:40:25,005
it's like when i'm not on my

1131
00:40:25,005 --> 00:40:26,265
phone i'm on the computer i'm watch

1132
00:40:26,295 --> 00:40:27,555
in tv and i if i'm watching

1133
00:40:27,555 --> 00:40:28,755
tv i'm on my phone like it's

1134
00:40:28,755 --> 00:40:30,465
just there yeah it all goes together

1135
00:40:30,495 --> 00:40:33,555
yeah yeah and it's impossible well but

1136
00:40:33,555 --> 00:40:35,535
when i get those alerts i honestly

1137
00:40:35,565 --> 00:40:37,275
i have said fuck you to them

1138
00:40:37,785 --> 00:40:41,445
fuck you fuck they offended me before

1139
00:40:41,445 --> 00:40:43,245
the pandemic era and now you i

1140
00:40:43,245 --> 00:40:44,835
just let myself do whatever i want

1141
00:40:44,835 --> 00:40:46,215
during this time but i yeah but

1142
00:40:46,215 --> 00:40:46,425
it's

1143
00:40:47,215 --> 00:40:48,985
in my brain i used to read

1144
00:40:48,985 --> 00:40:50,965
a lot more yeah i'm sort of

1145
00:40:50,965 --> 00:40:52,345
looking at the new year as a

1146
00:40:52,345 --> 00:40:54,235
reset for sure yeah it's a good

1147
00:40:54,235 --> 00:40:56,095
idea that maybe it'll just it'll just

1148
00:40:56,125 --> 00:40:59,005
just a feeling of starting a new

1149
00:40:59,095 --> 00:41:02,035
calendar year it is a little i've

1150
00:41:02,035 --> 00:41:04,045
always said like january two is national

1151
00:41:04,045 --> 00:41:05,455
get shit done day because you get

1152
00:41:05,455 --> 00:41:07,135
so many emails of people going like

1153
00:41:07,495 --> 00:41:08,995
hey what if we did you know

1154
00:41:09,085 --> 00:41:10,855
because it's like everyone's putting everything off

1155
00:41:10,855 --> 00:41:13,705
until after the new yeah um but

1156
00:41:13,885 --> 00:41:15,295
yeah i think so i mean you

1157
00:41:15,295 --> 00:41:16,465
want to put everything off so like

1158
00:41:16,465 --> 00:41:19,165
february yeah that since i was doing

1159
00:41:19,165 --> 00:41:21,055
really good working out for five days

1160
00:41:21,055 --> 00:41:21,655
a week

1161
00:41:22,915 --> 00:41:25,525
starting in january during the pandemic all

1162
00:41:25,525 --> 00:41:27,655
the way up to my surge and

1163
00:41:27,655 --> 00:41:29,665
then i was on my back for

1164
00:41:29,665 --> 00:41:30,925
a month and then ever since then

1165
00:41:30,925 --> 00:41:32,455
i've been like it's just so hard

1166
00:41:32,455 --> 00:41:33,685
when you take that much time off

1167
00:41:33,685 --> 00:41:35,725
to get back mentally you know yes

1168
00:41:35,755 --> 00:41:37,765
it is so i think but the

1169
00:41:37,765 --> 00:41:39,325
good news is is once you do

1170
00:41:39,325 --> 00:41:41,815
it the first day you then are

1171
00:41:41,815 --> 00:41:43,015
back mentally as long as

1172
00:41:43,045 --> 00:41:44,634
you follow it up like yeah the

1173
00:41:44,635 --> 00:41:46,525
next day or whatever so and then

1174
00:41:46,525 --> 00:41:47,965
you're just like in it again so

1175
00:41:47,995 --> 00:41:49,495

the doctor yesterday and and i was

1219
00:43:05,515 --> 00:43:07,795
already for this because there's no information

1220
00:43:07,795 --> 00:43:09,625
about when any of the regular people

1221
00:43:09,625 --> 00:43:11,155
get it like no one's ever said

1222
00:43:11,455 --> 00:43:13,345
there's just vague things of leica down

1223
00:43:13,345 --> 00:43:14,395
the road so i was all set

1224
00:43:14,395 --> 00:43:16,765

1227
00:43:19,555 --> 00:43:22,015
even before then saying like ah yeah

1228
00:43:22,015 --> 00:43:23,635
this looks good this looks good and

1229
00:43:23,635 --> 00:43:23,845
obvious

1230
00:43:23,845 --> 00:43:25,405
only you know you're not getting the

1231
00:43:25,405 --> 00:43:28,645
vaccine and for a long time so

1232
00:43:28,855 --> 00:43:30,715

00:43:37,825 --> 00:43:39,325
it to wong but he's a medical

1237
00:43:39,325 --> 00:43:43,465
doctor that's true and doctor druid doctor

1238
00:43:43,465 --> 00:43:44,005

1243
00:43:53,365 --> 00:43:54,895
he wore like a cloak and had

1244
00:43:54,895 --> 00:43:57,355

1310
00:46:02,275 --> 00:46:04,435
well he didn't understand that anything was

1311
00:46:04,435 --> 00:46:06,805
happening yeah that's cool way to come

1312
00:46:06,805 --> 00:46:07,825
but now you might want it

1313
00:46:08,245 --> 00:46:09,895

he's a little too reverend for me

1318
00:46:17,935 --> 00:46:21,205
i my issue was essentially him renouncing

1319
00:46:21,205 --> 00:46:22,465
his ways and go into church

1320
00:46:24,445 --> 00:46:26,845

1321
00:46:26,846 --> 00:46:28,825
like to hear yes i told you

1322
00:46:28,825 --> 00:46:30,565

1328
00:46:43,375 --> 00:46:43,765
board

1329
00:46:43,825 --> 00:46:46,075
in a crazy fuckin yeah but they

1330
00:46:46,075 --> 00:46:47,665
find out he was drunk during it

1331
00:46:47,695 --> 00:46:48,985
and so he goes to trial and

1332
00:46:48,985 --> 00:46:50,095
all this and not let him off

1333
00:46:50,095 --> 00:46:51,145
the hook for that one and the

1334
00:46:51,145 --> 00:46:54,355
very the very ah ah and he

1335
00:46:54,355 --> 00:46:57,205
just keeps on backsliding and when he

1336
00:46:57,233 --> 00:46:59,155
supposed to go to court they lock

1337
00:46:59,155 --> 00:47:00,625
him in a room without any alcohol

1338
00:47:00,625 --> 00:47:02,335
and he figures out how to get

1339
00:47:02,335 --> 00:47:03,925
into the adjoining hotel room

1340
00:47:03,925 --> 00:47:06,955
room and there's like a whole refrigerator

1341
00:47:06,955 --> 00:47:08,425
full of alcohol and cut to the

1342
00:47:08,425 --> 00:47:10,555
next day every bottle he drank every

1343
00:47:10,555 --> 00:47:12,535
bottle and he's drunk anyway so get

1344
00:47:12,535 --> 00:47:13,945
over the the very end he goes

1345
00:47:13,945 --> 00:47:15,595

1346
00:47:15,625 --> 00:47:18,235

you're you're doing a bad job here

well like i mean this issue seems

1560
00:54:53,775 --> 00:54:55,395
i haven't even gotten my first question

1561
00:54:55,485 --> 00:54:59,235
okay which question is as follows okay

1562
00:54:59,235 --> 00:55:01,395
so obviously you both applying to i'm

1563
00:55:01,395 --> 00:55:03,105
looking about toe resumes here and you

1564
00:55:03,105 --> 00:55:06,375
both apply resume what are you doing

1565
00:55:06,765 --> 00:55:08,655
what are you saying it's pronounced resume

1566
00:55:08,655 --> 00:55:10,215
a what is why are you the

1567
00:55:10,215 --> 00:55:13,935
word that you said resume you are

1568
00:55:14,835 --> 00:55:16,455
okay so you're both applying here to

1569
00:55:16,455 --> 00:55:18,945
be shit scoopers for my toilet yes

1570
00:55:19,935 --> 00:55:20,565
that's correct

1571
00:55:21,315 --> 00:55:22,363
i don't like to flesh it out

1572
00:55:22,363 --> 00:55:23,625
like shit to be scooped out and

1573
00:55:23,625 --> 00:55:25,125
put into a bucket i read that

1574
00:55:25,125 --> 00:55:26,385
ad in the paper made perfect sense

1575
00:55:26,385 --> 00:55:28,095
to me i then you want the

1576
00:55:28,095 --> 00:55:29,535
bucket to be taken and this would

1577
00:55:29,535 --> 00:55:31,275
be a different person from you at

1578
00:55:31,275 --> 00:55:32,715
hand the bucket to another person who

1579
00:55:32,715 --> 00:55:33,885
then take it and put it into

1580
00:55:33,885 --> 00:55:36,525
a plant container where one i thought

1581
00:55:36,525 --> 00:55:38,505

both of us did it

1584
00:55:42,765 --> 00:55:44,685
about this bus because i would prefer

1585
00:55:44,685 --> 00:55:46,605
the latter job the first question is

1586
00:55:46,605 --> 00:55:49,785

show and she he was wearing sunglasses

1671
00:58:53,745 --> 00:58:54,855
and they were taking questions from the

1672
00:58:54,855 --> 00:58:56,925
audience and someone said could you lower

00:58:56,925 --> 00:58:58,245
your sunglasses so we could see your

a butter knife switchover a bread knife

we kill her and knife on the

1883
01:06:49,720 --> 01:06:50,770
neck sounds like it would

1884
01:06:50,805 --> 01:06:52,240
hurt because we inject her with something

1885
01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:54,010
so she's dead and then enjoy you
