at that yes we were the survey

was on the island and it was

139
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:22,590
very stressful trying to get all those

140
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:25,380
eggs in time and found something that

141
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:26,610
you can talk about that i don't

142
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:30,360

143
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:31,710
you know wanted to kill that fucking

144
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:33,270
bunny and he's back apparently having been

145
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:34,920
playing for a long time really it's

146
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:37,200
tough news costume i know because either

147
00:05:37,232 --> 00:05:39,810
zipper and haunting and if you touch

148
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:40,050
if you look

149
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:42,000
the zippers stop looking at that yeah

150
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:44,850
but i saw a picture of myself

151
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:45,780
from them and i was like you

152
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:47,250

you put on address and play animal

155
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,980

156
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:53,700
i'm saying

157
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:59,190

like part of me is pissed that

347
00:12:13,155 --> 00:12:15,705

348
00:12:15,705 --> 00:12:17,865

to capture that dude's clock can't wait

514
00:17:42,795 --> 00:17:43,725

516
00:17:45,825 --> 00:17:47,805
yard yeah it comes and gets you

517
00:17:47,805 --> 00:17:49,035
and we've all been like still trying

518
00:17:49,051 --> 00:17:50,175
would have been recruited like

519
00:17:50,265 --> 00:17:53,505
anyway recruited like an independent dream ion

520
00:17:53,565 --> 00:17:56,505
but i also mean your super jumbos

521
00:17:58,155 --> 00:18:00,555
i so it was making me i

522
00:18:00,555 --> 00:18:02,595
started with the oldest stuff because i

523
00:18:02,595 --> 00:18:04,725
thought that would demand a logical when

524
00:18:04,725 --> 00:18:06,675
chronological that that would amuse me and

525
00:18:06,675 --> 00:18:07,905
it didn't it made me feel bad

526
00:18:07,905 --> 00:18:09,375
and i cringed at myself i think

527
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:10,995
that sometimes watching old your stuff isn't

528
00:18:10,995 --> 00:18:13,305
cringe makes watching tomb of these supposed

529
00:18:13,305 --> 00:18:15,345
french sigh yeah and and so it

530
00:18:15,345 --> 00:18:16,755
was it was well you also were

531
00:18:16,755 --> 00:18:17,865
watching your old performer

532
00:18:18,015 --> 00:18:20,145
yeah just home movie it was really

533
00:18:20,145 --> 00:18:21,945
hard and then as i got into

534
00:18:21,945 --> 00:18:25,275
more recent stuff where i was good

535
00:18:25,305 --> 00:18:27,915
i was like oh yeah of course

536
00:18:27,915 --> 00:18:29,985
it's a progression right right but i

537
00:18:29,985 --> 00:18:31,305
was i was in a bad because

538
00:18:31,305 --> 00:18:32,715
i was you know like depressed and

539
00:18:32,715 --> 00:18:33,675
i was in a bad state where

540
00:18:33,675 --> 00:18:35,025
i was like oh i've always been

541
00:18:35,025 --> 00:18:36,735
before now i've overloaded eyes oh my

542
00:18:36,735 --> 00:18:37,905
god i think i'm watching

543
00:18:38,085 --> 00:18:39,135
stuff like that would just make you

544
00:18:39,135 --> 00:18:41,745
think you suck yeah yeah that's exactly

545
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:43,155

548
00:18:47,505 --> 00:18:49,035
i've always because it was a weird

549
00:18:49,035 --> 00:18:51,135
thing where i thought i was like

550
00:18:51,135 --> 00:18:52,395
better in these high school plays than

551
00:18:52,395 --> 00:18:54,075
i was for some reason right yeah

i miss running into people backstage me

665
00:22:35,305 --> 00:22:37,105
too because it was my social life

666
00:22:37,315 --> 00:22:38,695
yeah most probably ninety percent of it

667
00:22:38,695 --> 00:22:40,105
was just the people i ran into

668
00:22:40,135 --> 00:22:42,295
why were sweden we don't actually talk

669
00:22:42,295 --> 00:22:43,825
to these people about real things

670
00:22:45,895 --> 00:22:46,825
that is the thing i'm always saying

671
00:22:46,855 --> 00:22:48,985
we have quite fun to just know

672
00:22:48,985 --> 00:22:50,395
like you have like no you don't

673
00:22:50,395 --> 00:22:52,645
have these deep relationships but you're seeing

674
00:22:52,645 --> 00:22:54,235
people regularly we were like oh hey

675
00:22:54,265 --> 00:22:55,585
yeah and it just feels like oh

676
00:22:55,585 --> 00:22:56,574
i saw people tonight and then you

677
00:22:56,574 --> 00:22:57,835
go home and you're like i have

678
00:22:57,835 --> 00:22:59,785
a social life yeah i don't need

679
00:22:59,785 --> 00:23:01,465
to go out i went with her

680
00:23:01,495 --> 00:23:03,715
once i won't have a random conversation

681
00:23:04,015 --> 00:23:06,055
then have a coffee with every

682
00:23:06,055 --> 00:23:07,735
one once a week and that's all

683
00:23:07,735 --> 00:23:09,475
your whole office opened up is very

684
00:23:09,475 --> 00:23:12,115
social and so she would go out

685
00:23:12,115 --> 00:23:13,255
and see your friends a lot in

686
00:23:13,255 --> 00:23:14,545

692
00:23:22,525 --> 00:23:24,835

growing to the size of its bowl

735
00:24:47,725 --> 00:24:50,035
is like you shrink down to what

736
00:24:50,035 --> 00:24:51,265
your life is at the time and

737
00:24:51,265 --> 00:24:52,915
it feels the same as it did

738
00:24:52,975 --> 00:24:55,435
yeah i feel always just feel exhausting

739
00:24:55,585 --> 00:24:55,975
kind

740
00:24:56,005 --> 00:24:57,535
of just weirdly i will go on

741
00:24:57,535 --> 00:24:59,245
like why did your frame of mind

742
00:24:59,305 --> 00:25:00,835
right my thing lately is that i'm

743
00:25:00,835 --> 00:25:02,545
like i will go for a walk

744
00:25:02,545 --> 00:25:05,995
in a different neighborhood and then i

745
00:25:06,295 --> 00:25:07,795
like just somewhere where i know there

746
00:25:07,795 --> 00:25:09,235
aren't a lot of people out but

747
00:25:09,235 --> 00:25:10,405
that i can have a pleasant walk

748
00:25:10,405 --> 00:25:12,655
and look at some pretty houses and

749
00:25:12,655 --> 00:25:14,455
then i'll get my car and kinda

750
00:25:14,455 --> 00:25:15,895
like drive and just like see what's

751
00:25:15,895 --> 00:25:16,135
going

752
00:25:16,135 --> 00:25:17,965
hang on and like this feels like

753
00:25:17,965 --> 00:25:19,135
i had a day like that so

754
00:25:19,225 --> 00:25:21,025
i think yeah and then i'll look

755
00:25:21,025 --> 00:25:23,155
at the people living their life like

756
00:25:23,155 --> 00:25:24,565
it's normal and then i feel crazy

757
00:25:24,565 --> 00:25:25,375
when i get back at my house

758
00:25:25,375 --> 00:25:26,785
and you're like wow i drove in

759
00:25:26,785 --> 00:25:30,505
pasadena and like everyone's having lunch outside

760
00:25:30,535 --> 00:25:32,515
know there's definitely a bike was talking

761
00:25:32,515 --> 00:25:33,535
to someone the other day who's like

762
00:25:33,565 --> 00:25:35,455

763
00:25:35,485 --> 00:25:36,295

768
00:25:43,885 --> 00:25:45,955
and it's weird someone i guess so

769
00:25:45,955 --> 00:25:47,335
yes it's up to me on twitter

770
00:25:47,335 --> 00:25:50,159
like i posted something about a camera

771
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:52,105

for some people they they don't have

00:26:18,145 --> 00:26:19,555
hearing this from the things that are

786
00:26:19,555 --> 00:26:21,775

788
00:26:24,085 --> 00:26:25,854
georgia i hate that i know what

00:26:25,854 --> 00:26:28,525
zoom is yeah i love it i

790
00:26:28,525 --> 00:26:30,205

791
00:26:30,205 --> 00:26:33,205
you know what i think ignored you

792
00:26:33,205 --> 00:26:34,945
know what i think about that this

793
00:26:34,945 --> 00:26:36,235
was i was thinking about like when

794
00:26:36,235 --> 00:26:36,775
we go back

795
00:26:36,775 --> 00:26:39,595
i'm like i i would like to

796
00:26:39,835 --> 00:26:41,665
suggest that times i don't feel like

797
00:26:41,755 --> 00:26:43,645
if i'm gonna do someone's podcasts but

798
00:26:43,645 --> 00:26:44,425
i don't really have all the time

799
00:26:44,425 --> 00:26:45,235
in the world i could do it

800
00:26:45,235 --> 00:26:47,005
on zoom yeah absolutely and then we

801
00:26:47,005 --> 00:26:49,195
can make it easier on everyone or

802
00:26:49,195 --> 00:26:50,995
like a general meeting like you would

803
00:26:50,995 --> 00:26:53,785
normally have to drive our dropzone twenty

804
00:26:53,785 --> 00:26:55,015
minutes or want to do that and

805
00:26:55,015 --> 00:26:56,623
then drive home for an hour and

806
00:26:56,624 --> 00:26:56,843
we'll

807
00:26:57,243 --> 00:26:59,215
pitching is good on zoom i don't

808
00:26:59,215 --> 00:27:01,825
like that i've the really i prefer

809
00:27:01,825 --> 00:27:03,565
it to doing an in person i've

810
00:27:03,565 --> 00:27:05,785
done so many just here

811
00:27:05,935 --> 00:27:08,935
so if i know none of them

812
00:27:08,965 --> 00:27:10,975
worked none of mine have either yeah

813
00:27:11,035 --> 00:27:12,355
none of my day there because i

814
00:27:12,355 --> 00:27:14,215
liked the noise but i was buying

815
00:27:14,395 --> 00:27:16,135
but i think it's flat like i

816
00:27:16,135 --> 00:27:17,695
think it's the sales flat i can't

817
00:27:17,695 --> 00:27:19,375
make my like off the cuff jokes

818
00:27:19,375 --> 00:27:20,425
because like i'm like dude anyway i

819
00:27:20,425 --> 00:27:22,195
still make fun i'm great at it

820
00:27:22,195 --> 00:27:23,995
but wow okay but i feel like

821
00:27:24,055 --> 00:27:25,705
it's like people aren't even seeing my

822
00:27:25,705 --> 00:27:25,945
face

823
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,985
you're looking at like whatever you've pulled

824
00:27:27,985 --> 00:27:29,575
up on the screen and then it'll

825
00:27:29,575 --> 00:27:31,345
just feels like yeah i think there's

826
00:27:31,345 --> 00:27:33,235
a way to do it though that

827
00:27:33,235 --> 00:27:36,775
you can maximize the the zoom experience

828
00:27:37,015 --> 00:27:38,095
for the pitch you know what the

829
00:27:38,095 --> 00:27:39,955
problem with my mind words the beginning

830
00:27:39,955 --> 00:27:41,605
which i also the people i'm pitching

831
00:27:41,635 --> 00:27:43,195
to are not figured people i'm pitching

832
00:27:43,195 --> 00:27:45,115
to mute themselves so you don't get

833
00:27:45,115 --> 00:27:46,135
a reaction if you ever

834
00:27:46,165 --> 00:27:48,175
making off the off the cuff joke

835
00:27:48,475 --> 00:27:50,305
like you make you make funny really

836
00:27:50,305 --> 00:27:51,675
didn't work you make a funny joke

837
00:27:51,727 --> 00:27:53,155
they feel like well that just fucking

838
00:27:53,185 --> 00:27:54,775
fell flat and then because you look

839
00:27:54,776 --> 00:27:56,905
people that laugh without smiling yes i

840
00:27:56,905 --> 00:27:59,395

00:33:25,425 --> 00:33:27,735
now i'm mean obviously that was twenty

1003
00:33:27,735 --> 00:33:29,925
years ago that i was like whatever

1004
00:33:29,925 --> 00:33:33,165

1005
00:33:33,165 --> 00:33:34,605
you did you move to l a

1006
00:33:34,623 --> 00:33:35,655
in hopes of meeting him

1007
00:33:36,315 --> 00:33:37,395
you know what i think you know

1008
00:33:37,395 --> 00:33:40,005
what i have thought it is weird

1009
00:33:40,065 --> 00:33:42,405
when you and i'm sure you have

1010
00:33:42,405 --> 00:33:44,415
this about people where you like new

1011
00:33:44,415 --> 00:33:46,305
so you know he was famous before

1012
00:33:46,305 --> 00:33:48,225
i could ever have met him in

1013
00:33:48,225 --> 00:33:50,265
my life and so i have known

1014
00:33:50,265 --> 00:33:51,345
of him for a long time and

1015
00:33:51,345 --> 00:33:52,425
then suddenly you're just in the same

1016
00:33:52,425 --> 00:33:53,745
room as them and you're like oh

1017
00:33:53,745 --> 00:33:54,825
so i could have actually ended up

1018
00:33:54,915 --> 00:33:56,355
marrying him like

1019
00:33:56,445 --> 00:33:58,635
be like like if a you know

1020
00:33:58,755 --> 00:34:00,825
we have mutual friends like oh yeah

1021
00:34:00,885 --> 00:34:01,965
and he then it's like that's a

1022
00:34:01,995 --> 00:34:03,465
crazy thing when like he were to

1023
00:34:03,465 --> 00:34:07,245
date an asshole once me if you

1024
00:34:07,245 --> 00:34:09,375
like lower standards one obviously he's like

1025
00:34:09,375 --> 00:34:11,475
jennifer aniston's i'm not saying that but

1026
00:34:11,475 --> 00:34:13,455
i'm just saying you could meet the

1027
00:34:13,455 --> 00:34:15,435
person you could have a connection yeah

1028
00:34:15,465 --> 00:34:16,575
that is possible it's na

1029
00:34:16,575 --> 00:34:18,075
not just an insane because when i

1030
00:34:18,075 --> 00:34:18,975
was in high school i thought i

1031
00:34:18,975 --> 00:34:20,955
could marry him is my point right

1032
00:34:21,105 --> 00:34:22,545
and then it's like you get to

1033
00:34:22,545 --> 00:34:23,775
a place where like i actually have

1034
00:34:23,775 --> 00:34:25,845

1035
00:34:25,852 --> 00:34:27,015

plowright and they are all actors they

1145
00:38:14,415 --> 00:38:16,665
are long-lived people they sit around and

1146
00:38:16,665 --> 00:38:18,075
they fucking tell stories and it is

1147
00:38:18,075 --> 00:38:19,425
great but see this is the thing

1148
00:38:19,425 --> 00:38:19,695
about

1149
00:38:19,695 --> 00:38:21,495
what about celebrities that you want to

1150
00:38:21,495 --> 00:38:24,225
be friends with or whatever you really

1151
00:38:24,225 --> 00:38:26,295
don't know what metal poles are like

1152
00:38:26,325 --> 00:38:28,395
at all yes and like i think

1153
00:38:28,575 --> 00:38:30,075
there's people that i've worked with where

1154
00:38:30,075 --> 00:38:31,665
i ended up being their friend and

1155
00:38:31,665 --> 00:38:32,925
i'm so surprised none of those people

1156
00:38:32,925 --> 00:38:34,095
that i think i'd be friends with

1157
00:38:34,095 --> 00:38:35,115
who i just don't have a vibe

1158
00:38:35,115 --> 00:38:36,645
with that yeah i will say that

1159
00:38:36,675 --> 00:38:39,495
older actors are fun to hang out

1160
00:38:39,495 --> 00:38:39,855
with you

1161
00:38:39,855 --> 00:38:41,805
yeah and if you can add alcohol

1162
00:38:41,805 --> 00:38:43,605
to that it's even better yeah like

1163
00:38:43,605 --> 00:38:45,585
when they tell stories about theatre pizza

1164
00:38:45,585 --> 00:38:46,995
i love theater p yeah when they

1165
00:38:46,995 --> 00:38:49,125
start telling stories it's really fun yeah

1166
00:38:49,125 --> 00:38:51,585
movie people who have not done theater

1167
00:38:51,615 --> 00:38:53,535
are not as fun i think that's

1168
00:38:53,535 --> 00:38:54,375
it yeah yeah

1169
00:38:55,575 --> 00:38:57,735
yeah i also think when people are

1170
00:38:58,065 --> 00:39:00,015
it's harder when they're just right there's

1171
00:39:00,015 --> 00:39:01,875
an actor who would never had to

1172
00:39:01,875 --> 00:39:04,275
do comedy because i feel like coming

1173
00:39:04,275 --> 00:39:05,745
up in that way you like half

1174
00:39:05,745 --> 00:39:09,315
to um be personable in a certain

1175
00:39:09,315 --> 00:39:11,715
way yeah and some actors are in

1176
00:39:11,715 --> 00:39:13,575
their own world so much that you

1177
00:39:13,575 --> 00:39:15,615
just they really are amazing on

1178
00:39:15,645 --> 00:39:16,965
screen and when you're working in the

1179
00:39:16,965 --> 00:39:19,635
scene they're amazing and then off they're

1180
00:39:19,635 --> 00:39:21,465
kind of like not giving you anything

1181
00:39:21,495 --> 00:39:22,785
you are and who do you wish

1182
00:39:22,785 --> 00:39:24,465

1194
00:39:50,835 --> 00:39:52,455
up as the easter pig to go

1195
00:39:52,875 --> 00:39:55,095

00:40:20,025 --> 00:40:24,915
nanny mcphee probably mary poppins yeah yeah

1210
00:40:24,945 --> 00:40:26,145
you gotta give it up to pop-in

1211
00:40:26,265 --> 00:40:27,495
nanny mcphee is just an ugly mary

1212
00:40:27,495 --> 00:40:29,565

to carol burnett again and she's being

1371
00:45:24,510 --> 00:45:25,890
funny do you see the carol burnett

1372
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:28,620
the documentary about the the play she

1373
00:45:28,620 --> 00:45:32,370
was in it's really fascinating this sounds

1374
00:45:32,370 --> 00:45:34,350
familiar i haven't seen a documentary maybe

1375
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:36,633
i remember hearing about this so she's

1376
00:45:36,633 --> 00:45:38,880
it she's cast in this play and

1377
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:39,300
she's

1378
00:45:39,330 --> 00:45:42,030
like cast and a documentary about putting

1379
00:45:42,030 --> 00:45:43,890
this play up on it's feet and

1380
00:45:43,890 --> 00:45:45,510
the cast carol burnett because she's a

1381
00:45:45,510 --> 00:45:48,210
name but as i recall the movie

1382
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:51,600
the producers never really liked carol burnett

1383
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:54,360
never really on earth never like only

1384
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:55,590
caster because she was a name and

1385
00:45:55,590 --> 00:45:57,510
was kind of resistant to i'm honestly

1386
00:45:57,510 --> 00:45:59,100
confused i feel like i read about

1387
00:45:59,100 --> 00:45:59,331
this

1388
00:45:59,550 --> 00:46:02,310
something wouldn't let her do like things

1389
00:46:02,310 --> 00:46:03,720
she wanted to do in the play

1390
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:06,090
and stuff like that but then open

1391
00:46:06,090 --> 00:46:07,500
and they're they're treating her like shit

1392
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:09,540
i think yeah and then opening night

1393
00:46:10,170 --> 00:46:13,590
the power goes out in the play

1394
00:46:13,590 --> 00:46:15,000
and they're light and the producers are

1395
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,079
like what do we do what do

1396
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:18,030
we do and they say carol will

1397
00:46:18,030 --> 00:46:19,620
you go out and entertain

1398
00:46:19,620 --> 00:46:22,020
stain them my guy and she goes

1399
00:46:22,020 --> 00:46:25,140
out and basically just fields questions for

1400
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:27,180
an hour whichever i thought was better

1401
00:46:27,180 --> 00:46:28,980
than the pl yes waiting for the

1402
00:46:29,010 --> 00:46:30,990
waiting for the the lights to come

1403

1404
00:46:32,910 --> 00:46:34,890

1406
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:38,880

1409
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,040

it's very specific yeah it is your

1651
00:56:43,705 --> 00:56:45,835
problem is for the listener the physicality
