um so i had to go in

154
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:52,530

157
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,370
to air just out of curiosity you

158
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:00,720
have to say exact dates but like

159
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:02,550
month general likes i'm curious what the

160
00:06:02,561 --> 00:06:04,710
timeline is working with the covert that's

161
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:07,380
a good question i know they finish

162
00:06:07,406 --> 00:06:08,850
production can't finish

163
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:12,600
gotta pay for defender production around around

164
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:14,820
christmas i think oh okay it's probably

165
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:17,640
i mean it's you know what's taking

166
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,660
a lot not to get too deep

167
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:22,230
into production but color correction is taking

168
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:23,850
the longest time because you can't do

169
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:26,670
that over you like zoom you can't

170
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,040
oh the advantage over zoo

171
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,080
boom because like you can share screen

172
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,190
and look at the edits but the

173
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:33,840
color you can't do it in high

174
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,700
definition the way you have to sew

175
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,200
gives you along with a little dropper

176
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,540
yeah anyway so are in each person

177
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:40,980
i put some rosy cheeks on

178
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,340
mirror mirror

179
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:45,930
hello

180
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:49,350

181
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:53,310
um so you say you're on a

182
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:54,780
show so yeah so i get to

183
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:58,380

184
00:06:58,380 --> 00:06:59,730

unmatchable location where they give you a

250
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:05,730
look dollar was like everything is just

251
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:08,224
like one hundred universal plaza that's like

then they had me come in and

563
00:19:58,050 --> 00:20:00,360

564
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:03,840
different services um one where i administered

565
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,490
the test myself one where somebody else

566
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,160
administered it um the same test they're

567
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,780
in competition with each other yeah who

568
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:11,220
does it better to see yeah and

569
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:13,200

570
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:14,760
so so i get the results the

571
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,050
one test was a rapid test that

572
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:17,520
i got the results in within a

573
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,240
half hour

574
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:21,380

00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:27,950
and they just shout negative who gives

578
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:31,070
a hay but it's like maybe because

579
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:32,330

631
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:31,640

from a million i know i do

636
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:40,190
think it's more rare here to have

637
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:41,450
had it right like i feel like

638
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:43,160
i thought in california that did they

639
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:44,960
suspect last round of people have it

640
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,000

00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:03,048
sickness that everyone was just kind of

645
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:05,000
like wow we we think it's strep

646
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,160

647
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,270

648
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:10,130
antibodies but ah who knows well they're

649
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:11,450
probably gone by now sorry to say

650
00:23:13,430 --> 00:23:14,660
anyway we are by the way we're

651
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:16,850
recording oh yeah we've we met your

652
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:19,790
one beauty little women reference

653
00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:22,882
when she cuts her hair is is

654
00:23:22,882 --> 00:23:24,590
this from just all of them or

655
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:26,360
the northern reason frankly i think it's

656
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:27,740
in the book i read

657
00:23:29,316 --> 00:23:31,070
they they call they call her hair

658
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:33,920
her one beauty because she looks likely

659
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:36,230
after she gets it i mean according

660
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:38,362
to don't all women yeah your hair

661
00:23:38,362 --> 00:23:39,500
better be dandy but

662
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:41,750
i don't watch the new little woman

663
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:43,940
but i would like to and i'm

664
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,380
home alone this weekend so it feels

665
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:47,060
like the perfect time to oh where's

666
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:50,270
my go in this is awesome oh

667
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:53,360
well i guess i've also invested i

668
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,220
mean it's i feel i guess it's

669
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:57,140
weird with covert that whatever you do

670
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:59,930
anything it can be so criticized yes

671
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:00,800
um so

672
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:03,110
l f consider cutting this out but

673
00:24:03,410 --> 00:24:05,720
he's his friend is alone at his

674
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,640
parents' house in vegas has like best

675
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,380
friend from la so he got both

676
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:10,550
got tested in there hanging out at

677
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:12,260
that house telling people and it's fun

678
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:13,760
that's fine um yeah i think it's

679
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,860
fine to i but you know sometimes

680
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:17,660
people are really if people are working

681
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:19,850
on said i think going totally testing

682
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:20,960
yourself and hanging out yeah

683
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,790
yeah i think if you're taking precautions

684
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:25,160
there's there's nothing wrong with that yeah

685
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:26,690

00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:31,100
yeah yeah yeah the audience is like

834
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:33,140
what happened to me

835
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,810
on the show um i'm gonna do

836
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,460
the ah the mail-in ballot but i'm

837
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:38,690
probably going to drop it off when

838
00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:41,360
i'm okay because also one thing i'm

839
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,370
confused about is that i'm already signed

840
00:29:43,370 --> 00:29:46,100
up for mail-in ballots so i can't

841
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:47,960
change that right are you like permanent

842
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:50,270
mail-in i don't know you can change

843
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:52,310
it yeah oh okay because i just

844
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:53,360
figured well rather than

845
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:55,130
like messing up what i've already done

846
00:29:55,130 --> 00:29:56,420
i'll just get that and go drop

847
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:58,340
it off at the proper location which

848
00:29:58,617 --> 00:29:59,840
i don't like you to have mailing

849
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,940
it in the mail i know that

850
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:03,460
feels not enough me i want to

851
00:30:03,546 --> 00:30:05,390
go into some point that it's like

852
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:07,460
meant for that there's also there's also

853
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:09,890
a service ah i think it's called

854
00:30:09,890 --> 00:30:11,720
ballot tracks where you can track your

855
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,520

863
00:30:29,690 --> 00:30:32,300
it was so necessary um because my

864
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:33,680
hair had gotten really dry

865
00:30:34,405 --> 00:30:36,025
very long and just like chunk it

867
00:30:37,435 --> 00:30:39,925

that the the three of us went

00:30:48,475 --> 00:30:50,005
to the drive-in movie thanks right yeah

873
00:30:50,065 --> 00:30:51,505
we haven't talked about on this show

874
00:30:51,505 --> 00:30:53,665
we we went to a drive-in movie

875
00:30:53,665 --> 00:30:56,455
on my birthday we saw jars it

876
00:30:56,455 --> 00:30:58,315
was really fun to see drawers it

877
00:30:58,315 --> 00:30:59,575
was fun to see yours and then

878
00:30:59,575 --> 00:31:01,225
we were also going to see tremors

879
00:31:01,225 --> 00:31:02,395
and then we all love we all

880
00:31:02,395 --> 00:31:02,545
know

881
00:31:02,815 --> 00:31:04,555
she was tired because we watched tremors

882
00:31:04,555 --> 00:31:07,495
at home and probably is probably always

883
00:31:07,495 --> 00:31:08,965
in the summer is that it doesn't

884
00:31:08,965 --> 00:31:11,068
get dark until a thirty or so

885
00:31:11,068 --> 00:31:13,645
or eighty five and then after jaws

886
00:31:13,645 --> 00:31:15,595
it's ten forty five and weigh what

887
00:31:15,685 --> 00:31:17,005
we're supposed to do stay up another

888
00:31:17,005 --> 00:31:18,895
two and three hours and i just

889
00:31:18,895 --> 00:31:20,635
had a sangha and i'm ready to

890
00:31:20,635 --> 00:31:21,925
go to bed i had the best

891
00:31:21,925 --> 00:31:22,855
time it was so fun

892
00:31:22,855 --> 00:31:24,595
i was driving i felt like you

893
00:31:24,595 --> 00:31:26,425
had ever mentioned i think i had

894
00:31:26,425 --> 00:31:28,135
never been to address that oh i

895
00:31:28,135 --> 00:31:29,395
guess would they not have them in

896
00:31:29,395 --> 00:31:30,955
chicago or do they have them they

897
00:31:30,955 --> 00:31:33,085
probably have something but i've i don't

898
00:31:33,085 --> 00:31:35,575
think i'd ever been to one maybe

899
00:31:35,575 --> 00:31:38,271
once but mike debt never had joined

900
00:31:38,455 --> 00:31:40,405
i've never had like doc never had

901
00:31:41,125 --> 00:31:42,865
any duck had never been as well

902
00:31:43,615 --> 00:31:44,996
it was so new and it was

903
00:31:44,996 --> 00:31:46,552
so truly it was because we hadn't

904
00:31:46,552 --> 00:31:47,875
left the house in months it felt

905
00:31:47,875 --> 00:31:49,285
like a vacation yeah we had to

906
00:31:49,315 --> 00:31:50,725
dry when you know anyone wants to

907
00:31:51,085 --> 00:31:52,285
throw forty five minutes we sat in

908
00:31:52,285 --> 00:31:54,355
a big long line of cars yeah

909
00:31:54,385 --> 00:31:56,785

00:31:56,785 --> 00:31:59,305

simple that was and then there are

955
00:33:33,025 --> 00:33:34,345

and i was like this is the

960
00:33:39,085 --> 00:33:40,495
most dangerous thing i've ever done to

961
00:33:40,495 --> 00:33:42,835
stand next to people next to strangers

964
00:33:45,985 --> 00:33:47,035
that someone could just turn to you

965
00:33:47,035 --> 00:33:48,925
and go oh by the way yeah

966
00:33:48,925 --> 00:33:50,635

971
00:33:59,365 --> 00:34:00,625

979
00:34:17,905 --> 00:34:20,785

00:34:25,525 --> 00:34:26,815
they so you'd see that in the

983
00:34:26,815 --> 00:34:28,315
track listing if it's a skit i

984
00:34:28,345 --> 00:34:30,175

i'll sketches skits if you went back

986
00:34:32,125 --> 00:34:34,255
in time and say you had to

987
00:34:34,255 --> 00:34:35,755

certain things that if i'm living my

1029

1030
00:36:12,355 --> 00:36:13,885

the other stout open marriage

1037
00:36:27,925 --> 00:36:29,245
i'll lay the groundwork for that

1038
00:36:30,535 --> 00:36:33,175
an open marriages that we know i

1039
00:36:33,205 --> 00:36:36,205
found out about too that i was

1040
00:36:36,205 --> 00:36:38,377
very surprised about during the good times

1041
00:36:38,587 --> 00:36:40,045
how many future divorces are about

1042
00:36:41,515 --> 00:36:43,195
just like friends that later i found

1043
00:36:43,195 --> 00:36:44,215
out oh they were in an open

1044
00:36:44,215 --> 00:36:45,325
marriage i got here when they were

1045
00:36:45,325 --> 00:36:46,555
in a marriage oh i know we

1046
00:36:46,555 --> 00:36:48,115
might know one that's the same okay

1047
00:36:48,235 --> 00:36:49,885
we'll have to get all these names

1048
00:36:49,885 --> 00:36:52,525
after the odd yes go ahead ah

1049
00:36:52,525 --> 00:36:55,585
um and i was so i was

1050
00:36:55,585 --> 00:36:56,995
like in the dream i was mapping

1051
00:36:56,995 --> 00:36:58,645
out like all the stuff you would

1052
00:36:58,645 --> 00:37:00,235
redo in your life yes it's like

1053
00:37:00,265 --> 00:37:01,255
okay so these points

1054
00:37:01,285 --> 00:37:02,575
i definitely want to do i would

1055
00:37:02,575 --> 00:37:04,015
definitely do these things the same oh

1056
00:37:04,015 --> 00:37:05,725
my god but other things are like

1057
00:37:05,725 --> 00:37:07,435
mistakes i made a wrong decisions or

1058
00:37:07,435 --> 00:37:09,475
whatever that i can correct you get

1059
00:37:09,475 --> 00:37:11,455
an early on that ah star wars

1060
00:37:11,455 --> 00:37:15,805
podcast before ah dude if only you

1061
00:37:15,835 --> 00:37:18,775
were in on that oh man but

1062
00:37:19,225 --> 00:37:21,175
i have a question with that with

1063
00:37:21,175 --> 00:37:21,415
that key

1064
00:37:21,415 --> 00:37:23,065
concept i mean in your dream i

1065
00:37:23,065 --> 00:37:24,505
don't know what the rules were whatever

1066
00:37:24,505 --> 00:37:26,575
but if you like do you believe

1067
00:37:26,605 --> 00:37:27,625
like in your mind like i like

1068
00:37:27,625 --> 00:37:29,275
one thing that stops me from feeling

1069
00:37:29,275 --> 00:37:31,525
really bad about things that i regret

1070
00:37:31,555 --> 00:37:33,115
is that the other things wouldn't have

1071
00:37:33,115 --> 00:37:35,095
happened if i didn't do those right

1072
00:37:35,095 --> 00:37:36,565
yeah well yeah that's something you'd have

1073
00:37:36,565 --> 00:37:37,885
to you'd have to really sit and

1074
00:37:37,885 --> 00:37:39,595
think like okay what what were the

1075
00:37:39,595 --> 00:37:41,485
repercussions of this

1076
00:37:41,785 --> 00:37:43,405
did anything good come out of this

1077
00:37:43,405 --> 00:37:45,475
wasn't just like sort of a push

1078
00:37:45,505 --> 00:37:48,565
in my life you know um or

1079
00:37:49,345 --> 00:37:50,905
yeah i know like if i thought

1080
00:37:50,995 --> 00:37:53,185
okay if i if i would approach

1081
00:37:53,185 --> 00:37:55,195
this differently maybe the show would have

1082
00:37:55,195 --> 00:37:58,645
lasted longer and i and out i

1083
00:37:58,645 --> 00:38:00,445
know what the notes were about this

1084
00:38:00,445 --> 00:38:01,645
i could change oh when i

1085
00:38:01,735 --> 00:38:02,875
like about oh i always think like

1086
00:38:02,905 --> 00:38:05,485
okay i'll work harder because all of

1087
00:38:05,485 --> 00:38:07,165
this stuff that i wasted my time

1088
00:38:07,165 --> 00:38:08,725
with i've already wasted my time with

1089
00:38:08,725 --> 00:38:10,555
it i've read the books or write

1090
00:38:10,555 --> 00:38:11,865
c d all so i hated all

1091
00:38:11,865 --> 00:38:14,095
hours so i did or or even

1092
00:38:14,095 --> 00:38:15,535
just like in my spare time like

1093
00:38:15,535 --> 00:38:17,275
hobbies and stuff oh i already already

1094
00:38:17,275 --> 00:38:18,805
did but then i think like how

1095
00:38:18,805 --> 00:38:20,425
many times you reread books and stuff

1096
00:38:20,425 --> 00:38:21,895
like that i'd probably just waste

1097
00:38:21,895 --> 00:38:23,305
the same amount of time i feel

1098
00:38:23,305 --> 00:38:24,295
like i would waste all this i

1099
00:38:24,295 --> 00:38:25,435
mean i think i have this thought

1100
00:38:25,435 --> 00:38:27,865
during this time while we have you

1101
00:38:27,865 --> 00:38:29,365
know there's this assumption that you have

1102
00:38:29,365 --> 00:38:30,415
a lot of free time which i

1103
00:38:30,415 --> 00:38:32,095
don't really feel is accurate i feel

1104
00:38:32,095 --> 00:38:34,465
very much like my free time as

1105
00:38:34,735 --> 00:38:37,525
i'm barely relaxed i'm not like it's

1106
00:38:37,675 --> 00:38:40,321
on vacation i'm like mentally stressed it's

1107
00:38:40,321 --> 00:38:41,980
something like not really free time because

1108
00:38:42,055 --> 00:38:44,935
you're you're constantly managing your anxiety yeah

1109
00:38:45,145 --> 00:38:47,545
that's getting a horrible virus yeah there's

1110
00:38:47,545 --> 00:38:49,825
all these things that that like we

1111
00:38:49,825 --> 00:38:52,435
just moved here about a year ago

1112
00:38:52,435 --> 00:38:54,595
and it's like i put these things

1113
00:38:54,595 --> 00:38:56,335
to unpack like when i have time

1114
00:38:56,335 --> 00:38:58,195
oh yes and it's like well maybe

1115
00:38:58,195 --> 00:38:59,725
you're never gonna get to it yes

1116
00:38:59,725 --> 00:39:01,435
like if you haven't during covert yeah

1117
00:39:01,435 --> 00:39:02,185
at the same time yeah

1118
00:39:02,245 --> 00:39:05,425
you're like constantly trying to figure out

1119
00:39:05,485 --> 00:39:07,405
just the world and and we're saying

1120
00:39:07,405 --> 00:39:09,175
i think heart health is happening during

1121
00:39:09,175 --> 00:39:10,675
an election year though now focused on

1122
00:39:10,735 --> 00:39:12,115
and that all all the horrible things

1123
00:39:12,115 --> 00:39:13,405
happening in the world and then you

1124
00:39:13,405 --> 00:39:15,985
have all the stress oh things are

1125
00:39:15,985 --> 00:39:17,995
going i have work but then i

1126
00:39:17,995 --> 00:39:20,305
think our business also really expects you

1127
00:39:20,305 --> 00:39:22,195
to keep going in this weird way

1128
00:39:22,225 --> 00:39:22,375
which

1129
00:39:22,587 --> 00:39:24,655
this is all unprecedented so it's whatever

1130
00:39:24,655 --> 00:39:26,605
but like there's so much self motivating

1131
00:39:26,605 --> 00:39:28,015
that you're supposed to do anyway but

1132
00:39:28,015 --> 00:39:29,155
then people are kind of going like

1133
00:39:29,185 --> 00:39:30,385
where's that thing why are you doing

1134
00:39:30,385 --> 00:39:32,095
away and then there's this pressure and

1135
00:39:32,095 --> 00:39:33,709
i feel like it's really bad sure

1136
00:39:34,945 --> 00:39:35,995
i think it's really bad like when

1137
00:39:35,995 --> 00:39:37,615
you watch a tv show and billy

1138
00:39:37,615 --> 00:39:39,085
joel's pressure comes on because the you

1139
00:39:39,115 --> 00:39:41,365
know the main characters under a lot

1140
00:39:41,365 --> 00:39:43,525
of pressure yeah i think i know

1141
00:39:43,525 --> 00:39:45,625
exactly what you're talking about yes okay

1142
00:39:45,625 --> 00:39:47,455
so but back to my original question

1143
00:39:47,935 --> 00:39:48,895
if you had to go back to

1144
00:39:48,895 --> 00:39:50,605
your own q yeah boom i had

1145
00:39:50,605 --> 00:39:52,105
to go back to this beginning of

1146
00:39:52,105 --> 00:39:54,415
your life what would you get the

1147
00:39:54,415 --> 00:39:55,015
most for

1148
00:39:55,015 --> 00:39:58,675
frustrated with in terms of like technology

1149
00:39:58,675 --> 00:40:01,405
like my loving having all the ones

1150
00:40:01,435 --> 00:40:02,995
you've already lived in oh so it's

1151
00:40:02,995 --> 00:40:05,035
like i but i but you retain

1152
00:40:05,035 --> 00:40:07,375
your memories so i it's the nineties

1153
00:40:07,375 --> 00:40:08,995
but i know that i'll eventually have

1154
00:40:09,025 --> 00:40:10,195
you're trying to say you were born

1155
00:40:10,195 --> 00:40:11,725
in the nineties no but i'm saying

1156
00:40:11,725 --> 00:40:13,315
if i wasn't cognizant of my life

1157
00:40:13,345 --> 00:40:15,175
before that i just wondered if

1158
00:40:15,205 --> 00:40:17,245
you had like a recent because i've

1159
00:40:17,245 --> 00:40:19,885
known people who have revised their ages

1160
00:40:19,945 --> 00:40:22,345
oh my god birth years i know

1161
00:40:22,345 --> 00:40:23,905
people like that too drives me nuts

1162
00:40:24,535 --> 00:40:27,244
but i know i yeah i live

1163
00:40:27,264 --> 00:40:28,615
in the eighties i was like a

1164
00:40:28,615 --> 00:40:30,205
little care so i wasn't aware of

1165
00:40:30,205 --> 00:40:31,225
what i did or did not have

1166
00:40:31,255 --> 00:40:32,635
but i'm saying no but you would

1167
00:40:32,635 --> 00:40:34,285
now like you you have your memories

1168
00:40:34,285 --> 00:40:35,335
from but having

1169
00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:37,740
both brain that's too much being a

1170
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:39,720
little kid when there is essentially a

1171
00:40:39,810 --> 00:40:41,695
contract basis of some science fiction and

1172
00:40:41,695 --> 00:40:43,710
actually the current x-men comics this is

1173
00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:45,330
a subplot in it so wait my

1174
00:40:45,330 --> 00:40:47,040
question is if it's been a let's

1175
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:49,320
say i'm ten yeah and so i'm

1176
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:50,700
aware when i'm watching tv that i

1177
00:40:50,730 --> 00:40:52,440
could be on my phone and watching

1178
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:55,290
tedious yeah this is what i'm getting

1179
00:40:55,339 --> 00:40:56,160
ah

1180
00:40:56,574 --> 00:40:58,590
we didn't just drive you insane to

1181
00:40:58,590 --> 00:41:00,330
have to watch tv worst of all

1182
00:41:00,330 --> 00:41:01,650
in the nineties i tell you with

1183
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:04,320
with really small tds you know when

1184
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:07,470
the internet was coming ah when chat

1185
00:41:07,470 --> 00:41:08,880
rooms and aol were thing i was

1186
00:41:08,910 --> 00:41:11,370
in like i was like so twelve

1187
00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:13,290
yeah and so it became a huge

1188
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,790
obsession and my brother and i were

1189
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:16,290
constantly sneaking to go

1190
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:18,720
online which we we have like stolen

1191
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:22,380
ah my uncle's internet information so somehow

1192
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:23,520
we were routing it through our house

1193
00:41:23,550 --> 00:41:24,450
i don't know how my brother did

1194
00:41:24,450 --> 00:41:26,040
it honestly we were kids and we

1195
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:27,270
were online and we ended up starting

1196
00:41:27,330 --> 00:41:29,610
a huge bill to my uncle oh

1197
00:41:29,610 --> 00:41:31,800
we didn't find out until later and

1198
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:32,820
we got in trouble but we would

1199
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:34,470
just go in his room lock the

1200
00:41:34,470 --> 00:41:36,240
door and just go online for hours

1201
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:36,420
in the

1202
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:36,810
phobic

1203
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:39,210
yeah i mean if my mom picked

1204
00:41:39,210 --> 00:41:41,580
up she didn't understand yeah truly was

1205
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:42,900
like we were getting away with something

1206
00:41:43,170 --> 00:41:44,280
and we were so obsessed and if

1207
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:45,840
i couldn't be on it was stressful

1208
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:47,070
like if we are going once we

1209
00:41:47,070 --> 00:41:47,970
go to a friend's house and they

1210
00:41:47,970 --> 00:41:49,470
had only been gone yeah so it's

1211
00:41:49,470 --> 00:41:51,930
like this huge obsession and i think

1212
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:53,400
the second i had that i wanted

1213
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:54,360
it all the time so i do

1214
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:55,800
think if i knew i could be

1215
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,780
on it was but but now if

1216
00:41:57,780 --> 00:41:58,050
he really

1217
00:41:58,110 --> 00:42:01,020
hard so so now if you were

1218
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:02,190
to go back into the nineties and

1219
00:42:02,190 --> 00:42:05,670
still keep your consciousness than you would

1220
00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:06,840
first of all you would the internet

1221
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:08,040
wouldn't be interesting because it would be

1222
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:09,990
so slow compared to what you're used

1223
00:42:09,990 --> 00:42:11,910
to anyone would be like i'm just

1224
00:42:11,910 --> 00:42:12,960
going to wait until it catches up

1225
00:42:13,110 --> 00:42:14,640
like i think about when iphones were

1226
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:18,240
first invented ten or so years

1227
00:42:18,390 --> 00:42:19,770
in twelve years ago or so um

1228
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,750
um how slow they were then and

1229
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:23,640
how late clunky they were like it

1230
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:25,230
would just be so frustrating but you

1231
00:42:25,230 --> 00:42:27,720
seemed amazing so i wonder if i

1232
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:29,940
wonder though also never like eight hundred

1233
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:31,710
dollars or something stuff that's that was

1234
00:42:31,710 --> 00:42:32,910
on tv back down there were a

1235
00:42:32,910 --> 00:42:35,520
mere thousand say wait there's still that

1236
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:36,810
much money but all the stuff that

1237
00:42:36,810 --> 00:42:38,310
was on tv back then you're not

1238
00:42:38,310 --> 00:42:38,400
in

1239
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,350
listed in an a more so you

1240
00:42:40,350 --> 00:42:42,120
wouldn't rewatch it so you would spend

1241
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:43,830
your time oh god i'd be bored

1242
00:42:43,830 --> 00:42:44,940
out of my fucking head but you

1243
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:46,650
would spend your time doing interesting things

1244
00:42:46,650 --> 00:42:48,090
like do it like i don't know

1245
00:42:48,090 --> 00:42:50,970
writing or maybe more traveling or you

1246
00:42:50,970 --> 00:42:51,810
know what i mean like you wouldn't

1247
00:42:51,810 --> 00:42:53,460
be so but also wouldn't you have

1248
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:57,390
to fuckin hide your adulthood like you

1249
00:42:57,420 --> 00:42:58,560
yeah well like

1250
00:42:58,620 --> 00:43:00,720
too hard with last grade a little

1251
00:43:00,750 --> 00:43:02,340
notice this is a quad in the

1252
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:05,700
x-band but hey x man jesus really

1253
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:07,410
want to come out good chris come

1254
00:43:07,410 --> 00:43:09,540
on over here here's my here's my

1255
00:43:09,570 --> 00:43:12,090
pitch on this question okay let's say

1256
00:43:12,150 --> 00:43:13,650
you go back in time to like

1257
00:43:13,650 --> 00:43:15,960
it's like back to the future and

1258
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:17,640
you're you have your so going buddy

1259
00:43:17,670 --> 00:43:18,540
in time

1260
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:20,250
yeah you're basically an adult in a

1261
00:43:20,250 --> 00:43:22,140
different era right so you know all

1262
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:24,360
this shit like i think he was

1263
00:43:24,573 --> 00:43:28,560
stressed by that right well see i

1264
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:31,050
think marty mcfly in my opinion

1265
00:43:32,190 --> 00:43:33,300
when he went back to the fifties

1266
00:43:33,330 --> 00:43:34,740
i don't know that that much was

1267
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:36,690
different from the eighties to the fifties

1268
00:43:36,713 --> 00:43:38,550
other than like he couldn't get a

1269
00:43:38,550 --> 00:43:40,560
pepsi free you had to pay for

1270
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:44,700
it um no didn't ask for a

1271
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:47,204
tab tab if you gotta order something

1272
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:48,330
if you want it by the way

1273
00:43:48,390 --> 00:43:49,470
no one was drinking tab by that

1274
00:43:49,470 --> 00:43:52,170
point and that was my impression from

1275
00:43:52,170 --> 00:43:52,320
my

1276
00:43:52,368 --> 00:43:54,270
entire tb to be in the movie

1277
00:43:54,270 --> 00:43:55,230
and then it was out of business

1278
00:43:55,230 --> 00:43:57,723
within a year right tab was huge

1279
00:43:57,723 --> 00:44:00,000
and my house was it with us

1280
00:44:00,090 --> 00:44:01,830
huh interesting i remember it from when

1281
00:44:01,830 --> 00:44:03,060
i was a little kid but then

1282
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:04,230
i remember when it was it was

1283
00:44:04,230 --> 00:44:05,970
forced to go away because of no

1284
00:44:05,970 --> 00:44:07,860
my mom kept forever whatever was in

1285
00:44:07,860 --> 00:44:09,390
it and then switch to diet coke

1286
00:44:09,390 --> 00:44:10,710
but i think my dad was talking

1287
00:44:10,710 --> 00:44:12,480
about how nostalgia is

1288
00:44:12,510 --> 00:44:15,660
is sort of it's it's a trap

1289
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:17,010
in a way because you feel very

1290
00:44:17,250 --> 00:44:19,110
ill like when you grow to get

1291
00:44:19,110 --> 00:44:21,540
old you feel nostalgic to wear to

1292
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:23,220
the way things were when you were

1293
00:44:23,220 --> 00:44:25,650
young like how little traffic there was

1294
00:44:25,650 --> 00:44:28,380
compared to row or how less yielding

1295
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:30,120
know at the time what it was

1296
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:32,370
you couldn't roy yet but but if

1297
00:44:32,370 --> 00:44:32,640
you were

1298
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:34,950
went back there now would it would

1299
00:44:34,950 --> 00:44:36,935
it be like wonderful of like oh

1300
00:44:36,935 --> 00:44:38,880
wow look there's no traffic like the

1301
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:40,380
parts of it would be so cool

1302
00:44:40,590 --> 00:44:42,375
but then the other parts just just

1303
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:45,240
be like if you tried to force

1304
00:44:45,270 --> 00:44:48,330
enjoyment of things now like this amount

1305
00:44:48,330 --> 00:44:50,760
of traffic if it gets better than

1306
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:52,590
later than this i won't like it

1307
00:44:52,650 --> 00:44:52,800
but

1308
00:44:52,830 --> 00:44:55,290
this is fine when covered for starting

1309
00:44:55,590 --> 00:44:57,180
no tribe member driving around it was

1310
00:44:57,180 --> 00:44:59,340
beautiful it was like arena once upon

1311
00:44:59,354 --> 00:45:00,690
a time in hollywood no it's not

1312
00:45:00,690 --> 00:45:01,980
it's not back up to the normal

1313
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:03,780
levels which no it's still good just

1314
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:05,670
still good but but it wasn't like

1315
00:45:05,670 --> 00:45:07,080
back then where you could get anywhere

1316
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:08,340
in ten minutes you think that there's

1317
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:09,630
going to be a lot less traffic

1318
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:10,860
in the future as people start to

1319
00:45:10,860 --> 00:45:12,870
do more things from home i hope

1320
00:45:12,870 --> 00:45:12,960
so

1321
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,518
so i mean so oh yeah a

1322
00:45:14,518 --> 00:45:16,230
is is not back to the levels

1323
00:45:16,230 --> 00:45:17,850
it once was and i think like

1324
00:45:17,850 --> 00:45:20,160
there's kind of no i've always wondered

1325
00:45:20,490 --> 00:45:23,580
why everyone kept all these offices and

1326
00:45:23,580 --> 00:45:25,440
it's it's purely because like when i

1327
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:28,560
worked at dreamworks animation they would schedule

1328
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,360
you every hour to have a meeting

1329
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:31,860
because they want they're paying you they

1330
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:33,120
wanted you to to

1331
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:34,500
to have meetings and they were always

1332
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:36,810
a waste of time and i every

1333
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:39,150
hour every hour you had to have

1334
00:45:39,150 --> 00:45:40,830
something on the books and so it

1335
00:45:40,830 --> 00:45:41,730
would be like ok we're going to

1336
00:45:41,730 --> 00:45:43,380
have a meeting with the storyboard ist

1337
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:45,030
and it would be like well what

1338
00:45:45,030 --> 00:45:46,860
are why we don't we don't need

1339
00:45:46,860 --> 00:45:48,360
anything it was like well ah we

1340
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:49,890
just need to schedule you for something

1341
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:52,260
that sucks but that's the trap of

1342
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:53,280
like everyone having

1343
00:45:53,310 --> 00:45:55,830
these offices i think people can work

1344
00:45:56,190 --> 00:45:58,560
you know smarter from home anyway we

1345
00:45:58,620 --> 00:45:59,940
yeah we need to take a break

1346
00:46:00,150 --> 00:46:04,020
oh you guys both went to board

1347
00:46:04,020 --> 00:46:05,790
them town where you were fiddling with

1348
00:46:05,790 --> 00:46:07,740
your stuff while i was talking well

1349
00:46:07,770 --> 00:46:09,780
you're the mayor important

1350
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:11,700
alright we'll be right but it wasn't

1351
00:46:11,730 --> 00:46:13,020
what i was just disinterest i know

1352
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:25,860
we're back and the third act of

1353
00:46:25,860 --> 00:46:27,960

1356
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:33,630

wish shipping on spotify got to get

1407
00:48:09,150 --> 00:48:11,040
in touch that's my takeaway thought that

1408
00:48:11,053 --> 00:48:11,700
before then i

1409
00:48:11,792 --> 00:48:14,130
the chinese guys was actually more moving

1410
00:48:14,130 --> 00:48:16,110
than many ira i enjoyed this year's

1411
00:48:16,110 --> 00:48:18,000
emmy and the mean overall i thought

1412
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,010
were really good i enjoyed them although

1413
00:48:20,010 --> 00:48:20,970

1414
00:48:20,970 --> 00:48:22,500
great night honestly i was so happy

1415
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:24,210
i mean like they know what winning

1416
00:48:24,210 --> 00:48:26,850
was a damper on my enjoyment of

00:48:26,910 --> 00:48:30,300
likewise yeah well yeah bojack did not
