how you would categorize what it is

204
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,900
but they're doing these sort of nostalgia

205
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,850
videos where they put on like the

206
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:28,770
exact clothes you're trying a little bit

207
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:30,210
of this it's kind of fun like

208
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,470
i will go in a little wormholes

209
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:32,430
with them because i'm like i had

210
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:33,780
all the fucking clothes that they have

211
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:36,150
it's like very specific a brown shrug

212
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:39,270
with glitter over a tank top three

213
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:39,840
layers of tank

214
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:42,930
tops over like y low rise clans

215
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:44,130
i don't have them now but i

216
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:46,560
had them yeah i was addressed like

217
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:47,910
why did they have the old clothes

218
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:49,560
that's what i wonder how how and

219
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,550
why do they have all the old

220
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:52,890
clothes one person who it's clear that

221
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:55,140
her mom saved everything so she just

222
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:56,700
has all of the stuff it would

223
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,470
be sad if they're buying clothes just

224
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:00,000
to make a video but

225
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,438
but i don't think that's i think

226
00:08:01,438 --> 00:08:03,060
something that people do a lot i

227
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:04,410
think that's joyful i think i think

228
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:05,880
it's sad if you buy clothes just

229
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,860
to wear them you know it sat

230
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,660
close you know etc a billion

231
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:13,650
anyway it was happy nude beach do

the happiest place on earth do you

234
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:17,760
think he'd be interested in a video

235
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,830
of somebody getting ready for their day

236
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:21,360
in the exact way you did when

237
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,040
you were they know

238
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:27,840

239
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,375
drunk before going out to get drunk

240
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:31,560
her you know what i've noticed is

241
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,840
that there's a new thing where people

242
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,300
are like trying on clothes but they

243
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,790
start in their underwear and just feels

244
00:08:38,790 --> 00:08:42,600
like this yeah just to show just

245
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,530
because they want to be in their

246
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:44,400
underwear people are

247
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:46,860
really interesting aren't they and because it's

248
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,720

green not that one not that one

250
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:52,680

252
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:54,390

it longhand on legal pad yeah i

388
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:33,630

00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:34,860
you would write to every to all

390
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:36,570
my information i get it now that

391
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:39,510
you're explaining it magic legal pad and

392
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:40,440
writing appears on it every

393
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,350
i wanna know more about that what

394
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:45,000

in longhand on a legal pad oh

396
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,719
okay i thought he said that somebody's

397
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:50,400
triggered it okay to transcribe it like

398
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,690
reads it aloud and then someone else

399
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:52,890
has to type it or does someone

400
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:54,810
look at the page and type while

401
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:56,130
they're looking at the page good question

402
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,470
cameron manheim was on rosie o'donnell's podcast

403
00:13:58,470 --> 00:13:59,730
and she had a great story about

404
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:00,630
being cast real

405
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:02,010

407
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:05,520
then has really been on cameron's podcast

408
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:08,670
yet this cameron well i don't think

409
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:10,260
she does but she loves games learn

410
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:12,960
that but she would had a great

411
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,790
stir up being cast on um whatever

412
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:17,790

425
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:42,810
podcast people having podcasts which we were

426
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,610
ever if you're talking about anyone you're

427
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:47,791
speaking about people having podcasts i just

428
00:14:47,791 --> 00:14:47,970
thought

429
00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:50,130
i just got into the

430
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:52,410
rice

431
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:55,650
i just got into the doctor and

432
00:14:55,650 --> 00:14:56,940
they did the tiny taps on my

433
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:58,590
eye what the fuck are you talking

434
00:14:58,590 --> 00:15:00,780
about you know like that does the

435
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:03,360
oh like oh my test it's what

436
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,740
does it test the eye strength or

437
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:06,210
something like them to just tiny taps

438
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:07,139
i think we've been over this and

439
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:08,700
we know what the blogger talking know

440
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:11,730
it it you can't it's they're imperceptible

441
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:13,230
oh yeah other than a vague that

442
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:13,530
no no

443
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:14,460
it's a little thing they put by

444
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:16,320
your eye and goes yeah yeah and

445
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,130
it's like uniquely on a new test

446
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:21,660
because they actually got rid of the

447
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:23,610
glaucoma tests okay we're used to look

448
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:24,780

457
00:15:39,873 --> 00:15:41,700
into the supermarket to grab a cup

458
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:43,530
that's not normal for you it was

459
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:45,300
right next to the ida okay and

460
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:47,580
i was behind these two women and

461
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:49,140
they were walking dogs and they were

462
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:50,550
like and one was like oh by

463
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:52,230
the way i was wondering if we

464
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:53,784
should do a podcast together

465
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:57,330
whoa you should turn running on na

466
00:15:57,330 --> 00:15:58,470
i was like oh get out of

467
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:01,020
my space and other one was like

468
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:03,300
yeah sure yeah you gotta be a

469
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:05,100
little more excited and i know of

470
00:16:05,128 --> 00:16:06,720
voice than that no premise by the

471
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,760
way they never talked about the poker

472
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:11,190
hey it was supposed to do both

473
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:13,500
walk dogs oh there is no it

474
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,070
was not like

475
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:16,260
the walkout supermarket that's our podcast it

476
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:17,690
was not a podcast about like hey

477
00:16:17,813 --> 00:16:19,110
i was thinking we should do a

478
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:20,459
podcast about this or whatever it was

479
00:16:20,459 --> 00:16:21,720
just purely like we need to have

480
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,010
a podcast it was like a business

481
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:24,390
decision yeah and she was like because

482
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:25,440
i was thinking about someone that i

483
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,640
might want to be in business with

484
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:29,250
for years and years and and you

485
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,620
came to mind it was like i'm

486
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:33,870
sorry for the wrong reasons people go

487
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:34,150
to these

488
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:35,910
weird workshops and they're told to do

489
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:37,920
things and then they end up having

490
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,620
business minded goals with their friends groin

491
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:42,060
set but listen you're telling me you

492
00:16:42,090 --> 00:16:44,220
know i thought about people you've never

493
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:46,290
thought like i wish i like who

494
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,490
can i go into business with for

495
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:48,990
years and years years because like what

496
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:50,160
i i think like when i meet

497
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,170
someone yeah so like i kind of

498
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:53,550
do this thing like my brain first

499
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:54,390
goes like are they my friend

500
00:16:54,464 --> 00:16:56,310
i go numerous top setup yeah can

501
00:16:56,310 --> 00:16:58,260
you go into business like years or

502
00:16:58,268 --> 00:16:59,970
years in your yeah and then i

503
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:02,131
really think about that and sometimes it's

504
00:17:02,131 --> 00:17:03,720
the essences to know but even that

505
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,190
will determine whether i get the coffee

506
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:09,540
i remember that was when i when

507
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:11,640
janey were getting serious about each other

508
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:14,310
well during yeah starting with the podcast

509
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:16,020
we've been married for ten years yeah

510
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:17,220
when you guys see if hawkins is

511
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:18,000

00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:23,310
now yeah so i went out here's

514
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:25,170
another story and these are slight stories

515
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:26,550

516
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:29,010
maybelline's to all now i have to

517
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:31,860

already talking from that why no we

519
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:36,420
don't need another one i can't say

520
00:17:36,427 --> 00:17:37,890
this is not a smother one no

521
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,570
see this is not a story it

522
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:40,920
doesn't even qualify as a story so

523
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:42,270
i don't write wow

524
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:43,320
don't wanna say it and then you

525
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,550
guys go like why did you bother

526
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:46,020
with but then you actually did start

527
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:47,957
off by saying here's a story yeah

528
00:17:47,996 --> 00:17:50,190
this is the greatest story oh so

529
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:51,690
i go to albertsons and i'm i'm

530
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:54,480
behind this this woman who honestly thinks

00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:02,550
some ways is wearing like really shy

534
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:04,740
short shorts and dark dark sunglasses and

535
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:08,816

536
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:11,790
even from from everybody loves me was

537
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:15,690

560
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:06,120
was like pre-packaged meals don't tribbles

561
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,760
i've done chips because the lunchables is

562
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:10,980
for clearly for kids and then there's

563
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:13,920

759
00:26:05,485 --> 00:26:06,715
be like here's a couple of bucks

760
00:26:06,985 --> 00:26:09,175
now it's ten bucks per over sanders

761
00:26:09,175 --> 00:26:10,585
ten dollars so it's like why would

762
00:26:10,585 --> 00:26:12,565
you ever offer to pay anything for

763
00:26:12,565 --> 00:26:15,265

767
00:26:20,246 --> 00:26:21,805
run fast he had the same powers

768
00:26:21,835 --> 00:26:23,203
he he would have to run backwards

769
00:26:23,215 --> 00:26:24,385
oh no

770
00:26:26,035 --> 00:26:27,325

i adults before i do it it's

785
00:27:02,065 --> 00:27:03,805
not bad thank you although i feel

786
00:27:03,805 --> 00:27:05,275
like it's tipping people off to the

787
00:27:05,275 --> 00:27:06,895
fact that you're going to indulge like

788
00:27:06,925 --> 00:27:08,605
i don't always have to do it

789
00:27:09,325 --> 00:27:11,095
so you are you doing false flag

790
00:27:11,095 --> 00:27:12,985
dodges yeah all the time you're just

791
00:27:12,985 --> 00:27:14,785
yelling dolls and the not dodging yeah

792
00:27:14,815 --> 00:27:17,095
and credit theaters oh not in crowded

793
00:27:17,125 --> 00:27:20,485
theatres yeah what about you

794
00:27:20,485 --> 00:27:22,555
yelling fire in a theater that's not

795
00:27:22,585 --> 00:27:23,905
right that has like ten people in

796
00:27:23,905 --> 00:27:25,555
it that's cool i think it's allowed

797
00:27:25,555 --> 00:27:27,685
of course yeah it's just the stampede

798
00:27:27,685 --> 00:27:30,325
factor it is the stampede factor that's

799
00:27:30,325 --> 00:27:31,495
what they're worried about so if it's

800
00:27:31,525 --> 00:27:33,745
if it's under capacity and it's ten

801
00:27:33,745 --> 00:27:35,575
people can get out fine but yeah

802
00:27:35,605 --> 00:27:38,186
why why isn't capacity ok here's capacity

803
00:27:38,186 --> 00:27:40,615
in theaters should be low

804
00:27:40,675 --> 00:27:43,435
enough to where someone yells fire people

805
00:27:43,435 --> 00:27:46,075
get out safely yeah all theaters should

806
00:27:46,105 --> 00:27:46,585
have

807
00:27:47,605 --> 00:27:50,065

much would you pay my i paid

963
00:33:40,195 --> 00:33:41,755
eleven dollars because my friend is a

964
00:33:41,755 --> 00:33:43,285
stubs member and we went to a

965
00:33:43,285 --> 00:33:45,955
matinee and our school is she she

966
00:33:45,955 --> 00:33:47,305
got all the tickets she got in

967
00:33:47,305 --> 00:33:48,805
for free and then you guys split

968
00:33:48,805 --> 00:33:51,745
the free well if your stubs member

969
00:33:51,745 --> 00:33:54,116

970
00:33:54,116 --> 00:33:55,705
your free movies for life yeah we

971
00:33:55,798 --> 00:33:57,385
got a discount from it for life

972
00:33:58,195 --> 00:33:59,995
so who's you pay there was that

973
00:34:00,055 --> 00:34:01,315
it's a one time fee there was

974
00:34:01,315 --> 00:34:02,485

1110
00:38:49,555 --> 00:38:50,755

1127
00:39:21,955 --> 00:39:25,585

00:39:28,435 --> 00:39:31,615
along to break apps like get the

1131
00:39:31,615 --> 00:39:33,325
deal look you're already a level of

1132
00:39:33,325 --> 00:39:36,805
fame but we'll never so no one's

1133
00:39:36,805 --> 00:39:37,015

is a big deal what we have

1501
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:56,070
going on here today it's not something

1502
00:52:56,070 --> 00:52:57,561
that we want to be talking about

1503
00:52:57,561 --> 00:52:57,930
but the same

1504
00:52:57,960 --> 00:52:59,040
time we need to address just get

1505
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:00,780
ahead of it so whatever questions you

00:53:00,780 --> 00:53:02,340
have we are going to allow them

1507
00:53:02,370 --> 00:53:04,770
is this going to affect his ah

1508
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:08,700
educational shows at all um you know

1509
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:10,740
what we're really hoping not he's he

1510
00:53:10,740 --> 00:53:12,180
didn't intend for any of this to

1511
00:53:12,180 --> 00:53:15,810
happen say think that what he said

1512
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:18,060
just sounds very integrity intentional which

1513
00:53:18,090 --> 00:53:19,680
part of what was sorry yeah do

1514
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:21,180
you think this is going to destroy

1515
00:53:21,210 --> 00:53:24,210
his credibility i see i think the

1516
00:53:24,210 --> 00:53:26,880
fans know his true his true soul

1517
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:28,650
and history nature i mean he has

1518
00:53:28,650 --> 00:53:29,820
been doing this for such a long

1519
00:53:29,820 --> 00:53:31,290
time but i do i feel like

1520
00:53:31,290 --> 00:53:32,880
the fans are the ones who has

1521
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:34,080
trust is like a slap in the

1522
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:35,130
face to the fans for him to

1523
00:53:35,130 --> 00:53:36,810
say something like this right so i'm

1524
00:53:36,810 --> 00:53:38,250
not sure exactly which part you're speak

1525
00:53:38,250 --> 00:53:39,300
thing about because there are a couple

1526
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:41,010
things he has apologized it was a

1527
00:53:41,010 --> 00:53:43,950
very brief statement it wasn't not not

1528
00:53:43,950 --> 00:53:45,120
a lot of fat on that half

1529
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:47,190
of it was very contradictory to everything

1530
00:53:47,190 --> 00:53:49,410
we know about the world and then

1531
00:53:49,410 --> 00:53:50,730
the second half was just an insult

1532
00:53:50,738 --> 00:53:53,730
slab so you're saying bill nye said

1533
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:55,890
the world is flat you idiots well

1534
00:53:56,220 --> 00:53:57,600
yes i mean i mean the second

1535
00:53:57,600 --> 00:53:58,410
part of what he said

1536
00:53:58,470 --> 00:54:00,030
you can try to paraphrase it now

1537
00:54:00,210 --> 00:54:01,770
but i we we have it on

1538
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:03,150
we haven't on t i mean he

1539
00:54:03,150 --> 00:54:05,430
likened that condition

1540
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:07,740
two the only want to say to

1541
00:54:07,740 --> 00:54:11,370
the status of the cup size of

1542
00:54:12,990 --> 00:54:14,880
so bill nye said the world is

1543
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:18,510
as flat as like as joan rivers

1544
00:54:18,510 --> 00:54:21,180
tits joan rivers know someone more personal

1545
00:54:21,180 --> 00:54:23,760
to me yeah your wife's tits oh

00:54:23,790 --> 00:54:26,548

1547
00:54:26,548 --> 00:54:28,200

1548
00:54:29,790 --> 00:54:31,320

00:54:31,350 --> 00:54:33,810
that ah i used to be very

1550
00:54:33,810 --> 00:54:37,320
intimate with those breasts your mom yes

1551
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:39,690
so bill nye said the world is

00:54:41,490 --> 00:54:44,070

best of my ability great um look

1599
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:34,860
what did what did her the people

1600
00:56:34,860 --> 00:56:37,770
she works with think about this well

1601
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:39,210
honestly um

1602
00:56:39,390 --> 00:56:42,720
obviously that an academy award winner doesn't

1603
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:45,690
want to be associated with with this

1604
00:56:45,690 --> 00:56:48,210
kind of thing you know it well

1605
00:56:48,270 --> 00:56:50,040
what the person she works with oh

1606
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:52,680
okay yeah she herself has not won

1607
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:53,880
an academy award it wouldn't make any

1608
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:55,620
sense for her to win one no

1609
00:56:55,650 --> 00:56:57,420
but because you asked a question because

1610
00:56:57,420 --> 00:56:59,340
i really wish all these people

1611
00:56:59,370 --> 00:57:01,470
that that she is on this show

1612
00:57:01,470 --> 00:57:03,990
with yeah academy award on a show

1613
00:57:03,990 --> 00:57:06,480
with with with these different women with

1614
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:08,670
these different thoughts and it's like they're

1615
00:57:08,670 --> 00:57:11,190
all gonna have suddenly have outsized this

1616
00:57:11,250 --> 00:57:13,050
kind of ah this kind of activity

1617
00:57:13,260 --> 00:57:15,360
okay well look i mean ah they're

1618
00:57:15,390 --> 00:57:18,390
obviously a cast as a family and

1619
00:57:18,690 --> 00:57:19,440
they um

1620
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:21,900
they all can be different people but

1621
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:24,810
still it's working together something like that

1622
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:28,440
i imagine that one of her cohosts

1623
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:29,610
is going to have a problem with

1624
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:32,730
with her eating that yeah well just

1625
00:57:32,730 --> 00:57:35,130
because i mean look we've all seen

1626
00:57:35,220 --> 00:57:38,910
a female trouble and divine human shit

1627
00:57:39,300 --> 00:57:41,010
so so so it's not worse than

1628
00:57:41,010 --> 00:57:42,090
that and that's what you're trying to

1629
00:57:42,090 --> 00:57:44,070
zach thanks that's pretty good maybe worse

1630
00:57:44,070 --> 00:57:46,071
because it's not ah because he

1631
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:48,570
we tend to eat yeah and it's

1632
00:57:48,570 --> 00:57:50,310
and it's actually an human shit is

1633
00:57:51,450 --> 00:57:53,910
just gotta point alright let's let her

1634
00:57:53,910 --> 00:57:54,030
off

1635
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:57,150
okay i mean i don't even know

1636
00:57:57,150 --> 00:57:58,829
how she got the meat honest is

1637
00:57:58,860 --> 00:58:00,030
it mean is it fit how did

1638
00:58:00,030 --> 00:58:02,940

1646
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:23,130
he shows she she she did once

1647
00:58:23,130 --> 00:58:25,620
all women and anyway she'd all the

1648
00:58:25,620 --> 00:58:27,210
women she works with she's not gonna

1649
00:58:27,210 --> 00:58:28,650
like that she's very opinionated and they're

1650
00:58:28,650 --> 00:58:30,090
all very opinionated in different direction i

1651
00:58:30,090 --> 00:58:31,470
mean i think one of them might

1652
00:58:31,590 --> 00:58:34,440
there her political leanings might lean towards

1653
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:37,440
where she doesn't care but look but

1654
00:58:37,470 --> 00:58:39,300
an arab majority get on tv

1655
00:58:39,450 --> 00:58:41,190
authorities speak about things if they there's

1656
00:58:41,190 --> 00:58:41,940
no way that they're gonna be able

1657
00:58:41,940 --> 00:58:44,070
to not talk about you know this

1658
00:58:44,100 --> 00:58:45,300
big talk about what's in the news

1659
00:58:45,300 --> 00:58:47,610
this is in the news now yes

1660
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:49,860
they do and sometimes they accidentally are

1661
00:58:49,860 --> 00:58:53,490
the news and if joy bahar know

1662
00:58:53,490 --> 00:58:55,800
because if deceased

1663
00:58:57,540 --> 00:58:59,160
if barbara walters um

1664
00:59:00,060 --> 00:59:03,150
says something from beyond the grave she

1665
00:59:03,150 --> 00:59:04,440
didn't say something she

1666
00:59:05,610 --> 00:59:07,290
she said she said grace before she

1667
00:59:07,290 --> 00:59:09,360
ate this thing yeah yeah well i

1668
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:10,890
mean that is a mitigating factor you're

1669
00:59:10,890 --> 00:59:13,860
right yes and just because it was

1670
00:59:15,660 --> 00:59:16,867
it was i mean i mean it's

1671
00:59:16,867 --> 00:59:19,650
just we we hate tuna the thing

1672
00:59:19,650 --> 00:59:21,360
she ate was was a former star

1673
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:24,600
of a tv show itself yeah we

1674
00:59:24,630 --> 00:59:26,220
i mean the the show that has

1675
00:59:26,220 --> 00:59:28,470
the name that is the start of

1676
00:59:28,860 --> 00:59:31,290
describing someone giving someone the middle finger

1677
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:31,710
yeah

1678
00:59:36,870 --> 00:59:39,780
flipper off yeah okay

1679
00:59:41,640 --> 00:59:44,070
ah if you classify dolphin as meat

1680
00:59:44,130 --> 00:59:45,210
then of course you're going to see

1681
00:59:45,210 --> 00:59:48,570
this in a certain negative light but

1682
00:59:48,570 --> 00:59:50,460
if you just classified often as fish

1683
00:59:51,060 --> 00:59:52,740
ah then it's not the big deal

1684
00:59:52,740 --> 00:59:53,940
is it i guess he's got barbara

1685
00:59:53,940 --> 00:59:56,640
walters eats dolphin live on camera live

1686
00:59:56,640 --> 00:59:58,920
on camera i mean she had a

1687
00:59:58,920 --> 01:00:00,660
reason to do it what was the

1688
01:00:00,660 --> 01:00:01,050
reason

1689
01:00:01,590 --> 01:00:03,600
she wanted people to see how fancy

1690
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:04,920

1691
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:05,490
