1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:00,510

00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:18,000
me yeah and that's what our theme

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,040

you can't ask these questions years in

13
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:38,495
something because our energy up yeah yeah

i don't think real present centers us

15
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:42,360

three of us started doing this podcast

89
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:17,340
many years ago is we're all comedians

90
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:19,260
we all went on the comedy bang

91
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:21,420
bang live tour back in what year

92
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:24,330
was that even twenty twenty sixteen we

93
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:25,920
we did every show together we travel

94
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,630
old around the country and two different

95
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:29,730
countries we went to australia and canada

96
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:32,100
and england although lauren you didn't go

97
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,600
to england i would have had a

98
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:36,390
nasal surgery on my deviated septum that

99
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:38,550
was causing slug like blood to leave

100
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:38,850
my

101
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:42,809
from a national not enough blood is

102
00:03:42,809 --> 00:03:44,430
slug like it was just you know

103
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:45,480
i was scared to get on a

104
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,220
plane and have that start happening it's

105
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:48,870
a big deal yeah so we all

106
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:50,940
struck up a friendship and we decided

107
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:52,980
to do a podcast together you're you're

108
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:55,140
saying we didn't become friends until the

109
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:56,940
tour no i think probably halfway through

110
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:58,290
the tour wow

111
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,270
i think that's true

112
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:03,360
i think i think no we were

113
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,240
already facing a deepening though i know

114
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,100
i saw each other at our glasses

115
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:09,930
i there's no turning back from that

116
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:12,090
i do believe that night two of

117
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:14,040
the tour we everything got real because

118
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,450
guy because actually we were in the

119
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:16,860
middle of two shows in boston and

120
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:18,930
backstage you just like did start downloading

121
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:20,880
my life problems to i think you're

122
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:21,570
like look this is

123
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,830
gonna be a boring tour unless we

124
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:25,080
really get to know each other and

125
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,640
be real with each other sigh there

126
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:28,920
yeah yeah remember this at all i

127
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,570

128
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,330
yes yes anyway so things got real

129
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:35,340

do this we stopped being polite yes

131
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:38,940

00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:40,260
what does this show if you've never

133
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:41,550

friend his wife was pregnant for the

244
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:18,870
first time and she scored as far

245
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:19,230
as he knows

246
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,790
these these secrets you're afraid of and

247
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:25,440
she said to him oh i feel

248
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,480

00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:29,850
oh okay well let's ah let's drive

250
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:32,040
to the hospital they'd like moses she's

251
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:33,990
very calm mosey to the car nothing

252
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:35,640
really weird was happening it was about

253
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,260
a twenty minute drive they drove twenty

254
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:39,600
minutes they arrived they walked into the

255
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,560
door she had the baby

256
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:43,590
be immediately wow just like k so

257
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:45,480
lucky like bobby of the hospital i

258
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:46,980
practically yeah she just went oh i

259
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:49,290
think and then they they she just

260
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:51,270
said like wow it looks like a

261
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:52,740
tv show where like you where you

262
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:53,850
get cut off in the writing and

263
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:55,410
you just you you'll keep talking like

264
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:56,880
oh i think and then the baby

265
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:57,870
comes out it's like i guess i

266
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,910
can't finish my sentence like she was

267
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:00,720
gonna say i think i'm

268
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:02,010
having the baby but it's like guess

269
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:03,750
like you know when the shows were

270
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,520
like they write it where it's like

271
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,080
you're like no no no i'm trying

272
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,400
to explain and the person just talks

273
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,330
over you so you don't get it

274
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:10,230
out and i'm like yeah if you

275
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:11,790
just kept talking they would have to

276
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:14,490
hear your explanation that would make sense

277
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:16,560
and then you the cheapest way because

278
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:19,200
the the the drama is essentially people

279
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,880
keeping secrets from from each other

280
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:22,830
and so it's the cheapest way when

281
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:24,607
someone when a character is like hey

282
00:09:24,699 --> 00:09:26,580
i wanna tell you this thing and

283
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:28,460
then someone interrupts i'm always frustrating yeah

284
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,580
cause i'm like oh it's so cheap

285
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:31,560
let's circle back at lee yeah it's

286
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,150
like what are the secrets they're keeping

287
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:34,980
from each other and like eight is

288
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:37,320
enough well there's nine of them i

289
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,250
don't know if you knew that is

290
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:40,050
enough is not a drama exit what

291
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:41,040
would you classify at us

292
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:42,840
he's an aid is enough oh no

293
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,950
i'm thinking just the ten of us

294
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,350
by the way this is a big

295
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:48,600
part of three days holiday knowing shows

296
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,130
from the seventy that's right and lower

297
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:52,560
knowing shows from the abcs hey i

298
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,970
guess eighty yeah because we're not that

299
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:55,770
far we shouldn't meet in the e

300
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,560

ah i didn't watch family matters but

305
00:10:07,795 --> 00:10:09,235

306
00:10:09,295 --> 00:10:10,885

00:10:13,075 --> 00:10:15,295

yeah they are family matters thank you

313
00:10:23,275 --> 00:10:25,465
yeah they gave me such a platform

314
00:10:25,465 --> 00:10:25,915
to say that

315
00:10:26,185 --> 00:10:27,925
so anyway laura and i haven't had

316
00:10:27,925 --> 00:10:29,725
a chance to say to you congratulations

317
00:10:29,755 --> 00:10:31,225
oh thanks so you didn't ignore me

318
00:10:31,225 --> 00:10:32,695
when we started till there every time

319
00:10:32,785 --> 00:10:34,885
since this has happened um but that's

320
00:10:34,885 --> 00:10:36,325
so cool if you said it i

321
00:10:36,325 --> 00:10:38,095

for you it's great why are you

00:10:42,385 --> 00:10:44,485
withholding with your congratulations i think that's

325
00:10:44,485 --> 00:10:45,955
a sacred thing and

326
00:10:46,195 --> 00:10:47,035
i don't think you should just like

327
00:10:47,035 --> 00:10:48,085
spread it around like well so you

328
00:10:48,085 --> 00:10:49,645
don't think this deserves it that's fine

329
00:10:49,885 --> 00:10:51,535
and it's on the line it's a

330
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:53,575

way in the middle of this in

339
00:11:11,095 --> 00:11:12,745

340
00:11:12,775 --> 00:11:15,025

00:11:20,725 --> 00:11:23,005
banking the episodes ahead of time yeah

345
00:11:23,035 --> 00:11:24,685

a there i don't know fred guinness

412
00:13:38,455 --> 00:13:40,465
knows this but there's a lot of

413
00:13:40,465 --> 00:13:42,895
controversy whether that is fred guinness i'd

414
00:13:42,895 --> 00:13:44,365
never mind ah that's a different show

415
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:46,255
but anyway there's a lot of controversy

416
00:13:46,285 --> 00:13:47,875
as to whether that is a writer

417
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:49,255
that bobby might not have been that

418
00:13:49,255 --> 00:13:51,535
old but so that's a lie it's

419
00:13:51,535 --> 00:13:54,205
kind of a munchausen situation do you

420
00:13:54,205 --> 00:13:54,595
know what that

421
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:54,895
means

422
00:13:56,185 --> 00:13:58,405
well like i do know that with

423
00:13:58,435 --> 00:13:58,705
the

424
00:14:00,865 --> 00:14:02,274
a young person had a dog who

425
00:14:02,274 --> 00:14:04,975
was old by proxy learns that that's

426
00:14:05,005 --> 00:14:07,015
with such you mean to ally even

427
00:14:07,345 --> 00:14:08,935
really soaking up a lot of gypsy

428
00:14:08,935 --> 00:14:13,129
rose data recently and enemies regular chosen

429
00:14:13,129 --> 00:14:16,255
syndrome that she was younger than she

430
00:14:16,255 --> 00:14:17,725
was right so i just was kind

431
00:14:17,725 --> 00:14:18,955
of playing off of that that her

432
00:14:18,955 --> 00:14:20,005
age this dog's age

433
00:14:20,035 --> 00:14:21,685
was a mystery given the parents were

434
00:14:21,685 --> 00:14:22,941
saying oh she's old she's all the

435
00:14:22,941 --> 00:14:24,475
whole time she was young how does

436
00:14:24,475 --> 00:14:25,765
this fit in with the mysterious case

437
00:14:25,765 --> 00:14:27,625
i'm gonna tell you grace i have

438
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:28,705
to catch up there was an update

439
00:14:28,705 --> 00:14:29,905
on that they haven't caught up ah

440
00:14:29,965 --> 00:14:32,005
yeah it's horrible by the way that

441
00:14:32,005 --> 00:14:34,705
whole situation is so dark yeah um

442
00:14:34,705 --> 00:14:35,785
i don't know what it is oh

443
00:14:35,845 --> 00:14:36,895
i don't want to explain it it

444
00:14:36,895 --> 00:14:38,815
rhymes though so it sounds whimsical yeah

445
00:14:38,815 --> 00:14:39,895
you can google that if you care

446
00:14:40,015 --> 00:14:40,195
okay

447
00:14:40,195 --> 00:14:43,135
a bluey bluey is sweet and they

448
00:14:43,135 --> 00:14:44,485
had a pop up house which i

449
00:14:44,485 --> 00:14:45,625
think is still a thing it's it's

450
00:14:45,655 --> 00:14:47,515
moving to chicago soon kinda going up

451
00:14:47,695 --> 00:14:49,195
yeah it's going all over the us

452
00:14:49,195 --> 00:14:50,635
and maybe also because it felt like

453
00:14:50,635 --> 00:14:53,485
people from australia were there like guiding

454
00:14:53,485 --> 00:14:54,985
it yeah a couple of the people

455
00:14:54,985 --> 00:14:56,425
in charge seem oh i didn't catch

456
00:14:56,425 --> 00:14:58,975
that um but so is that it's

457
00:14:58,975 --> 00:15:00,355
basically an immersive experience

458
00:15:00,355 --> 00:15:02,335
that's where you go into blues house

459
00:15:02,335 --> 00:15:04,695
they bring the house from the cartoon

460
00:15:04,705 --> 00:15:06,625
to life and it's you know there's

461
00:15:06,625 --> 00:15:09,535
a kitchen and a television room and

462
00:15:09,565 --> 00:15:11,905
and play houses and bedrooms and all

463
00:15:11,905 --> 00:15:12,835
this kind of and then when you

464
00:15:12,835 --> 00:15:14,125
walk in they say well first of

465
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:15,235

believe me

470
00:15:20,875 --> 00:15:22,165
what i didn't realize is they don't

471
00:15:22,165 --> 00:15:23,545
you don't and you get shot so

472
00:15:23,545 --> 00:15:24,653
that was a huge mistake but yeah

473
00:15:24,685 --> 00:15:26,605
huge i say how secondly i mean

474
00:15:26,605 --> 00:15:27,685

476
00:15:29,065 --> 00:15:30,895

she wanted to find bluey immediately she

533
00:17:09,895 --> 00:17:11,545
was focused on the task they said

534
00:17:11,665 --> 00:17:13,435
you go new item and she likes

535
00:17:13,435 --> 00:17:14,725
hide and seek she's like let's go

536
00:17:14,725 --> 00:17:16,795

537
00:17:16,885 --> 00:17:18,295
are they and she was having some

538
00:17:18,295 --> 00:17:19,975
of them should go we have to

539
00:17:20,065 --> 00:17:22,315
find them where she's going to have

540
00:17:22,345 --> 00:17:24,055
it's a forty five minute thing too

541
00:17:24,055 --> 00:17:25,795
and they're not prepared to have bluey

542
00:17:25,795 --> 00:17:27,805
come out to see you until the

543
00:17:27,805 --> 00:17:29,155
end of it so she was getting

544
00:17:29,185 --> 00:17:30,955
a little frustrated five minutes is a

545
00:17:30,955 --> 00:17:32,845
lot i mean y'all just want a

546
00:17:32,845 --> 00:17:35,215
few louis comes out there slides forty

547
00:17:35,215 --> 00:17:37,255
five point solid solid that's too long

548
00:17:37,285 --> 00:17:38,905
i actually agree i felt that you

549
00:17:38,905 --> 00:17:40,195
should get to end it when

550
00:17:40,226 --> 00:17:41,485
you want to end it i didn't

551
00:17:41,485 --> 00:17:43,707
think that writes that setup is yeah

552
00:17:43,707 --> 00:17:45,376
that's ridiculous because i was like she

553
00:17:45,415 --> 00:17:47,395
never was on board at a certain

554
00:17:47,395 --> 00:17:49,135
point like she really wanted to find

555
00:17:49,135 --> 00:17:51,655
them on a fifteen minute though rotation

556
00:17:51,655 --> 00:17:54,355
where right where they take people out

557
00:17:54,355 --> 00:17:56,245
after forty five minutes and then every

558
00:17:56,245 --> 00:17:57,805
fifteen minutes a new group comes in

559
00:17:57,805 --> 00:18:00,055
and they feel released in a private

560
00:18:00,055 --> 00:18:00,355
room

561
00:18:00,355 --> 00:18:02,005
lm yeah where do you take pictures

562
00:18:02,005 --> 00:18:03,085
and stuff like that which was very

563
00:18:03,085 --> 00:18:04,885
cute yeah um so whole thing was

564
00:18:05,185 --> 00:18:06,387
she had a great time i think

565
00:18:06,387 --> 00:18:07,645
thought like it was stressful a little

566
00:18:07,645 --> 00:18:10,315
bit my child emerald was didn't she

567
00:18:10,345 --> 00:18:12,445
she she knows what blue he is

568
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:14,905
she really loves the theme song and

569
00:18:14,905 --> 00:18:16,915
that's like she'll watch it maybe but

570
00:18:16,915 --> 00:18:18,355
not knowing what's happening but she loves

571
00:18:18,355 --> 00:18:19,765
the theme song yeah so i think

572
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:20,515
she was just happy

573
00:18:20,545 --> 00:18:21,355
to be in a place where there

574
00:18:21,355 --> 00:18:23,245
were slides and there were like choices

575
00:18:23,245 --> 00:18:24,921
to play and stuff like that they

576
00:18:24,921 --> 00:18:27,475
they they have like dance contests and

577
00:18:27,475 --> 00:18:29,155
stuff like that like it's it certainly

578
00:18:29,155 --> 00:18:30,535
there's a lot going on state away

579
00:18:30,535 --> 00:18:32,185
from that but i do think that

580
00:18:32,245 --> 00:18:33,775
the holly why are you so ashamed

581
00:18:33,775 --> 00:18:35,815
of your dancing just was like you're

582
00:18:36,265 --> 00:18:38,005
you know it just felt cody because

583
00:18:38,005 --> 00:18:40,675
i dropped like a ballerina i'm

584
00:18:40,795 --> 00:18:43,525
a beautiful dancer prima ballerina yeah but

585
00:18:43,555 --> 00:18:45,145
i lost one that time you've done

586
00:18:45,145 --> 00:18:46,645
all the major roles before you're twenty

587
00:18:46,645 --> 00:18:50,305
one of course you have to um

588
00:18:50,845 --> 00:18:54,085
but being pregnant in this tight space

589
00:18:54,085 --> 00:18:56,845
with a bunch of little germs and

590
00:18:56,845 --> 00:18:59,065
then it was dan thanks for your

591
00:18:59,245 --> 00:19:00,805
children yeah looks like i'm

592
00:19:00,835 --> 00:19:02,201
just gonna move over here yeah because

593
00:19:02,242 --> 00:19:03,265
there are points where everyone was kinda

594
00:19:03,265 --> 00:19:04,345
corralled into one room and it was

595
00:19:04,345 --> 00:19:05,275
like you could just go to a

596
00:19:05,275 --> 00:19:06,835
different room and be alone so it's

597
00:19:06,835 --> 00:19:07,675
like that's great

598
00:19:08,305 --> 00:19:09,649
so in any case he was wrong

599
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:11,725
was that it sounds when you say

600
00:19:11,755 --> 00:19:14,095
everyone was corralled into this little room

601
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:16,765
he's younger very grim no it was

602
00:19:16,825 --> 00:19:18,025
it was loud it was like they

603
00:19:18,025 --> 00:19:20,095
were blasting music and doing like crazy

604
00:19:20,155 --> 00:19:21,715
it'd be better crazy to on test

605
00:19:21,763 --> 00:19:23,995
if you are five perfect yeah it

606
00:19:23,995 --> 00:19:26,095
was overwhelming for like they were stacking

607
00:19:26,095 --> 00:19:28,187
like you know all these foam things

608
00:19:28,195 --> 00:19:28,375
and

609
00:19:28,435 --> 00:19:30,415
into statues and stuff liking them knocking

610
00:19:30,445 --> 00:19:31,765
mostly it was work yeah it was

611
00:19:31,765 --> 00:19:33,295
just a ton of stressful to me

612
00:19:33,445 --> 00:19:34,525
so i'll let you know when construction

613
00:19:34,525 --> 00:19:36,535
job i definitely like i was like

614
00:19:36,535 --> 00:19:38,365
i see that monday through friday yeah

615
00:19:38,515 --> 00:19:39,595
i need to i was like you

616
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:42,535
pushed i was younger i worked for

617
00:19:42,535 --> 00:19:45,325
sure what like when i was starting

618
00:19:45,325 --> 00:19:46,495
out right like i would be like

619
00:19:46,495 --> 00:19:47,635
this would be my this is a

620
00:19:47,635 --> 00:19:48,595
pre baby sitting here

621
00:19:48,865 --> 00:19:49,824
it would be pardoned by the way

622
00:19:49,915 --> 00:19:51,715
to be part of this babysitting and

623
00:19:51,715 --> 00:19:52,255
then movie stuff

624
00:19:53,185 --> 00:19:55,495
so inaccurate but it wasn't that accurate

625
00:19:56,335 --> 00:19:58,225
i also think commercials

626
00:20:00,055 --> 00:20:01,495
wouldn't still do them huh yeah i

627
00:20:01,496 --> 00:20:03,025
still do from time to time when

628
00:20:03,025 --> 00:20:04,615
they pay well sure okay

629
00:20:06,595 --> 00:20:10,015
but the the ah the activity of

630
00:20:10,315 --> 00:20:12,115
leading the kids through this would've been

631
00:20:12,115 --> 00:20:13,615
a side job i went ahead first

632
00:20:13,615 --> 00:20:14,545
right yeah where i would a bit

633
00:20:14,545 --> 00:20:16,285
because it was it seemed pretty fun

634
00:20:16,285 --> 00:20:17,875
and easy for as far if you're

635
00:20:17,875 --> 00:20:19,825
a performer and it's like i bet

636
00:20:19,825 --> 00:20:21,325
it paid pretty decent but at the

637
00:20:21,325 --> 00:20:22,075
end of it at the end of

638
00:20:22,075 --> 00:20:23,005
it we go into a room and

639
00:20:23,005 --> 00:20:25,195
there's bluey and bingo i think and

640
00:20:25,195 --> 00:20:25,795
yes we

641
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:29,080
yeah sure wasn't that it was another

642
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,520
big lawyer recognized

643
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:33,640
there was a brown one but we

644
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,740
also can picture with them and i

645
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:37,660
was highly excited at that point i

646
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:39,250
think she was but she was also

647
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:41,980
really confused because they're big they're they're

648
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:43,870
bigger than they should be and they're

649
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:45,280
human size she was looking at them

650
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,570
kind of like huh but then she

651
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:47,980
was excited but in the picture she's

652
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,750
not smiling yes in the picture my

653
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:51,490
child is also not smiling yeah

654
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:53,350
but then then cut to two weeks

655
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:55,120
later she went to a child's birthday

656
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,100
party the other day yesterday where there

657
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:59,350
was a giant elmo and she's only

658
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:01,300
been watching sesame street for one calendar

659
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:04,330
week yeah she blew her mind and

660
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:05,890
she ran up in the hotel mo

661
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:07,570
unlike what she did with blue she

662
00:21:07,570 --> 00:21:08,980
was a little reticent about louis she

663
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:10,540
just hopped down would not let him

664
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:11,800
go so cute yeah

665
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:14,740
very cute um so in any case

666
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:16,180
that teases us up for this story

667
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:17,350
but we have to take a break

668
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:20,350
wow i just really quickly yeah do

669
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:23,440
you think that she was more responsive

670
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:27,280
to elmo because he seems less powerful

671
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,830
than bluey yeah i think i think

672
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,390
power dynamics were definitely a play

673
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,450
more in control of herself right right

674
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:36,220
yeah we the almost seems like a

675
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:38,230
child the bluey that you meet

676
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:44,140
is hard yes shining marcia to the

677
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:46,630
touch where i think elma not like

678
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:49,780
plushie it so it's like a foam

679
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:52,690
kind of yeah hard so big round

680
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:55,120
maybe almost fashioned out of cardboard or

681
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,460
something it was it was and then

682
00:21:57,490 --> 00:21:59,620

two weeks prior she and her best

1041
00:34:45,275 --> 00:34:47,405

1235
00:41:21,710 --> 00:41:22,910
ok so two of us are network

1236
00:41:22,910 --> 00:41:26,360
executives playing playing network executives we're not

1237
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:28,760
actually network don't send us your ideas

1238
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:30,560
will show just got fired pretending we

1239
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:34,730
have twisted um and then a person

1240
00:41:34,730 --> 00:41:36,020
comes in or one of us could

1241
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:37,370
be a network executive and it's a

1242
00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:39,020
team which which do you rather play

1243
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:40,040
i think two of us are

1244
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,650
network executives and then there's usually we

1245
00:41:42,650 --> 00:41:44,180
do and then the third person comes

1246
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:46,970
in we tell them the title of

1247
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:50,600
an existing show we've used i think

1248
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:52,790
family matters we've talked about family matters

1249
00:41:52,850 --> 00:41:55,670
we have yeah then the the person

1250
00:41:55,670 --> 00:41:57,050
who you're welcome to rewind and listen

1251
00:41:57,050 --> 00:41:58,760
for yourself we did talk about the

1252
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:00,200
person pitching the show has to

1253
00:42:00,230 --> 00:42:04,070
switch the words in that show's title

1254
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:06,410
usually they'll do the opposite so family

1255
00:42:06,410 --> 00:42:09,980
would be like enemies enemy and matters

1256
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:12,680
would be different i think the opposite

1257
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:14,360
of family his friends and you guys

1258
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:14,578
said

1259
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:19,670
but say it's say it's ah it's

1260
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:21,830
their choice to say it's enemies indifference

1261
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:24,650
and they have to pitch a sitcom

1262
00:42:24,650 --> 00:42:27,110
or a television show to the ah

1263
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:29,510
to network executives with that title and

1264
00:42:29,510 --> 00:42:31,040
then at the end they have to

1265
00:42:31,070 --> 00:42:32,810
sing the theme song for that show

1266
00:42:33,290 --> 00:42:36,200

the extended

1470
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:38,390
version that we'd find on spotify but

1471
00:49:38,390 --> 00:49:40,234
no that's the short short version yeah

1472
00:49:40,234 --> 00:49:42,500
yeah just really ninety minutes deb the

1473
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:45,110
solo song is a full fifteen minutes

1474
00:49:45,110 --> 00:49:47,120
long really yeah so it's longer than

1475
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:48,860
stairway to heaven oh yeah and is

1476
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:50,390
there anything on the screen during that

1477
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:53,900
there is a a picture of an

1478
00:49:53,930 --> 00:49:56,250
apple and then picture

1479
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:58,280
one apple one picture of one apple

1480
00:49:58,310 --> 00:50:02,300
okay then that apple magically splits into

1481
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:03,560
and then you see the two seeds

1482
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:05,420
in there then you zoom in on

1483
00:50:05,420 --> 00:50:07,280
the seeds and they say too close

1484
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:09,110
to close and then the camera zooms

1485
00:50:09,110 --> 00:50:11,390
back out so smart apple closes again

1486
00:50:11,780 --> 00:50:13,400
then you hear the home screen voice

1487
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:14,930
say i'm gonna give her another try

1488
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:16,490
and you have to really listen

1489
00:50:16,550 --> 00:50:17,900
close because the theme song is playing

1490
00:50:17,900 --> 00:50:19,520
the whole time yeah so the cameras

1491
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:21,410
starts zooming in again you have to

1492
00:50:21,410 --> 00:50:23,960
listen close well because it's if you

1493
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:25,280
wanna hear that yeah i guess you

1494
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:26,360
could turn the subtitle how do you

1495
00:50:26,390 --> 00:50:27,230
know you want to hear if you

1496
00:50:27,230 --> 00:50:28,520
know you can't turn the subtitles on

1497
00:50:28,550 --> 00:50:29,660
how do you show will not have

1498
00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:31,280
some suit doesn't have sometime oh have

1499
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:32,390
a serious question how do you know

1500
00:50:32,390 --> 00:50:33,260
you want to hear it if you

1501
00:50:33,260 --> 00:50:35,060
don't know that it's happening know you

1502
00:50:35,060 --> 00:50:36,650
can hear something but you

1503
00:50:36,710 --> 00:50:38,180
can't decipher what it is unless you're

1504
00:50:38,180 --> 00:50:40,520
listening closely because the theme song is

1505
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:41,840
loud i think you should have a

1506
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:43,220
disclaimer that says if you want to

1507
00:50:43,220 --> 00:50:45,470
hear what the sort of subtle things

1508
00:50:45,470 --> 00:50:46,520
are eating to turn it up or

1509
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:48,290
pay attention should it should that come

1510
00:50:48,290 --> 00:50:49,880
before the theme song i think it

1511
00:50:49,888 --> 00:50:51,380
just be said in the middle but

1512
00:50:51,380 --> 00:50:55,280
loud okay so how about if we

1513
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:56,780
added something in i

1514
00:50:57,500 --> 00:50:58,548
and and how about if we added

1515
00:50:58,548 --> 00:51:00,290
