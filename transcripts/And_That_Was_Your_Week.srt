i feel like i was the same

296
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,300
why would a leading question were you

297
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:23,880
small and raised or are you just

298
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:25,920
getting to a story about how your

299
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,870
smoke i was told i'm just wondering

300
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:29,250
because i know a lot of men

301
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:29,910
were very smb

302
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:30,930
all in high school and then they

303
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:33,000
got taught like later i was always

304
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,740
average i was always advertised i never

305
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:38,370
thought about my height until probably very

306
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:41,550
recently that i feel like i seem

307
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:43,830
when i see pictures with people that

308
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:45,390
i seem so much shorter than people

309
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,130
just with you know what it is

310
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:48,270
you don't i think it is about

311
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:50,070
anything like that with at least

312
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:52,440
east our situation is that we have

313
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:55,410
photographs taken all the time you have

314
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:56,910
to look at them yeah yeah and

315
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:58,260
like it makes you or like if

316
00:10:58,260 --> 00:10:59,520
you're in a movie or doing something

317
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,140
that makes you think about yourself in

318
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:02,550
a way you never would have where

319
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:03,600
like i know i would never think

320
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,980
about how i look that much absent

321
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:06,330
usually it's just that piece of glass

322
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:08,460
in my bathroom yeah that old piece

323
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,080
of glass little

324
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:12,750
isa glass in the bathroom the very

325
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:15,300

326
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,910
all glass to see his reflection he's

327
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:18,930
a witch from a cartoon

328
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:22,590
but everything that's like changed how you

329
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:23,850
you wouldn't have thought about your height

330
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:26,220

388
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:32,610
whenever i rarely cast opposite a shorter

389
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:33,180

an apple box if you're already taller

396
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,560

398
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:50,850
coming with apple the other person is

399
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:52,680
in the foreground and then your background

400
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:53,430
on an apple all right

401
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:55,470

interviewed women for like many years about

938
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,090
their sex lives and then compiled this

939
00:32:07,090 --> 00:32:10,570
book that is basically a narrative exploration

940
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:14,380
of these three different women's experiences and

941
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:16,060
it's all just about their sex lives

942
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:17,200
over the year yeah like i mean

943
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,330
it filters into their relationships and stuff

944
00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:19,630
but it's

945
00:32:19,690 --> 00:32:22,150
sure it's about like why just their

946
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:23,920
experiences that and how that shapes people

947
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:24,968
were they mad when they found out

948
00:32:24,968 --> 00:32:26,890
it was a book like it's all

949
00:32:26,890 --> 00:32:28,450
it's all in my best girlfriend all

950
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:31,030
the details have been um changed to

951
00:32:31,030 --> 00:32:32,710
make it so like penises have been

952
00:32:32,710 --> 00:32:35,590
turned into vaginas yeah that's right and

953
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:37,649
in one one whole storyline is about

954
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:39,295
a sixteen year old girl who has

955
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:39,850
a relationship

956
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:43,150
with her teacher and it's so interesting

957
00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:44,680
really i'm so one of the women

958
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:46,000
one of the three women had a

959
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,400
relationship with her teacher when yes and

960
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,020
i'm not really spoiling anything to say

961
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:52,570
that she like goes to court like

962
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:54,820
years later oh wow so it comes

963
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:56,410
up very early in her story but

964
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:58,300
um then they play back like whatever

965
00:32:58,420 --> 00:33:00,010
it happened and it's like it's cr

966
00:33:00,010 --> 00:33:02,830
crazy because it's so interesting as i

967
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:04,840
feel like okay so i'm thirty three

968
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:06,250
now but when i was sixteen to

969
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:08,530
priest it would have been so that's

970
00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:11,080
like your fantasy is that that person

971
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:12,700
would want to be with you right

972
00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:14,740
like your teacher or whatever like i

973
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:16,900
think he actually likes me and like

974
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:18,250
you could you could leave a whole

975
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:19,840
fantasy around that but then when you

976
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:20,170
read it

977
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:22,360
as an older person it's like disgusting

978
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:24,160
like this man has a wife and

979
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,570
kids and he has this young girl

980
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:27,220
in his house when she's not there

981
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:29,260
and like it's like so gross i

982
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:30,850

bowie that's spanking pen it's exactly it's

989
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:45,100
exactly that that when you look at

990
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:46,330
it as a group you know what

991
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:48,700

994
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:56,080
to cool off in court

995
00:33:57,790 --> 00:33:59,560
years later she'll realize how fucked up

996
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,210
i was talking with somebody twenty at

997
00:34:01,210 --> 00:34:03,040
this point maybe another twenty she'll finally

998
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,780
figure it out i was listening to

999
00:34:04,810 --> 00:34:07,060
um twenty years yeah i was just

1000
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:08,470
listening to the babies online

1001
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:11,470

really more able to sushi and a

1004
00:34:14,650 --> 00:34:16,480
man alone and they talk about ah

1005
00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:19,060
moral dilemmas and it's a miserable it's

1006
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:21,010
one of my favorite shows but they've

1007
00:34:21,010 --> 00:34:22,178
had on they've had a couple of

1008
00:34:22,178 --> 00:34:24,460
people on because they they they have

1009
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:26,380
a large idea that they talk about

1010
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:27,940
but they always asked their guests do

1011
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:29,230
you have a like a little idea

1012
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:29,770
that you'd like to

1013
00:34:29,770 --> 00:34:31,060
discuss little moral dilemma you'd like to

1014
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:33,040
discuss and a couple of times we've

1015
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,955
had people that have said like yeah

1016
00:34:34,955 --> 00:34:37,690
i'm thinking about having an affair

1017
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,950
on my latest yeah guest would say

1018
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:44,650
yes yes yes yes are these amazing

1019
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:47,470
open-hearted soul and i'd love to hear

1020
00:34:47,470 --> 00:34:49,420
all about that and their phone number

1021
00:34:50,170 --> 00:34:52,480
it's it's astonishing to me what's so

1022
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,790
weird about it is how you say

1023
00:34:54,850 --> 00:34:57,550
that i think that human beings are

1024
00:34:57,550 --> 00:34:58,960
human beings you know

1025
00:34:59,050 --> 00:35:00,370
everyone's human if you get caught up

1026
00:35:00,370 --> 00:35:02,290
in something i understand you make mistakes

1027
00:35:02,290 --> 00:35:04,030
accidents happen brought up but if you're

1028
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:05,530
at the point where saying like i'm

1029
00:35:05,530 --> 00:35:07,570
thinking about doing this you're yeah it's

1030
00:35:07,570 --> 00:35:09,610
like it's too chill yeah what one

1031
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:12,730
of the one of the rationalization rationalizations

1032
00:35:12,730 --> 00:35:15,310
was you know life is short you

1033
00:35:15,310 --> 00:35:16,750
only go around once so if you're

1034
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:18,070
feeling this thing you should act on

1035
00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:19,210
or whatever like that's fine

1036
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:22,240
fucking terrible idea for society and also

1037
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,560
like i don't know how you could

1038
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:26,230
possibly say publicly i'm thinking about having

1039
00:35:26,230 --> 00:35:27,700
an affair yeah you're not doing it

1040
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:30,550
yet your significant other will know yeah

1041
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:31,990
because someone would tell them you said

1042
00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:33,310
that on the podcast you don't listen

1043
00:35:33,310 --> 00:35:34,720
to it what are you doing yeah

1044
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:35,830
i mean i gotta also if you

1045
00:35:35,830 --> 00:35:37,870
feel that way about like if i'm

1046
00:35:37,870 --> 00:35:39,370
feeling away than i should act on

1047
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:40,390
on it then you should never get

1048
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:42,850
married you know because your whole thing

1049
00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:43,990
is do whatever you want at all

1050
00:35:43,990 --> 00:35:45,610
times yeah yeah never get married because

1051
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:47,350
marriages and you ok here's my view

1052
00:35:47,350 --> 00:35:49,120
on marriage are you ready oh god

1053
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:50,950
a lot of people are like see

1054
00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:52,540
how i let him do it a

1055
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:53,526
lot of a lot of people you're

1056
00:35:53,526 --> 00:35:54,880
putting us in these tiny chairs but

1057
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:58,180
okay pull down your pants no thank

1058
00:35:58,180 --> 00:35:59,530
you i thought you were

1059
00:35:59,530 --> 00:36:00,730
gonna make us sit here right where

1060
00:36:00,850 --> 00:36:03,370
your pupils um getting making it

1061
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:06,670
so i've you know how people go

1062
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:10,630
like oh well um i wasn't being

1063
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:12,310
given what i needed anymore i guess

1064
00:36:12,310 --> 00:36:13,690
there there could be some validity to

1065
00:36:13,690 --> 00:36:14,950
that but i kind of feel like

1066
00:36:14,950 --> 00:36:16,510
marriage is more about it's such like

1067
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:18,490
a crazy but if you get oh

1068
00:36:18,490 --> 00:36:21,190
you're if you're planning something well the

1069
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:22,720
the most recent person everyone's the most

1070
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,730
recent person was not in a

1071
00:36:24,730 --> 00:36:27,790
relationship so i guess they felt removed

1072
00:36:27,790 --> 00:36:29,020
from it like hey if this guy

1073
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:31,300
wants to cheat then oh i can

1074
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:33,190
do oh okay i understand saying that

1075
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:35,260
more because it's like a little bit

1076
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:37,152
low because i'm not your relationship that

1077
00:36:37,152 --> 00:36:38,470
it would be damaged by it it

1078
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:39,400
would be someone else's so you can

1079
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,080
say this is my dilemma and it's

1080
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:42,970
not ruining my boyfriend's life by me

1081
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,500
telling you this podcast may yeah i

1082
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:44,890
mean it's not

1083
00:36:44,890 --> 00:36:46,120
not good but i'm saying yeah i

1084
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:48,550
understand that more than a husband saying

1085
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:50,590
yeah a little bit more yeah but

1086
00:36:50,650 --> 00:36:52,720
it it is also if you are

1087
00:36:54,229 --> 00:36:56,110
the person wasn't freezing so much like

1088
00:36:56,110 --> 00:36:58,840
it was a dilemma it's like will

1089
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,160
i do this or won't i you

1090
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,390
know what i mean which i don't

1091
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:02,710
yeah i just feel like if you're

1092
00:37:02,710 --> 00:37:03,550
at that point

1093
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:06,640
you can avoid it yeah you of

1094
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:07,900
course you can and i feel like

1095
00:37:07,930 --> 00:37:09,310
even if even if the other i

1096
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:11,230
don't know there even if you're not

1097
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:12,700
in a relationship you still have to

1098
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:16,270
consider this other person because because anything

1099
00:37:16,270 --> 00:37:17,920
you're hearing about that person you're getting

1100
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:20,050
from this guy you know what i

1101
00:37:20,050 --> 00:37:22,435
mean yeah i'm so unhappy and this

1102
00:37:22,526 --> 00:37:24,370
and it's like i guess i'll take

1103
00:37:24,370 --> 00:37:24,670
your word

1104
00:37:24,730 --> 00:37:25,870
for it so let's have sex with

1105
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:27,820
each other but okay keep it

1106
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,730
keep going well i just think it's

1107
00:37:30,730 --> 00:37:34,630
like such a responsibility when like a

1108
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:36,880
person decides to marry you you know

1109
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:37,780
like a lot of people look at

1110
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:39,310
it very selfishly of like oh am

1111
00:37:39,310 --> 00:37:40,204
i getting what i want out of

1112
00:37:40,204 --> 00:37:41,560
the marriage am i getting but it's

1113
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:43,930
such like an incredible responsibility to know

1114
00:37:43,930 --> 00:37:48,010
that like that person's whole like reputation

1115
00:37:48,010 --> 00:37:48,700
and

1116
00:37:49,030 --> 00:37:52,510
their their happiness is like they've chosen

1117
00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:54,640
you to tie themselves up into that

1118
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:55,570
you know what it means that it's

1119
00:37:55,570 --> 00:37:58,600
just such a like it just seems

1120
00:37:58,990 --> 00:38:00,400
you know because like when it comes

1121
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,260
out oh she was being cheated on

1122
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:03,550
or he was being cheated on it's

1123
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:06,190
just like such a disruption of your

1124
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:07,780
life that they don't deserve i think

1125
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:08,950
that is true but i think if

1126
00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:09,130
you

1127
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:11,110
are unhappy you should not be married

1128
00:38:11,110 --> 00:38:12,250
just no no no i'm not saying

1129
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:13,872
that i'm just saying yeah cheating someone

1130
00:38:13,872 --> 00:38:15,130
for like lawyers are like you know

1131
00:38:15,130 --> 00:38:16,300
you're a lot of people hold a

1132
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:17,890
lot of people see look at their

1133
00:38:17,890 --> 00:38:20,620
happiness is like it's marriages and equation

1134
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:22,420
to them of like how happy is

1135
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:24,070
the other person making me instead of

1136
00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:25,450
like and what am i bring how

1137
00:38:25,450 --> 00:38:27,040
happy am i making the other person

1138
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:29,140
but also how happy am i in

1139
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:29,290
j

1140
00:38:29,290 --> 00:38:30,640
general it's like look at your life

1141
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,740
it's not like i owe my ass

1142
00:38:32,770 --> 00:38:35,110
i think it's i think it's unbelievably

1143
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:36,970
selfish to say well i have no

1144
00:38:36,970 --> 00:38:38,290
choice but to have this affair this

1145
00:38:38,290 --> 00:38:39,483
is what i have to do yeah

1146
00:38:39,610 --> 00:38:41,110
in order to be happy i mean

1147
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:42,400
there's a story like that in the

1148
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,660
book as well i highly recommend this

1149
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:46,120

not really

1152
00:38:49,450 --> 00:38:50,860
yeah that's what i figured i think

1153
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:53,230
i think you should divorce if you're

1154
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:54,640
going to have sex with someone else

1155
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:57,340
divorce your spouse and then get back

1156
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:58,750
together with them the next day

1157
00:38:59,830 --> 00:39:01,930
oh yeah yea that makes sense to

1158
00:39:01,930 --> 00:39:04,030

1283
00:43:15,905 --> 00:43:17,555
they should do that instead of roasting

1284
00:43:17,555 --> 00:43:20,555
people that should have character like birthday

1285
00:43:20,555 --> 00:43:22,925
celebrations and you can like wait instead

1286
00:43:22,925 --> 00:43:24,575
of roasts we should have better things

1287
00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:27,035
to do the celebrations of characters yeah

1288
00:43:27,095 --> 00:43:28,535
and someone says on stage as the

1289
00:43:28,535 --> 00:43:29,945
character that everyone does that kind of

1290
00:43:29,945 --> 00:43:31,565
thing it's like the opposite of historical

1291
00:43:31,565 --> 00:43:33,065
roasts were that that you take

1292
00:43:33,125 --> 00:43:35,705
famous characters celebrate or i feel like

1293
00:43:35,705 --> 00:43:38,525
roasts are are so i mean obviously

1294
00:43:38,525 --> 00:43:41,255
so mean yeah and i i have

1295
00:43:41,255 --> 00:43:42,845
a hard time well you know what

1296
00:43:42,935 --> 00:43:44,735
would be better as funerals are so

1297
00:43:44,735 --> 00:43:46,625
touching why don't we have like pre

1298
00:43:46,625 --> 00:43:48,695
funerals exactly where you want to show

1299
00:43:48,695 --> 00:43:51,675
you a funeral yeah tour yes please

1300
00:43:51,695 --> 00:43:52,175
oh so

1301
00:43:53,555 --> 00:43:55,385
so i would do i know where

1302
00:43:55,385 --> 00:43:57,185
we could explore so so it's what

1303
00:43:57,185 --> 00:43:59,285
i do over roasted peanut i had

1304
00:43:59,285 --> 00:44:00,665
a roast one time before i moved

1305
00:44:00,665 --> 00:44:02,735
to new york to think it was

1306
00:44:02,735 --> 00:44:04,499
a lot of fun jimmy pardo had

1307
00:44:04,685 --> 00:44:05,885
for his bachelor party and it was

1308
00:44:05,885 --> 00:44:07,895
fun to that makes sense i think

1309
00:44:07,895 --> 00:44:09,785
it is fun i think um i

1310
00:44:09,785 --> 00:44:11,525
would have a hard time writing things

1311
00:44:11,525 --> 00:44:13,415
for i think walking that line of

1312
00:44:14,285 --> 00:44:16,655
of being mean but everyone's somebody worried

1313
00:44:16,655 --> 00:44:18,065
about it some people were worried yeah

1314
00:44:18,125 --> 00:44:19,745
and jimmy was with somebody who was

1315
00:44:19,745 --> 00:44:21,875
worried about it right and by it

1316
00:44:21,875 --> 00:44:23,135
but it turned out everyone was really

1317
00:44:23,135 --> 00:44:24,635
fun and it was action it up

1318
00:44:24,635 --> 00:44:26,795
yeah yes even and there it was

1319
00:44:26,795 --> 00:44:29,165
even stuff that um although i got

1320
00:44:29,225 --> 00:44:32,705
various like you cry there was unexpected

1321
00:44:32,705 --> 00:44:33,335
stuff

1322
00:44:33,605 --> 00:44:35,915
like unexpected areas of ribbing that i

1323
00:44:35,915 --> 00:44:37,955

1423
00:47:38,825 --> 00:47:40,745
this medicine cam rallies is medicine no

1424
00:47:40,745 --> 00:47:43,115
but isn't that usually for people like

1425
00:47:43,115 --> 00:47:44,465
look at oh my god they're on

1426
00:47:44,675 --> 00:47:46,925
antidepressant i don't know because it's never

1427
00:47:46,925 --> 00:47:48,635
been a thing that i've done i

1428
00:47:48,635 --> 00:47:50,435
assume that's what it is it drove

1429
00:47:50,495 --> 00:47:52,565
yeah right enough but i know people

1430
00:47:52,565 --> 00:47:54,125
that do it like you said

1431
00:47:54,395 --> 00:47:56,045
to snoop like for sure and so

1432
00:47:56,045 --> 00:47:57,635
now it's more like it might i

1433
00:47:57,635 --> 00:47:59,285
might think oh i could snoop right

1434
00:47:59,285 --> 00:48:00,695
now when you were babysitting would you

1435
00:48:00,695 --> 00:48:02,225
snoop throughout the entire house i would

1436
00:48:02,225 --> 00:48:03,485
stoop a little but i was always

1437
00:48:03,485 --> 00:48:05,045
afraid that they would know somehow or

1438
00:48:05,045 --> 00:48:05,945
that they had set up a trap

1439
00:48:05,945 --> 00:48:07,985
for me that i would not do

1440
00:48:07,985 --> 00:48:09,965
it like a hair across the drawer

1441
00:48:09,965 --> 00:48:11,615
yeah whatever like a bear trap yeah

1442
00:48:12,125 --> 00:48:14,375
sure the tiger bar like i

1443
00:48:14,375 --> 00:48:15,545
i would disturb something it would be

1444
00:48:15,545 --> 00:48:17,011
obvious that i had opened it right

1445
00:48:17,067 --> 00:48:18,575
i'm sure no one would care or

1446
00:48:18,575 --> 00:48:20,435
know and whatever i think i might

1447
00:48:20,435 --> 00:48:23,255
have done that when i was little

1448
00:48:23,285 --> 00:48:24,665
like when i was like a kid

1449
00:48:24,665 --> 00:48:26,525
going over somebody else's house yeah i've

1450
00:48:26,735 --> 00:48:27,905

1451
00:48:27,905 --> 00:48:29,945

they showed three different women with different

1515
00:50:45,875 --> 00:50:48,065
colored hair on their heads and how

1516
00:50:48,065 --> 00:50:48,215
they're

1517
00:50:48,875 --> 00:50:52,025
and would correspond yeah the carpet would

1518
00:50:52,205 --> 00:50:54,395
match the drapes so it was truly

1519
00:50:54,395 --> 00:50:56,075
a chapter about carpi which is a

1520
00:50:56,075 --> 00:50:58,265
little picture within a page about pubic

1521
00:50:58,265 --> 00:50:59,735
hair oh because she's good like i

1522
00:50:59,735 --> 00:51:02,855

00:52:10,385 --> 00:52:13,595
from the class were tits they showed

1556
00:52:13,595 --> 00:52:15,005

1558
00:52:17,675 --> 00:52:20,105

1559
00:52:20,135 --> 00:52:21,305
about when you say they showed a

1560
00:52:21,305 --> 00:52:22,925

1561
00:52:22,955 --> 00:52:26,285
it was not like an educational film

no it was well it wasn't like

1563
00:52:28,985 --> 00:52:29,885

1564
00:52:29,885 --> 00:52:32,615
halfway between things where it wasn't educational

1565
00:52:32,615 --> 00:52:34,235
but it wasn't like pure just like

1566
00:52:34,775 --> 00:52:36,845

1579
00:53:00,155 --> 00:53:00,875

1580
00:53:02,212 --> 00:53:03,425

1744
00:58:47,765 --> 00:58:48,785
oh is that what you're gonna do

i'm not sure i'm interested know with

1746
00:58:50,435 --> 00:58:51,410
words oh

1747
00:58:53,015 --> 00:58:54,635
like the other day when you went

1748
00:58:54,665 --> 00:58:56,435
to that meter men you had to

1749
00:58:56,435 --> 00:58:58,985
physically with your own hands i know

1750
00:58:58,985 --> 00:59:00,455
move that scooter out of the way

1751
00:59:00,905 --> 00:59:02,765
i'm just i'm retching thinking about it

1752
00:59:02,855 --> 00:59:06,515
what if you were able to command

1753
00:59:06,575 --> 00:59:08,255
that scooter to get out of the

1754
00:59:08,255 --> 00:59:09,515
way and it did it by itself

1755
00:59:09,515 --> 00:59:12,515
bed knobs and broomsticks whoa what i'm

1756
00:59:12,516 --> 00:59:12,875
propose

1757
00:59:12,875 --> 00:59:16,625
oozing is an invention that hacks the

1758
00:59:16,655 --> 00:59:21,875
computer system in the ah scooter by

1759
00:59:21,875 --> 00:59:25,205
means of a high-pitched squeaks remember that

1760
00:59:25,205 --> 00:59:27,095
thing from brookstone oh of course i

1761
00:59:27,095 --> 00:59:29,643
do remote controls my favorite thing i

1762
00:59:29,889 --> 00:59:31,385
squeeze to turn off the tv yes

1763
00:59:31,385 --> 00:59:33,035
why i'm adapting that principle

1764
00:59:33,035 --> 00:59:36,005
me to to these scooters now here's

1765
00:59:36,005 --> 00:59:37,835
the thing it's not always going to

1766
00:59:37,835 --> 00:59:39,695
get at the first time okay so

1767
00:59:39,695 --> 00:59:41,345
you gotta keep squeezing it and the

1768
00:59:41,705 --> 00:59:43,085
tweets are going to get higher or

1769
00:59:43,085 --> 00:59:44,975
lower depending on how much pressure you

1770
00:59:44,975 --> 00:59:46,955
give cheryl squeaker but i like squeezing

1771
00:59:46,955 --> 00:59:49,535
things but eventually if you like squeezing

1772
00:59:49,535 --> 00:59:50,765
things this is the image for you

1773
00:59:50,795 --> 00:59:52,205
wow okay well i haven't even had

1774
00:59:52,205 --> 00:59:53,075
a chance to pitch my

1775
00:59:53,195 --> 00:59:56,675
eventually you will you will stumble upon

1776
00:59:56,675 --> 00:59:59,375
the frequency of the scooter and cause

1777
00:59:59,376 --> 01:00:00,875
it to go zipping down the street

1778
01:00:00,875 --> 01:00:02,255
it just goes swimming down to the

1779
01:00:02,255 --> 01:00:04,055
end is it my responsibility once it

1780
01:00:04,145 --> 01:00:06,005
goes or is it just the scooter

1781
01:00:06,035 --> 01:00:07,205
why would it be if it hits

1782
01:00:07,205 --> 01:00:08,855
so i wouldn't be okay you didn't

1783
01:00:08,855 --> 01:00:11,525
rent that scooter right yeah there's fingerprints

1784
01:00:11,525 --> 01:00:12,995
are nowhere on it no you're not

1785
01:00:12,995 --> 01:00:13,355
even see

1786
01:00:13,385 --> 01:00:15,005
and you're not even you know touching

1787
01:00:15,005 --> 01:00:17,375
it wow and this venture is called

1788
01:00:17,375 --> 01:00:21,095
the scoot ah oh like mad at

1789
01:00:21,095 --> 01:00:22,895
it yes i love it but also

1790
01:00:22,895 --> 01:00:25,385
an expression of power ah i'm wrong

1791
01:00:25,445 --> 01:00:27,275
baffle you are the son of a

1792
01:00:27,275 --> 01:00:29,855
famous inventor as li yu u-m lout

1793
01:00:30,005 --> 01:00:31,745
t o r ooh i don't like

1794
01:00:31,745 --> 01:00:33,305
that okay well what do you have

1795
01:00:33,815 --> 01:00:35,765
honey oh my please don't talk to

1796
01:00:35,765 --> 01:00:37,325
me i will kick your nuts all

1797
01:00:37,325 --> 01:00:38,525
the way up into your neck

1798
01:00:40,505 --> 01:00:42,575
all the way down there from the

1799
01:00:42,575 --> 01:00:44,555
top of my head short journeys guys

1800
01:00:44,555 --> 01:00:48,095
very small fasting so my idea is

1801
01:00:48,095 --> 01:00:48,695
as thus

1802
01:00:51,820 --> 01:00:54,940
it is um actually ah a series

1803
01:00:54,940 --> 01:00:57,940
of gigantic big bins these bins are

1804
01:00:57,940 --> 01:00:59,800
bigger than a trash can and they

1805
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:01,780
are on every corner in the city

1806
01:01:01,810 --> 01:01:04,780
really big yes and i want everyone

1807
01:01:04,780 --> 01:01:07,030
to throw the bird scooter into the

1808
01:01:07,030 --> 01:01:09,400
trash can were set looking receptacle

1809
01:01:10,360 --> 01:01:11,830
and it's just shaped like a trash

1810
01:01:11,830 --> 01:01:13,510
can like an ape like a big

1811
01:01:13,540 --> 01:01:15,670
yoder it's shaped like a scooter so

1812
01:01:15,670 --> 01:01:17,140
it has to fit in exactly because

1813
01:01:17,140 --> 01:01:19,390
a dumpster so a bunch can fit

1814
01:01:19,390 --> 01:01:21,970
in okay and it is a way

1815
01:01:21,970 --> 01:01:23,350
to get them off the streets so

1816
01:01:23,350 --> 01:01:24,460
the second you see when you you

1817
01:01:24,460 --> 01:01:26,320
have to have hulk like strength and

1818
01:01:26,320 --> 01:01:28,180
you throw it over into the the

1819
01:01:28,210 --> 01:01:29,770
um been okay well i do have

1820
01:01:29,770 --> 01:01:30,100
hulk like

1821
01:01:30,100 --> 01:01:32,020
gg strengths so that's not a problem

1822
01:01:32,020 --> 01:01:34,000

i would like to know this before

1865
01:02:57,970 --> 01:03:00,280
i decide whose dubai where were the

1866
01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:02,590
same thursday are one

1867
01:03:04,840 --> 01:03:06,880
you're the same proud as outwork your

1868
01:03:06,910 --> 01:03:09,490
different facets of the same person stupid

1869
01:03:10,030 --> 01:03:11,590
when i was born out of parasitic

1870
01:03:11,590 --> 01:03:13,870
twin growing inside me that's her me

1871
01:03:13,870 --> 01:03:15,100
and guess what i grew up and

1872
01:03:15,100 --> 01:03:16,900
i'm actually not a parasite yeah it's

1873
01:03:16,900 --> 01:03:18,550
great now we're friends i have a

1874
01:03:18,550 --> 01:03:20,830
personality and everything but we do compete

1875
01:03:20,830 --> 01:03:23,350
with each other for inventions we we

1876
01:03:23,350 --> 01:03:23,860
just need someone

1877
01:03:23,890 --> 01:03:24,970
to be chosen because we have to

1878
01:03:24,970 --> 01:03:26,710
get to work you're going gonna get

1879
01:03:26,710 --> 01:03:27,760
to work on it right away i

1880
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:29,170
thought you guys were flat out sleepy

1881
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:30,640
think we're going to do we live

1882
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:33,010
to invent all right well um i

1883
01:03:33,010 --> 01:03:35,620
have to say that i think it's

1884
01:03:35,620 --> 01:03:38,080
impractical to shape these bins like the

1885
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:41,410
scooters themselves because even though it's bigger

1886
01:03:41,410 --> 01:03:44,020
than scooter it's not the most

1887
01:03:44,062 --> 01:03:46,816
convenient way of actually fitting things in

1888
01:03:46,816 --> 01:03:48,400
my house people know it's not a

1889
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:50,950
trash compactor that's a good point she's

1890
01:03:50,950 --> 01:03:52,930

1893
01:03:57,370 --> 01:03:59,260
oh yeah but i'm it sounded like

1894
01:03:59,260 --> 01:04:00,284
to me like you can see it

1895
01:04:00,336 --> 01:04:01,540
the whole ring i saw you had

1896
01:04:01,540 --> 01:04:03,490
more stuff i can't help because we

1897
01:04:03,490 --> 01:04:04,120

01:04:04,180 --> 01:04:06,190
relationship i her i know that he

1899
01:04:06,190 --> 01:04:07,450

1951
01:05:57,310 --> 01:05:58,930
you go first alright well i have

1952
01:05:58,930 --> 01:06:02,500
an invention called the tube meadow wow

1953
01:06:02,620 --> 01:06:04,840
and what this is is okay the

1954
01:06:04,840 --> 01:06:07,960
average human mouth is one in diameter

1955
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:10,300
three inches now one tomato

1956
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:13,450
yeah i guess i shouldn't even be

1957
01:06:13,450 --> 01:06:15,610
answered yeah she's the one who's supposed

1958
01:06:15,610 --> 01:06:17,110
to answer i help robbers and it's

1959
01:06:17,110 --> 01:06:18,729
perfectly round the size we've made the

1960
01:06:18,729 --> 01:06:22,060
exact size of a tomato well what

1961
01:06:22,060 --> 01:06:24,460
if your mouth was three tomatoes wide

1962
01:06:25,450 --> 01:06:28,060
okay go on okay i have teamed

1963
01:06:28,060 --> 01:06:30,100
up with one of beverly hills is

1964
01:06:30,280 --> 01:06:31,540
top plastic sir

1965
01:06:31,540 --> 01:06:34,930
surgeons to widen your mouth so wide

1966
01:06:34,930 --> 01:06:36,190
that we can put the two meadow

1967
01:06:36,250 --> 01:06:39,010
into your mouth to meadow to premade

1968
01:06:39,010 --> 01:06:41,350
dough it i know it's a little

1969
01:06:41,350 --> 01:06:43,480
confusing because it actually fits three tomatoes

1970
01:06:43,480 --> 01:06:44,710
so a lot of people think it's

1971
01:06:44,710 --> 01:06:47,530
too meadow but it's actually two tomato

1972
01:06:47,530 --> 01:06:49,420
and they feel any tomatoes and just

1973
01:06:49,420 --> 01:06:51,700
schiff these tomatoes right into your mouth

1974
01:06:51,700 --> 01:06:55,240
mouth as long as the plastic surgeon

1975
01:06:55,240 --> 01:06:58,390
comes ah does his business approximately six

1976
01:06:58,390 --> 01:07:00,880
months before the two mayo's installed okay

1977
01:07:00,940 --> 01:07:03,460
and he's a sixteen six month lead

1978
01:07:03,460 --> 01:07:05,410
time six months lead time it's vacuum

1979
01:07:05,410 --> 01:07:08,410
technology you'll need to be hooked up

1980
01:07:08,410 --> 01:07:10,420
to a sort of a vacuum sealed

1981
01:07:10,420 --> 01:07:11,500
kind of situation

1982
01:07:11,980 --> 01:07:14,170
and you'll need to constantly be forcing

1983
01:07:14,170 --> 01:07:16,300
tomatoes into the tube i like what

1984
01:07:16,300 --> 01:07:18,730
you're talking about okay um and you

1985
01:07:18,730 --> 01:07:21,730
mister monday doctor whatever robert mundane i'm

1986
01:07:21,730 --> 01:07:24,670
a dunker of inventing he was it

1987
01:07:24,670 --> 01:07:27,910
was an honorary doctorate was still from

1988
01:07:27,910 --> 01:07:29,890
temple university i had to wear a

1989
01:07:29,890 --> 01:07:31,660
cap and gown yeah and delivers speed

1990
01:07:31,690 --> 01:07:32,020
i guess

1991
01:07:32,050 --> 01:07:35,740
who he was awarded that honorary doctorate

1992
01:07:35,740 --> 01:07:37,090
with it was on the same day

1993
01:07:37,120 --> 01:07:38,980
the temple owl oh

1994
01:07:40,390 --> 01:07:44,650
now them tomatoes we love them but

1995
01:07:44,650 --> 01:07:47,080
there's so many when you bite i

1996
01:07:47,290 --> 01:07:49,210
was exactly right i like what he

1997
01:07:49,210 --> 01:07:51,670
says on fair now just restate her

1998
01:07:51,670 --> 01:07:53,410

you suffer at one part i need

2002
01:07:58,810 --> 01:08:00,010
i need both of you

2003
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:01,930
to shut up and i did one

2004
01:08:01,930 --> 01:08:03,040
of you to talk that's me of

2005
01:08:03,040 --> 01:08:03,550
the top one

2006
01:08:04,930 --> 01:08:07,660
imagine this use trying to solve your

2007
01:08:07,660 --> 01:08:09,190
problem of how to eat the tomatoes

2008
01:08:09,190 --> 01:08:11,530
before they go smoosh by buying smaller

2009
01:08:11,530 --> 01:08:13,660
tomatoes but you don't want that because

2010
01:08:13,660 --> 01:08:15,040
even though they're easier to eat and

2011
01:08:15,040 --> 01:08:16,870
they go faster you can't have that

2012
01:08:16,870 --> 01:08:20,980
slicing tomato experience yes exactly that's why

2013
01:08:20,980 --> 01:08:24,340
i've invented the less meadow it is

2014
01:08:24,340 --> 01:08:24,820
just the

2015
01:08:24,820 --> 01:08:27,130
the outside of the tomato so you

2016
01:08:27,130 --> 01:08:30,790
get tomato slices but you need more

2017
01:08:32,470 --> 01:08:34,090
on each sense but he said what

2018
01:08:34,300 --> 01:08:36,130
so you're going through channels like what

2019
01:08:36,160 --> 01:08:38,620
or salad so you don't do the

2020
01:08:38,620 --> 01:08:41,410
tomatoes like wildfire love the nothing's wasted

2021
01:08:41,530 --> 01:08:43,030
and you don't have any leftover and

2022
01:08:43,030 --> 01:08:44,290
how are you going to grow these

2023
01:08:44,290 --> 01:08:47,860

from the outside okay but from the

2076
01:10:44,140 --> 01:10:46,720
inside i can't see out on the

01:11:13,040 --> 01:11:14,660
for a living okay i don't

2090
01:11:14,660 --> 01:11:17,030

2091
01:11:17,030 --> 01:11:19,250
cheating on their wives okay mad because

2092
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:21,140

guess who he could've been with in

2098
01:11:29,990 --> 01:11:31,820
this town who would be so embarrassing

2099
01:11:31,820 --> 01:11:35,300
to be with the mayor her i

2100
01:11:35,300 --> 01:11:36,530
was with her and i got all

2101
01:11:36,530 --> 01:11:38,300
the pictures to prove it easy to

2102
01:11:38,300 --> 01:11:40,220
get those pictures oh that's what you

2103
01:11:40,220 --> 01:11:41,480
say you know what he didn't know

2104
01:11:41,480 --> 01:11:42,350
i was taking any of them so

2105
01:11:42,350 --> 01:11:44,540
how about that but my mundane problem

2106
01:11:45,200 --> 01:11:47,390
okay okay i've invented a solution for

2107
01:11:47,390 --> 01:11:48,590
this and the great thing is is

2108
01:11:48,590 --> 01:11:48,980
i've already

2109
01:11:48,980 --> 01:11:50,690
he invaded it so you can just

2110
01:11:50,690 --> 01:11:52,520
buy it today this is unfortunate for

2111
01:11:52,520 --> 01:11:54,950
me this is the half invisible shrub

2112
01:11:56,870 --> 01:11:59,570
that's right it's half invisible it's invisible

2113
01:12:00,170 --> 01:12:02,480
on one side so you can see

2114
01:12:02,480 --> 01:12:04,790
out into the street and it is

2115
01:12:05,060 --> 01:12:07,160
totally visible on the other side so

2116
01:12:07,160 --> 01:12:08,870
no one can see a two-way shrub

2117
01:12:08,870 --> 01:12:10,550
yeah to nature yeah it's a lot

2118
01:12:10,550 --> 01:12:12,230
like um you ever seen one of

2119
01:12:12,230 --> 01:12:15,140
those detective shows where they're interrogating someone

2120
01:12:15,170 --> 01:12:16,340
yeah this is why i said two-way

2121
01:12:17,270 --> 01:12:18,740
use a two-way yeah i thought i

2122
01:12:18,740 --> 01:12:20,150
said to no i said it you

2123
01:12:20,150 --> 01:12:21,410
said you said have them ring a

2124
01:12:21,410 --> 01:12:23,870
bell not ringing i say prove who

2125
01:12:23,870 --> 01:12:25,790
