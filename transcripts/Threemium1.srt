00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:55,050
inevitably threesome comes up as a topic

81
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:57,480
of conversation so is my question is

hi to your mom for me yes

89
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:16,710
um do you think that an andrew's

90
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:19,050
mom maybe you're just a pure listener

91
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,540
but ah are you listening just because

92
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:22,530
you know your son likes it and

93
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:24,000
you want to bond with him oh

94
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,280
that's nice oh but nobody i'm thinking

95
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,920
andrew might be younger and that his

96
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,480
mom is more in the age range

97
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:32,462
where it's oh yeah normal for her

98
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:35,010
to listen to this i think andrew's

99
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:38,850
mom is younger than andrew yeah look

100
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:41,040
my mom also likes threesome is that

101
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,870
true yeah trish are you kidding me

102
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,820
a handful of my fellow members listen

103
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:47,580
to three what a handful now any

104
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:49,200
more than a handful is too much

105
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:51,090
yeah it might be two maybe two

106
00:03:51,226 --> 00:03:54,240
two anvils maybe two people um well

107
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,860

108
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:58,950

109
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:01,110

growing up that my parents would watch

143
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:07,620
letterman and then they would call me

144
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:08,610
out of my room for the top

145
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:10,560

ten one

150
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:16,620

156
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:29,490
um i like it and so i

157
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:30,630
would watch the top ten and i

158
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:32,250
was always fun but we went as

159
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:33,990
a family we watched and continue to

160
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:35,280
watch a lot of tv together

161
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,630
or so my mom and i have

162
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:39,090
bonded a lot over ninety day fiance

163
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:41,370
but i stopped watching more recently but

164
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:42,990
it's annoying because she still wants to

165
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:44,820
talk about it yeah we also both

166
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:47,280
watched the bachelor that kind of stuff

167
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,780
we like a lot of realities okay

168
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:52,140
yeah i would i had a different

169
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:54,300
upbringing where my parents were always suspicious

170
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:55,110
of anything that i

171
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:58,230
was watching so so but i i

172
00:05:58,230 --> 00:06:01,050
will say like i think i remember

173
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:03,990
one time i was watching ah conan

174
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:06,000
i think late at night and my

175
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,420
dad got up um and came out

176
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:11,820
and i remember from where i got

177
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,020
it from his bedroom because it was

178
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:14,160
late because i mean this is like

179
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:15,600
running tv yeah this is well

180
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:17,310
i don't know if the rocket i

181
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:18,210
don't think it was because i was

182
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:19,800
listening to it or watching a pretty

183
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,840
softly but you're like an inch away

184
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,370
from the scratch now that i'm older

185
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:25,230
i realised like anything will wake you

186
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:26,370
up and you'll just yeah like be

187
