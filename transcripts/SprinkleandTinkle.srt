54
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:19,320
all one word um

55
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:21,180
forward slash

56
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:24,510
well anyway it's really good okay um

57
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:28,770
who reads it she does watts of

58
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:30,510
course she does and she does so

59
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:32,190
many voices and it makes it really

60
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:33,780
great i think it's i like when

61
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:34,950
does she do baluch

62
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:38,040
um well she she does like so

63
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,300
she does talk about a lot of

64
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:42,840
sketches and she um you know sort

65
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,210
of not doesn't digitally do impressions of

66
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:46,200
the people doing the sketches but she

67
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,610
kind of you know loosely well in

68
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:49,230
some of those moments but she in

69
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:51,330
her stories even just what where she's

70
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:52,830
quoting herself as a kid she does

71
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:55,350
voices and it really enhances and i

72
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:56,160
like when people

73
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:59,100
i like audiobooks when enhance well because

74
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,810
i listened to audiobooks every once in

75
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:03,630
awhile and it's always better when the

76
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:05,850
person doing it is like a performer

77
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:08,550
and not just a rino let me

78
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:10,950
ask you this loren lapidus when you

79
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:12,390
listen to the audiobooks because i'm not

80
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:15,033
an audiobook guy because i listened to

81
00:03:15,033 --> 00:03:16,290
i listen to a lot of podcasts

82
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,790
and i i listen to those when

83
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:19,770
i'm doing other things or driving or

84
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:22,440
whatever i my fear is if i'm

85
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,750
listening to an audio book i will

86
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,330
i will lose the thread of what

87
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:29,260
wind up the sacramento because it's not

88
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:30,900
i don't want to go there even

89
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,400
though it's our state capital and i

90
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,760
respect this keep driving and driving i

91
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:36,480
just i

92
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:38,430
mike long a map where the dragons

93
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:38,730
are

94
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,210
um so i is is it it

95
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:43,530
feel like you're driving listen to an

96
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,110
audio book um are you able to

97
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:48,300
follow along do you ever find yourself

98
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:50,700
like spacing out i've had moments where

99
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,530
i missed something with audiobooks and i'll

100
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:54,420
just rewind it but like for the

101
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:56,250
most part i like it because i

102
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:57,420
listen to a lot of podcasts too

103
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:59,970
and i will always reach stages

104
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,340
well no i do though okay okay

105
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:03,930
and well there always is a point

106
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:05,220
where i've listened to all of my

107
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:07,380
new podcasts and i'm like oh i

108
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:08,370
don't have anything listen to and i

109
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:09,630
really want something and then i'll remember

110
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:11,760
my audiobook section and then i'll put

111
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,960
that on and then and then i

112
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,340
can spend a whole day with someone

113
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:16,230
like with lorraine i was like listening

114
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:18,180
to her for like four hours one

115
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:19,320
day and it was like the it

116
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,160
felt it felt

117
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,050
i like it also feels like productive

118
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:24,930
in a way well because technically it's

119
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:25,890
a book it's a book

120
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:28,140
so you can say you read the

121
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:29,716
book you ever do that but like

122
00:04:29,716 --> 00:04:31,020
i don't i don't say that i

123
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,310
say i got the audiobook say also

124
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:34,980
that casey wilson's audio book and i

125
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:37,380
really liked hearing her read it and

126
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:39,270
i also think the when you tell

127
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:40,740
the author i got the audiobook it's

128
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:42,600
like makes that worth their time because

129
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,670
you know it's like a whole thing

130
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:46,230
they had to do exactly so you

131
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:47,250
feel sorry for these people

132
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:51,000
i wonder what relevancy i liked your

133
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,080
book i would say i like your

134
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,690
audio book because right performed it i

135
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:56,460
wonder what takes longer writing the book

136
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:57,870
or performing the audiobook

137
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:00,518
i assume most books are written in

138
00:05:00,518 --> 00:05:01,950
the amount of time takes reader hey

139
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:06,510
no no orange dying there's no oh

140
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:09,270
no for a waterway yeah so wrong

141
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:09,870
pipe

142
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,100
what is the wrong type what's the

143
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,600
like what a pipe in the wrong

144
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,920
pipe along the right the right pipe

145
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,110
is tummy pipe the wrong pipe stereotype

146
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:20,340
is yeah really put them next to

147
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:22,860
each other i know flow get me

148
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,870
my air pipe is my tummy pipe

149
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:27,210
do you think that when you swallow

150
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,860
water and it goes into your lungs

151
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,870
by accident just days there and gets

152
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:31,200

and so this is the this is

285
00:10:15,255 --> 00:10:16,966
the worst part of all reality tv

286
00:10:16,966 --> 00:10:17,865
is they all have to sleep in

00:13:22,215 --> 00:13:24,945
not getting great sleep um for some

375
00:13:24,945 --> 00:13:26,205
reason i think it was a temperature

376
00:13:26,205 --> 00:13:27,735
thing because i think it was a

377
00:13:27,735 --> 00:13:29,895
temperature thing yeah it was going too

378
00:13:29,895 --> 00:13:31,635
hot it was a little too hot

379
00:13:31,845 --> 00:13:33,195

380
00:13:33,195 --> 00:13:34,275
bed than we usually do and i

381
00:13:34,275 --> 00:13:36,585

00:13:38,775 --> 00:13:39,315
janie puts out

384
00:13:39,345 --> 00:13:40,815
a lot of heat and so the

385
00:13:40,815 --> 00:13:42,675
heat was coming up in waves to

386
00:13:42,675 --> 00:13:44,685

506
00:17:46,395 --> 00:17:46,845
really hurtful

507
00:17:48,495 --> 00:17:50,505
kidding i don't care i saw i

508
00:17:50,505 --> 00:17:52,755
saw a pilot of mine recently when

509
00:17:52,755 --> 00:17:54,225
i was you know digitizing all that

510
00:17:54,225 --> 00:17:56,115
stuff it was a pilot that was

511
00:17:56,115 --> 00:18:00,165
like a pre modern family type show

512
00:18:00,345 --> 00:18:01,875
where it was a reality show about

513
00:18:01,875 --> 00:18:04,575
a family um just one family not

514
00:18:04,575 --> 00:18:06,315
like the extended family and two of

515
00:18:06,315 --> 00:18:07,875
the writers went on to write for

516
00:18:08,145 --> 00:18:09,675
modern family the the two guys that

517
00:18:09,675 --> 00:18:10,845
created a went under right from our

518
00:18:10,845 --> 00:18:12,855
family but i was essentially the ty

519
00:18:12,855 --> 00:18:16,335
burrell role and i looking back at

520
00:18:16,335 --> 00:18:20,085
it this guy is a fucking creep

521
00:18:21,195 --> 00:18:24,255
you played yes he's like you didn't

522
00:18:24,255 --> 00:18:25,725
realize it at the time at the

523
00:18:25,725 --> 00:18:27,345
time at the time it was very

524
00:18:27,345 --> 00:18:28,275
much like these the

525
00:18:28,305 --> 00:18:30,735
sort of office antihero it was comedy

526
00:18:30,735 --> 00:18:32,175
you know kind of cringe comedy yeah

527
00:18:32,415 --> 00:18:33,465
and so he says things that are

528
00:18:33,465 --> 00:18:35,715
inappropriate or whatever but you're still supposed

529
00:18:35,715 --> 00:18:37,125
to care about the guy it was

530
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:40,095
very weird like he says vaguely racist

531
00:18:40,095 --> 00:18:43,755
things sometimes and um ah like very

532
00:18:43,755 --> 00:18:46,035
misogynistic and like he's a real creep

533
00:18:46,035 --> 00:18:48,435
with the there's this birthday party

534
00:18:48,975 --> 00:18:50,895
for there's like a barbeque and he's

535
00:18:50,895 --> 00:18:54,015
like ogling these women it's fucking it

536
00:18:54,015 --> 00:18:56,655
was so weird it was so weird

537
00:18:56,655 --> 00:18:58,305
and gross that is weird

538
00:18:59,025 --> 00:18:59,985
but at the time were like this

539
00:18:59,985 --> 00:19:02,235
guy's cool i didn't think he was

540
00:19:02,265 --> 00:19:05,325
cool necessarily but i embraced i embraced

541
00:19:05,325 --> 00:19:06,465
i want to be like this guy

542
00:19:06,555 --> 00:19:09,555
but scott you're pleased this is this

543
00:19:09,555 --> 00:19:11,565
gets out there yeah i'm finished oh

544
00:19:11,565 --> 00:19:13,305
no i'm sorry

545
00:19:15,465 --> 00:19:17,085
oh well that's okay i have no

546
00:19:17,085 --> 00:19:20,355
pilots that i ever did nah no

547
00:19:20,385 --> 00:19:22,155
what about that next pilot were you

548
00:19:22,155 --> 00:19:23,445
in that at all oh i made

549
00:19:23,445 --> 00:19:27,435
pilots it was your next ah cameo

550
00:19:27,435 --> 00:19:29,925
hitchcock god i don't remember i don't

551
00:19:29,925 --> 00:19:31,785
think so but i can't remember i

552
00:19:31,785 --> 00:19:33,975
directed a video for it but i

553
00:19:34,155 --> 00:19:34,515
i do

554
00:19:34,515 --> 00:19:35,985
i think that made the difference like

555
00:19:35,985 --> 00:19:36,913
maybe if you'd been in it it

556
00:19:36,915 --> 00:19:39,255
would have got picked up maybe yeah

557
00:19:39,315 --> 00:19:40,875

622
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,510
pranking paul at the same time oh

628
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:16,510
and then i was like that was

629
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:16,900
scott

630
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:20,860

633
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:27,790
about one hundred collective it was still

634
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:30,130
a thing yeah and so i tried

635
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:31,420

god well so then i um i

640
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:44,710
got through and and i then i

641
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:45,970
thought oh i should be calling scott

642
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:47,710
it's way funnier for that reveal instead

643
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:48,940
of hearing this clutch person so then

644
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:51,940
i called you this game but then

645
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:53,590
i called collette again to see if

646
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:55,240
it actually worked and it was so

647
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:55,690
weird because

648
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:57,580
i called when i called paul collect

649
00:22:57,610 --> 00:22:59,260
it showed my name on his phone

650
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:01,420
which i thought was like we ah

651
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:04,240
and then we found out that it

652
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,460
was sixteen dollars for a collect call

653
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:09,160
what here's what's what's also very strange

654
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:11,890
as my phone instinctively sent that called

655
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:13,570
a voicemail like i just i held

656
00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:15,910
up the phone to show lauren and

657
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:17,380
and then i it was like two

658
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:19,390
rings and then it went to smell

659
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:21,040
like somehow my phone knew this is

660
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:24,040
bullshit yeah yeah it was only weird

661
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,360
don't pick up for sixteen to wait

662
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,190
so someone got charged sixteen dollars no

663
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:28,750
it was if he had answered it

664
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:30,070
would have been like sixteen dollars for

665
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:31,870
thirty minutes or so yeah over thirty

666
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:34,420
minutes but i still think that's a

667
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:36,070
lot yeah well i mean no

668
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:38,470
one's calling anyone for thirty minutes it's

669
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:40,750
like it's a two minute call you

670
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:41,860
don't hear i'm at the corner of

671
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:43,090
this and this come pick me up

672
00:23:43,112 --> 00:23:44,620
but it's still gonna be like then

673
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:46,690
a couple of bucks is going to

674
00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:48,400
be global but we should we should

675
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:50,800
yank it out there for free if

00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:53,620

about it in life but i don't

769
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:12,790
know you know it's truly tear

770
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:14,830
terrifying like we pulled up and it

771
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:17,230
was like so creepily arizona so what

772
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:18,940
it was was it was a it

773
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:20,530

00:27:20,530 --> 00:27:22,720
shipping container made into an air bnb

it was built into a hill on

778
00:27:27,610 --> 00:27:29,800
the pressures right and so it looked

779
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:32,770
cool and then in person it was

780
00:27:32,770 --> 00:27:32,950
odd

781
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:35,050
easily the creepiest and grossest thing i've

782
00:27:35,050 --> 00:27:36,850
ever seen the guy we left like

783
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,730
instantly um still we we got there

00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:42,100
and we walked inside though we went

785
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:43,180

hopefully i know what little it looked

791
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:54,640
it looks really private the way it

792
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,520
was photographed glass doors in the they

793
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:00,250
sure didn't realize you needed it to

794
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:01,750
be glasser because it was so fucking

795
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:04,750
dark in this world thing so why

796
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:06,070
weren't they in the hobbit movies then

797
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:07,390
if you need a glass door for

798
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:08,890
it to be like well i mean

799
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,390
in in the way it is in

800
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:11,770
the habit they're okay with it being

801
00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:13,270
dark and the way it is i

802
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:14,920
i would like to have suddenly like

803
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:19,120
dark i don't know dark but it

804
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,140
was we got there and it was

805
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:21,490
like we pulled in we were like

806
00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:22,810
this can't be it like we we

807
00:28:22,810 --> 00:28:24,220
first liked joe passing a few times

808
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:26,380
because it was behind a house and

809
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:27,580
then we finally go okay i think

810
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:29,260
this is it we pull in and

811
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:31,330
there's like loser there's like a guy

812
00:28:31,330 --> 00:28:33,190
like with his truck like doing something

813
00:28:33,190 --> 00:28:33,430
at the

814
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:35,530
front house and it seemed likely a

815
00:28:35,530 --> 00:28:36,910
guy with his truck doing something at

816
00:28:36,910 --> 00:28:38,710
the front house yeah it's it just

817
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:40,960

818
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:42,880
we go okay she's lawyered i think

819
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,740

820
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:46,870
do you mean with his truck doing

821
00:28:46,870 --> 00:28:48,520
something okay so there was like a

822
00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:50,020
creepy truck parked in front of the

823
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:51,970

but this will be a ok and

863
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:14,920
it also was like short walk to

864
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,270
the beach not true at all it

865
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:17,530
was like a full drive and then

866
00:30:17,530 --> 00:30:18,550
when you got there like a million

867
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:19,630
cars you couldn't get so it's like

868
00:30:19,630 --> 00:30:21,670
the whole idea of the relaxing trip

869
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:22,870
was like none of it was gonna

870
00:30:22,870 --> 00:30:25,390
happen yeah and at this point we'd

871
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:25,750
already know

872
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:27,520
not been anywhere for you know a

873
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,840
year so it was like this was

874
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:29,920
supposed to be like a nice thing

875
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,960
but yeah we get there and then

876
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,220
we we find the place and we're

877
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:34,780
like ooh it feels kind of like

878
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:36,100
sketchy and weird and i was like

879
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:39,310
it was just like dirty feeling inside

880
00:30:39,850 --> 00:30:42,250
and like the uli idea of like

881
00:30:42,610 --> 00:30:44,920
i mean dvd of airbnb be like

882
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:45,907
beds is like such

883
00:30:46,530 --> 00:30:48,480
why because yes you need to know

884
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,100
that it's been like really clean it's

885
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:51,420
not like a hotel where it feels

886
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:54,930
like there's some more accountability slash they

887
00:30:54,930 --> 00:30:56,340
could always work place it very quickly

888
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:57,990
for yeah there's a mechanism in place

889
00:30:57,990 --> 00:31:01,080
there like with this i was like

890
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:02,370
i don't want to get on this

891
00:31:02,370 --> 00:31:03,990
bed like i feel like really like

892
00:31:04,170 --> 00:31:05,910
ooh about the bed and the dovey

893
00:31:05,910 --> 00:31:06,630
cupboard it was like

894
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:08,490
yeah and then the bathrooms where and

895
00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:09,480
then i was thinking about how i

896
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:10,890
had just learned about how some people

897
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:13,410
um have been filmed at the airbnbs

898
00:31:13,410 --> 00:31:14,460
and i was like there's definitely a

899
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:15,390
camera in here he was just like

900
00:31:15,570 --> 00:31:17,310
it was just like gross and then

901
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:18,540
we're like alright let's try to sit

902
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:19,769
outside and see if it's nice like

903
00:31:19,769 --> 00:31:20,880
if we sit outside because they were

904
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:23,160
like some lawn chairs and stuff and

905
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:25,200
we can't really win to every room

906
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:26,640
tried every well there's

907
00:31:26,850 --> 00:31:28,710
one room it was a shipping container

908
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:31,350
and then outside of that was um

909
00:31:31,530 --> 00:31:32,910
like a little patio area with some

910
00:31:32,910 --> 00:31:35,190
like you know furniture and we and

911
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:37,350
there were they were like metal wire

912
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:38,760
furniture that you could you said it

913
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,650
hurt we were like i can't even

914
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:43,500
relax on this and when i sit

915
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:44,610
on this i'm looking at the main

916
00:31:44,610 --> 00:31:46,440
house and i'm wondering what the fuck

917
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:46,980
is going on in there

918
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:49,200
share with those creeps with soames and

919
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,700
they're looking at me assume you know

920
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:54,420
presumably um so we then decided we

921
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:55,080
have to get the fuck out of

922
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,400
there we had brought our bags in

923
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,630
but then because we were like let's

924
00:31:57,630 --> 00:31:59,010
just do it and then were like

925
00:31:59,010 --> 00:31:59,850

948
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:38,910

00:32:38,910 --> 00:32:41,910
that comedy bang bang's yeah um but

950
00:32:41,910 --> 00:32:43,680

00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,810
not pay for it say it's dirty

952
00:32:45,810 --> 00:32:46,890

953
00:32:46,890 --> 00:32:47,460

954
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:48,840

little little little

977
00:33:38,910 --> 00:33:40,740

whole group of us went to hobbiton

979
00:33:42,930 --> 00:33:44,760
which is set up so nicely like

980
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:46,470
it's say they kept the sets from

981
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:48,090
the movie the exterior sets when they

982
00:33:48,095 --> 00:33:49,980
shot there and so you can't let

983
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:51,870
go in the hobbit houses but you

984
00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:54,450
walk around like the hobbit neighborhood and

985
00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:56,790

986
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:58,050

remember the legions commercial wow

1064
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:51,960
okay well it went a little something

1065
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:54,720
like this zakho like when your mind

1066
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,850
goes like when you're having fun but

1067
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,530
wait if i'm doing right up sir

1068
00:36:58,530 --> 00:37:00,170
but when your movie doesn't ability that

1069
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:01,680
it'll return to the theory that the

1070
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:02,940
bible is a whole thing

1071
00:37:04,410 --> 00:37:06,060
it was a commercial for lw for

1072
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,810
ninety two you'll find them all amortized

1073
00:37:07,811 --> 00:37:09,840
them lots of stuff enough to make

1074
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:12,390
you sick sago like when your mind

1075
00:37:12,390 --> 00:37:14,310
goes like what you've had enough of

1076
00:37:14,310 --> 00:37:16,380
doing grown-up stuff so when your lady

1077
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:18,030
you to do your job reba mobile

1078
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:20,340
the mobile way it was for adults

1079
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:23,610
like no it was for kids watch

1080
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:24,180
but

1081
00:37:24,270 --> 00:37:26,190
but what kids are doing adults grownup

1082
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:28,020
stuff you know like your chores i

1083
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:29,730
think the looney tunes should change their

1084
00:37:29,730 --> 00:37:31,440
name because that's it's not cool to

1085
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,600
say someone's insane anymore so you know

1086
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:35,070
to call can you say they're loony

1087
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:38,040
no that's even worse alouds calling someone

1088
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:41,220
in saying yeah alright switch jays they

1089
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:43,740

1236
00:42:54,290 --> 00:42:56,000
it feels it's like the nineties this

1237
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,820
movie possibly but like it feels like

1238
00:42:58,820 --> 00:42:59,690
you're in that

1239
00:43:01,581 --> 00:43:02,780

you want to be being that i

1242
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:08,750
know exactly what you mean and what's

1243
00:43:08,750 --> 00:43:11,360
funny is it doesn't feel good

1244
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:16,100
ah so it feels good from my

1245
00:43:16,130 --> 00:43:18,320
perspective because i'm like because because when

1246
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:20,000
i was in at that point in

1247
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,620
time i wanted to be an adult

1248
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:23,540
who worked in a bookstore doing middle

1249
00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:24,950
so that so but you were like

1250
00:43:24,950 --> 00:43:26,870
i hate this yeah this is like

1251
00:43:27,350 --> 00:43:29,690
it's a trope of the funny supporting

1252
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:31,760
character who's like works in a bookstore

1253
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:32,930
and you're always like what a cool

1254
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:34,310
life and they're always like bored and

1255
00:43:34,310 --> 00:43:37,160
disaffected yes and you go wow how

1256
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:38,600
cool would that be but no it

1257
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:40,700
sucks is what paul went when bridges

1258
00:43:40,730 --> 00:43:41,900
of madison county came out and i

1259
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:42,980
was working in that bookstore that was

1260
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:45,140
a true low point in my life

1261
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:47,570
where i'm highly glorifying it and you're

1262
00:43:47,606 --> 00:43:50,330

and takes such a hard fall it

1329
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:04,640
was like that that philip seymour hoffman

1330
00:46:04,670 --> 00:46:07,790
pratfall in ah ah along came polly

00:46:08,090 --> 00:46:11,030
it was hard and i had to

1332
00:46:11,030 --> 00:46:11,960
turn away because

1333
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:16,850
because this guy was such a dick

1334
00:46:16,850 --> 00:46:18,140
to me but he was also like

1335
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:19,730
he was such a door i felt

1336
00:46:19,730 --> 00:46:21,230
bad for why was he a dick

1337
00:46:21,230 --> 00:46:22,820
to you though was was it because

1338
00:46:22,820 --> 00:46:24,320
he didn't think you were as smart

1339
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:26,810
as him or just i'm sure that's

1340
00:46:26,810 --> 00:46:28,220
true but he also felt like i

1341
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:31,010
wasn't i wasn't as gung-ho an employee

1342
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:33,170

00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:34,310
he he could tell that i did

1344
00:46:34,310 --> 00:46:35,750
not take it as seriously as he

1345
00:46:35,750 --> 00:46:37,070
did and he always liked to tell

1346
00:46:37,070 --> 00:46:38,030
me what i was doing wrong or

1347
00:46:38,030 --> 00:46:39,500

00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:23,000
you fucking idiot

1467
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:25,610
well laura never did i told you

1468
00:50:25,610 --> 00:50:27,500
so you could imagine his little self

1469
00:50:27,860 --> 00:50:29,570
yes and i did i wanted you

1470
00:50:29,570 --> 00:50:32,060
to see him young white guy missing

1471
00:50:32,060 --> 00:50:34,430
two front teeth it's the same guy

1472
00:50:35,780 --> 00:50:37,430
so this this older white lady comes

1473
00:50:37,430 --> 00:50:38,390
up to the counter and says i

1474
00:50:38,390 --> 00:50:40,490
want to return this book because i

1475
00:50:40,490 --> 00:50:42,050
didn't realize that the people in it

1476
00:50:42,050 --> 00:50:44,780
were black oh she's buying it for

1477
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:46,460
and then like she i think i

1478
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:48,500
must have had like either a reactor

1479
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:49,970
there was like a moment of silence

1480
00:50:50,150 --> 00:50:52,190
and she said that's terrible isn't it

1481
00:50:53,540 --> 00:50:56,270
it's like yeah it is and you

1482
00:50:56,270 --> 00:50:58,160
also don't have to tell me this

1483
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:01,147
reason i could just yeah exactly you

1484
00:51:01,147 --> 00:51:02,870
could say i bought the wrong book

1485
00:51:02,930 --> 00:51:04,790
or some yeah that is so for

1486
00:51:04,790 --> 00:51:07,310
us as you remember it was called

1487
00:51:07,310 --> 00:51:11,330
the black family roots by lexical roots

1488
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:12,740
it was a children's book and it

1489
00:51:12,740 --> 00:51:13,430
was like it

1490
00:51:14,155 --> 00:51:16,375
black family doing whatever happens in a

1491
00:51:16,375 --> 00:51:17,935
children's book like a picture in a

1492
00:51:17,935 --> 00:51:20,665
journal anyway that's terrible we'd need to

1493
00:51:20,665 --> 00:51:21,985
take a break and we'll be right

1494

to whatever that was gonna be i

1606

thought maybe it could be first magazine

1607
00:56:09,265 --> 00:56:11,275
like i said then i thought maybe

1608
00:56:12,985 --> 00:56:14,905
maybe some candy like sour patch kids

1609
00:56:15,085 --> 00:56:16,525
or i don't know if something really

1610
00:56:16,525 --> 00:56:18,385
cool like your old baseball uniform

1611
00:56:19,795 --> 00:56:23,695

00:56:23,995 --> 00:56:27,115
there's nothing under there and underwear

1613
00:56:29,515 --> 00:56:31,915
that didn't work i know i was

1614
00:56:31,915 --> 00:56:33,625

this is an intervention look ding dong

1619
00:56:45,895 --> 00:56:47,035
we're tired of you coming over to

1620
00:56:47,035 --> 00:56:49,015
our house every day and not ringing

1621
00:56:49,015 --> 00:56:50,335
the bell and we wanted to ring

1622
00:56:50,335 --> 00:56:50,695
the bell

1623
00:56:52,525 --> 00:56:54,865
let me get this straight so you

1624
00:56:54,925 --> 00:56:56,035
are tired of me coming over every

1625
00:56:56,035 --> 00:56:57,205
day and not ringing the bell but

1626
00:56:57,205 --> 00:56:58,315
you liked that i come over every

1627
00:56:58,315 --> 00:56:59,185
day you just want me to ring

1628
00:56:59,185 --> 00:57:00,385
the bell so if i were to

1629
00:57:00,385 --> 00:57:02,545
come over and go ding dong that

1630
00:57:02,545 --> 00:57:02,965

1631
00:57:05,755 --> 00:57:09,895
definitely better but i wouldn't say good

1632
00:57:09,925 --> 00:57:13,855
necessarily you see a big part of

1633
00:57:13,855 --> 00:57:15,265
the problem is is we also don't

1634
00:57:15,265 --> 00:57:16,405
like you coming over every day

1635
00:57:17,545 --> 00:57:19,225

1636
00:57:22,225 --> 00:57:23,815
tell you the truth no

1637
00:57:25,825 --> 00:57:27,775
okay this is also difficult to say

1638
00:57:27,775 --> 00:57:28,765
but we don't want to be your

1639
00:57:28,765 --> 00:57:30,355
friend anymore ding-dong we're tired of you

00:57:37,825 --> 00:57:38,125
us

1644
00:57:40,165 --> 00:57:41,515

1647
00:57:46,045 --> 00:57:48,655
something going on here something a little

1648
00:57:48,655 --> 00:57:50,515
deeper than what we have all three

1649
00:57:50,515 --> 00:57:53,335
of us together and i want you

1650
00:57:53,335 --> 00:57:54,745
to see once and for all admitted

1651
00:57:54,805 --> 00:57:56,815
you sleep in that top bunk and

1652
00:57:56,815 --> 00:57:59,125
you sleep in that bottom bunk and

1653
00:57:59,125 --> 00:58:00,955
it's much more than just that you're

1654
00:58:00,955 --> 00:58:03,475
not just roommates you're not just friends

1655
00:58:04,405 --> 00:58:05,155
you're married

1656
00:58:07,795 --> 00:58:08,275
to

1657
00:58:10,465 --> 00:58:13,525
to to ting die how did you

1658
00:58:13,945 --> 00:58:16,885
how did you guess yes we are

1659
00:58:17,095 --> 00:58:20,575
in a committed marital relationship

1660
00:58:22,405 --> 00:58:25,765
perhaps you're not comfortable with that i

1661
00:58:25,975 --> 00:58:27,475
i've always felt like you didn't want

1662
00:58:27,475 --> 00:58:28,795
to be our friend because of that

1663
00:58:30,205 --> 00:58:31,495
to tell you the truth it's more

1664
00:58:31,495 --> 00:58:33,805
that i just felt left out and

1665
00:58:34,375 --> 00:58:35,904
i always thought we were just a

1666
00:58:35,904 --> 00:58:37,945
three group of friends but it turns

1667
00:58:37,945 --> 00:58:39,985
out it's a two marriage and a

1668
00:58:39,985 --> 00:58:42,325
one friend and that's a third wheel

1669
00:58:45,325 --> 00:58:48,685
lolly gagging around like this we should

1670
00:58:48,685 --> 00:58:50,275
have been more careful scott

1671
00:58:53,605 --> 00:58:56,455
time has taught me that

1672
00:58:57,595 --> 00:59:00,145
you know friends will be friends forever

1673
00:59:00,805 --> 00:59:06,115
but marriages can end and i want

1674
00:59:06,115 --> 00:59:07,165
to end this marriage paul

1675
00:59:09,055 --> 00:59:12,205
lookie here my dream is coming true

1676
00:59:13,795 --> 00:59:16,615
except i'm not too happy about this

1677
00:59:16,615 --> 00:59:18,745
because i don't want to be divorced

1678
00:59:18,805 --> 00:59:20,785

1680
00:59:26,065 --> 00:59:29,005
let's see ah i don't think there's

1681
00:59:29,005 --> 00:59:30,865
any shame in being divorced i think

1682
00:59:30,895 --> 00:59:32,755
it's just when a man doesn't love

1683
00:59:32,755 --> 00:59:34,465
a man anymore we should just end

1684
00:59:34,465 --> 00:59:36,775

1685
00:59:36,775 --> 00:59:38,575
