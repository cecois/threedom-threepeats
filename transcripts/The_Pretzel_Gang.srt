00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:57,840
some halloween costume like a ready-made halloween

160
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,600

161
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,030

164
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:08,940
seeing this thing so well and thinking

165
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:10,830
oh my god she's gonna because we

166
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:12,870
were having a costume party at school

00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,490
i was like she's gonna wear that

168
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:16,200
she's gonna wear that i became convinced

169
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:17,788
thought she was going to where it

170
00:06:17,788 --> 00:06:19,410
was like she is the diet she's

171
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:20,880
the type of person that is going

172
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:21,990
that would do a thing like this

173
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:23,580
because i wanted to awesome was or

174
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:25,170
the size of the head because of

175
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:26,400
because the costume was such

176
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:28,860
a dorky thing and i was saying

177
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:31,290
your yoshi do that because here's your

178
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:33,030
concern for i was concerned for her

179
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,680
the costume was like they they just

180
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:37,200
made up characters they weren't like established

181
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,939
character that they just made up a

182
00:06:38,939 --> 00:06:40,020
thing i was like no kid would

183
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:41,520
ever want this and was that's okay

184
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,440
what if she does that i was

185
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,750
not so much that i would prince

186
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,220

653
00:21:52,605 --> 00:21:54,933
old principle of anytime you go to

654
00:21:54,945 --> 00:21:56,445
a restaurant i mean my own principle

655
00:21:57,855 --> 00:21:59,385
anytime you go to a restaurant because

656
00:22:00,255 --> 00:22:02,295
you're paying attention anytime you go to

657
00:22:02,295 --> 00:22:03,825
a restaurant and there's no one in

658
00:22:03,825 --> 00:22:05,925
it you get worse service than when

659
00:22:05,985 --> 00:22:07,965
they're like who cares because they because

660
00:22:07,965 --> 00:22:09,705
they're fucking around in the kitchen they're

661
00:22:09,705 --> 00:22:11,985
just like doing drugs yeah i've seen

664
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:17,565
new service room

665
00:22:17,895 --> 00:22:20,625

the other day and i was and

746
00:24:45,615 --> 00:24:47,565
at one point this is a minor

747
00:24:47,565 --> 00:24:49,995
minor spoiler ah gwen verdon is in

748
00:24:49,995 --> 00:24:52,695
a show that cancelled after the first

749
00:24:52,695 --> 00:24:57,105
performance and i cannot imagine that feeling

750
00:24:57,255 --> 00:24:58,665
that with it being so raw a

751
00:24:58,665 --> 00:25:00,648
show where like they like put it

752
00:25:00,795 --> 00:25:02,535
work on it for more money put

753
00:25:02,535 --> 00:25:04,365
it up in like it's a lie

754
00:25:04,455 --> 00:25:05,925
and they were like we got we

755
00:25:05,925 --> 00:25:07,335
caught wind that the reviews were going

756
00:25:07,335 --> 00:25:09,045
to be really bad and ticket sales

757
00:25:09,045 --> 00:25:11,565
were soft and so well ah cancelled

758
00:25:11,595 --> 00:25:13,455
after one performance that's hurt i can

759
00:25:13,455 --> 00:25:15,735
not imagine i mean i guess tv

760
00:25:15,735 --> 00:25:17,235
shows that happens like wonderful as i

761
00:25:17,235 --> 00:25:19,245
think it was on once and then

762
00:25:19,245 --> 00:25:20,655
it was canceled even though they'd filmed

763
00:25:20,655 --> 00:25:20,925
thirty

764
00:25:20,925 --> 00:25:22,605
and a lot of shelter girls era

765
00:25:23,025 --> 00:25:24,135
i think they only aired like one

766
00:25:24,135 --> 00:25:25,725
or two no i i watched it

767
00:25:25,815 --> 00:25:28,425
yeah on real tv on dvd no

768
00:25:28,425 --> 00:25:29,295
i watched it as a thing

769
00:25:30,345 --> 00:25:32,235
he watched i will say i saw

770
00:25:32,265 --> 00:25:34,845
the ah the tv show emily emily's

771
00:25:34,845 --> 00:25:37,095
reasons why not which only aired once

772
00:25:37,725 --> 00:25:39,375
and i saw the one that aired

773
00:25:39,945 --> 00:25:41,775
and it's weirdly makes me mad that

774
00:25:41,775 --> 00:25:44,175
i saw like come on like my

775
00:25:44,175 --> 00:25:46,065
feeling about that is just to air

776
00:25:46,065 --> 00:25:48,690
them all you made them all just

777
00:25:48,705 --> 00:25:49,306
air them

778
00:25:51,285 --> 00:25:53,325
canceling a show and not finishing what's

779
00:25:53,325 --> 00:25:54,945
already at least play the ones you

780
00:25:54,945 --> 00:25:56,595
already made was the point of all

781
00:25:56,595 --> 00:25:58,245

well it just reminded me of like

817
00:27:15,165 --> 00:27:16,335
if you're not a person if you're

818
00:27:16,335 --> 00:27:18,225
just an actor who's like acting in

819
00:27:18,225 --> 00:27:19,635
front of cameras all the time like

820
00:27:19,665 --> 00:27:20,445
how that would

821
00:27:20,445 --> 00:27:22,815
i'd be very nerve wracking it's nerve

822
00:27:22,815 --> 00:27:24,345
wracking anyway oh yeah well yeah i

823
00:27:24,345 --> 00:27:25,695
mean it's nerve wracking enough for us

824
00:27:25,695 --> 00:27:26,805
of like who are used to going

825
00:27:26,805 --> 00:27:28,635
out in front of crowds but for

826
00:27:28,635 --> 00:27:30,645
him it's just or a person like

827
00:27:30,645 --> 00:27:32,055
that who's just a film actor doing

828
00:27:32,055 --> 00:27:33,975
those shows is like it shouldn't be

829
00:27:33,975 --> 00:27:35,899
that hard they don't make them easy

830
00:27:35,899 --> 00:27:37,425
guys you know they don't do this

831
00:27:37,425 --> 00:27:39,465
a greener i think his middle name

832
00:27:39,465 --> 00:27:40,545
is leanna ringer

833
00:27:40,635 --> 00:27:41,715
look at him rinder look at the

834
00:27:41,745 --> 00:27:43,395
picture right above it i think he's

835
00:27:43,425 --> 00:27:45,795
grinning like a motherfucker make them more

836
00:27:45,795 --> 00:27:47,925
facility last names i think i like

837
00:27:47,925 --> 00:27:49,455
when jimmy fallon plays a game with

838
00:27:49,455 --> 00:27:51,015
somebody like to see people loosen up

839
00:27:51,015 --> 00:27:52,575
a little bit yeah i like to

840
00:27:52,575 --> 00:27:54,795
see people stretching beforehand i like that

841
00:27:54,795 --> 00:27:56,025
would be that's the show

842
00:27:57,675 --> 00:27:59,325
i like people stretching him i think

843
00:27:59,355 --> 00:28:01,425
ah i'm being a leotard i think

844
00:28:01,425 --> 00:28:03,015
the conversation should be looser and the

845
00:28:03,015 --> 00:28:04,545
people shouldn't be expected to sit and

846
00:28:04,545 --> 00:28:06,015
be like this this should be a

847
00:28:06,015 --> 00:28:08,115
show yeah this is real little be

848
00:28:08,115 --> 00:28:09,585
a show i tell you something i

849
00:28:09,615 --> 00:28:11,205
i i feel like i always do

850
00:28:11,205 --> 00:28:12,675
very badly on talk shows i'm not

851
00:28:12,675 --> 00:28:15,225
a good panelist feels hard what happens

852
00:28:15,225 --> 00:28:17,295
is i think that i

853
00:28:17,355 --> 00:28:20,775
think a lot of times the audience

854
00:28:20,835 --> 00:28:22,245
like the the people who are who

855
00:28:22,245 --> 00:28:23,835
are producing the show know who i

856
00:28:23,835 --> 00:28:25,725
am but the audience has no idea

857
00:28:25,755 --> 00:28:27,675
alright so it's a weird i'm in

858
00:28:27,675 --> 00:28:30,045
this weird twilight place where you talk

859
00:28:30,045 --> 00:28:31,185
about national be funny but it's like

860
00:28:31,215 --> 00:28:32,072
i don't think it's gonna be funny

861
00:28:32,385 --> 00:28:34,815
they don't have a basis yeah why

862
00:28:34,845 --> 00:28:36,165
why would they be interested in a

863
00:28:36,165 --> 00:28:37,485
baby pale where you meet you

864
00:28:37,485 --> 00:28:39,135

865
00:28:39,795 --> 00:28:43,515
you've seen it yeah yeah you're right

866
00:28:43,515 --> 00:28:44,955
i feel like i always bomb and

867
00:28:44,955 --> 00:28:46,905
it's always awkward and i feel really

868
00:28:48,735 --> 00:28:49,935
but i want to get good i'm

869
00:28:49,935 --> 00:28:51,435

870
00:28:51,435 --> 00:28:53,085
be good i feel i get too

871
00:28:53,115 --> 00:28:54,675
nervous i can see a version of

872
00:28:54,675 --> 00:28:56,715
my life where i eventually become or

873
00:28:56,715 --> 00:28:59,595
left it's firing at them like i

874
00:28:59,595 --> 00:29:00,945
wanna be like amy sedaris which just

875
00:29:00,945 --> 00:29:02,265
goes out and does whatever she wants

876
00:29:02,265 --> 00:29:03,795
but people already know that and expect

877
00:29:03,795 --> 00:29:05,385
that that's the thing i would prefer

878
00:29:05,385 --> 00:29:06,615
to like what i'd like to do

879
00:29:06,615 --> 00:29:08,175

00:29:08,205 --> 00:29:09,765
mastodon is go out and do a

881
00:29:09,765 --> 00:29:11,295
bit like steve martin used to do

yes that's but no one knows who

883
00:29:13,155 --> 00:29:14,475
i am so i can't do that

884
00:29:14,475 --> 00:29:16,815
stuff so when you luana i mana

885
00:29:16,815 --> 00:29:18,405
talk show you've got to explain who

886
00:29:18,405 --> 00:29:21,015

887
00:29:21,045 --> 00:29:23,565
this is very relatable it's very relatable

be their smugness it's hard to tell

1210
00:41:05,310 --> 00:41:06,780
if this is a choice or if

1211
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:07,890
they're really mad that they had to

1212
00:41:07,890 --> 00:41:10,260
make this video and every time they

1213
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:11,190

1214
00:41:11,190 --> 00:41:13,380
devil to replace her a guy walks

1215
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:13,710

up some fake money

1219
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,176
laziest video i've ever seen in my

1220
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:26,010

1221
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:27,870
how long does the song yeah exactly

1222
00:41:28,410 --> 00:41:30,600
always get the reacted on to play

1223
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:31,920
the guitar for so should we do

1224
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,360
another take of this

1225
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:37,500
no we got it i mean i

1226
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:39,690
will say that they look cooler than

1227
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:42,180
covering his hand there's knowing he's actually

1228
00:41:42,930 --> 00:41:45,217
because darryl hawley kinda looks like bowie

1229
00:41:45,217 --> 00:41:47,220
you see he's got a bowie hairstyle

1230
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:48,750

00:41:56,610 --> 00:41:58,650
do with all of it all videos

1235
00:41:58,650 --> 00:42:00,510

1263
00:42:54,870 --> 00:42:56,609

00:43:13,560 --> 00:43:14,700
and he doesn't notice her for the

1273
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:16,560
longest time and then he she finally

1274
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:17,760

1275
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:19,410
