sometimes it can be too big okay

516

if so if size matters it does

517
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,710
it's not the emotion of the antlers

518
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:05,290
he um i liked that show because

519
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:07,750

520
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:08,830
at grownups as well

521
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:11,290
a lot about it i didn't understand

522
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:13,030

523
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:14,530

that the piano i've never seen the

527
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,110
piano what's that about a man who

528
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:24,910
can't speak but plays the piano it's

529
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:25,990
about a woman who can't speak yet

530
00:18:26,001 --> 00:18:26,530
sexist

531
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,530
yes the piano player was a woman

532
00:18:31,266 --> 00:18:33,100

a son

777
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:45,810
today so i ended up going to

778
00:26:45,810 --> 00:26:47,580
like the gas station and just like

779
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:49,710
going like oh my okay what is

780
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:51,570
here that i could buy so it

781
00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:53,100
was like here's a gallon of gas

782
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:53,970
ma it was like i would be

783
00:26:53,970 --> 00:26:54,210
good

784
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,970
actually i'm going to use it no

785
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:57,930
i would take that but it was

786
00:26:57,930 --> 00:27:01,740
like you know those ah coca-cola cozies

787
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:03,330
yeah you know like they were really

788
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:05,400
beer cozies probably is but like oh

789
00:27:05,401 --> 00:27:06,780

790
00:27:06,810 --> 00:27:08,940
cool it's like stuff i obviously got

791
00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:12,210
it's like yes station city rapid it's

792
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:14,490
like a comparably not i'm horrible at

793
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:14,970
writing

794
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,830
to the point where now they would

795
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:18,570
much rather not even wrapping gifts i

796
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:20,550
even know you cannot wrap a gift

797
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:22,950
well it i could if i took

798
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:24,660
the time but it's such a waste

799
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:26,040
of time i just hate you think

800
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:28,020
it's likely probably be the best at

801
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:29,370
it you know what you're you'd be

802
00:27:29,370 --> 00:27:31,500
the best if you got your future

803
00:27:31,530 --> 00:27:33,840
tripping thinking about the the wrapping being

804
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,460
torn i know that sounds so you're

805
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:35,610
not

806
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,530
putting your focus into god that's sad

807
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:38,970
it's sad sad man

808
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:41,670

809
00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:42,990

810
00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:45,120

is a fantastic gift wrapper it's actually

812
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:48,420
the point of most of the gifts

813
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:51,720

814
00:27:51,810 --> 00:27:52,980

a row you push you you've got

867
00:29:47,490 --> 00:29:50,550
everything you put the paper down pattern

868
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:52,350

about the crease that keeps it from

875
00:30:03,330 --> 00:30:05,010
flopping you crease it very tightly then

876
00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:07,230
you tape a piece of the tape

877
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:08,400
and the piece of the vapor to

878
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,720
the president i've done them then it

879
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,130

880
00:30:11,130 --> 00:30:12,030
to look at the corner to go

881
00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:13,290
really tight and you

00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:07,439
you did right yeah it may be

1339
00:46:07,439 --> 00:46:09,530
maybe neurological issue could be

1340
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:13,340
your brain cognitive up into a prune

1341
00:46:13,580 --> 00:46:17,210
nat she's getting smoother zak's eagle portman

1342
00:46:17,330 --> 00:46:20,510
portman totally awesome do you see i

1343
00:46:20,510 --> 00:46:23,720
do portman totally awesome it's a memory

1344
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:25,309
game in which the players build on

1345
00:46:25,309 --> 00:46:27,590
a collection of words slash phrases by

1346
00:46:27,590 --> 00:46:30,200
adding on a portmanteau a word that

1347
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:30,860
builds on the last

1348
00:46:30,860 --> 00:46:32,656
the sound of the previous word not

1349
00:46:32,656 --> 00:46:34,070
technically what a portmanteau is but no

1350
00:46:34,070 --> 00:46:35,780
it's not the edition doesn't need to

1351
00:46:35,780 --> 00:46:38,240
make sense as a coherent thought each

1352
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:40,130
player repeats the entire collection of words

1353
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:42,230
or phrases before adding their own which

1354
00:46:42,230 --> 00:46:44,030
gets more more difficult as it gets

1355
00:46:44,030 --> 00:46:46,850
longer and now we're going to start

1356
00:46:47,420 --> 00:46:49,430

1357
00:46:49,430 --> 00:46:50,960

1361
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:58,760

1364
00:47:03,170 --> 00:47:06,140
these are progressive lenses so i have

1365
00:47:06,140 --> 00:47:08,480
progressives as well transitions i was told

1366
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:10,699
no transitions are oh that's what my

1367
00:47:10,699 --> 00:47:13,100
sunglass progressives they are tinted if everyone

1368
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:13,340
out there

1369
00:47:13,340 --> 00:47:14,600
there are two the privilege to laugh

1370
00:47:15,110 --> 00:47:17,690
but progressives have three layers top middle

1371
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:17,960
bottom

1372
00:47:19,430 --> 00:47:21,680
ah yeah i think so i think

1373
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:22,520
they do i mean you look out

1374
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:23,930
the middle but i don't think there's

1375
00:47:23,930 --> 00:47:25,550
a special layer there's like two like

1376
00:47:25,550 --> 00:47:27,800
resistance and then close yeah too there's

1377
00:47:27,830 --> 00:47:31,340
some fine vocals essentially okay yeah but

1378
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:32,540

1397
00:48:08,270 --> 00:48:09,260
years and years and then one day

i was doing a podcast with them

1399
00:48:10,550 --> 00:48:11,840

1428
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:16,070
to realize this was a bad dude

1429
00:49:16,460 --> 00:49:17,900

it's like this guy was horrible buying

1433
00:49:24,347 --> 00:49:25,790
my way over to the church but

1434
00:49:25,790 --> 00:49:26,990
here's why i thought of him because

1435
00:49:26,990 --> 00:49:28,790
he would he wore glasses and sometimes

1436
00:49:28,790 --> 00:49:30,228
he would take like hang out on

1437
00:49:30,228 --> 00:49:32,000
our house he's over for dinner a

1438
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,650
lot of stuff you take off his

1439
00:49:33,650 --> 00:49:35,990
glasses and he would hold a newspaper

1440
00:49:35,990 --> 00:49:37,970
like an inch from his

1441
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:42,440
why was it your house because he

1442
00:49:42,890 --> 00:49:43,880
had nowhere else to go i guess

1443
00:49:43,910 --> 00:49:45,440
but he was wait he's a lonely

1444
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:47,780
creep down what day on what day

1445
00:49:47,810 --> 00:49:48,080
but

1446
00:49:49,370 --> 00:49:50,750
was it a holiday but day was

1447
00:49:50,750 --> 00:49:52,070
this now you would be our followers

1448
00:49:52,070 --> 00:49:53,060
but he would be there my mom

1449
00:49:53,060 --> 00:49:54,260
would invite him he's there all the

1450
00:49:54,290 --> 00:49:55,671
time he's there a lot he's there

1451
00:49:55,671 --> 00:49:56,900
a line he would read the paper

1452
00:49:56,900 --> 00:49:59,030
one inch from his face one inch

1453
00:49:59,150 --> 00:50:00,950
but why but why didn't need glasses

1454
00:50:00,950 --> 00:50:01,940
to help them read the he didn't

1455
00:50:01,940 --> 00:50:03,110
have glasses but he would take the

1456
00:50:03,110 --> 00:50:04,640
glasses off and he would hold you

1457
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:05,840
to hold a rapid change from his

1458
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:08,237
