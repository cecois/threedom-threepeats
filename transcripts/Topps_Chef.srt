basically had to do it unprompted and

51
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:54,690
then because he realized he should just

52
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:56,580
be truthful with them because susie was

53
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:58,380
so disturbed by it that maybe other

54
00:01:58,380 --> 00:01:59,757
people would also be disturbed so i

55
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:00,960
told them it was like stick around

56
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,820

begged me to stay because you wanted

107
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:23,220
it to be your decision not mine

108
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:24,840
you wanted all the power you know

109
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,300
she just like expertly she was to

110
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,062
kill it about the whole situation and

111
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:30,210
it was objects i would've been like

112
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,250
euro dick head

113
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:37,710
your head is maybe isaac hot but

114
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:39,480
i wish that the idea of them

115
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,520
being double bachelorette i sort of feel

116
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,750
like could get dicey if they're dating

117
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,520
the same pool of men they say

118
00:03:44,605 --> 00:03:46,320
the creator says that's not gonna happen

119
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:47,160
okay because i want them to have

120
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,020
two separate houses with different men and

121
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,120
then they supposed divided cannot stand the

122
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,280
women sleep in the same house between

123
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:53,520
the two

124
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,470
houses and kind of recap and help

125
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:57,690
each other and coach oh like like

126
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,360
one divorce couples buy they get one

127
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:02,880
house that's where the child lives yeah

128
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:03,930
and then they take turns living there

129
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:06,390
yeah what an interesting idea that is

130
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,280
definitely true what a piece of work

131
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:08,400
is

132
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:12,240
there was a there was a producer

133
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,650
who pitched me the idea for a

134
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:14,910
movie that he wanted me to write

135
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:16,906
robert evans this is remind me yes

136
00:04:17,107 --> 00:04:18,690
it was robert evan i can't remember

137
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:19,590
who it is but it was the

138
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:21,210
craziest pitch i'd ever heard he was

139
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:23,490
like alright so you know how reality

140
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,110
tv is really sounds like a producer

141
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:28,110
i'm doing virtual reality seems a bit

142
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:29,640
like alright here we let me take

143
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:29,760
my

144
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:31,860
go around okay i'm also from the

145
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,570
east coast if you can't good let

146
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:35,340
me take my val choices up from

147
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:38,580
becky's reality tv very big so he's

148
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:41,580
like okay so there are there are

149
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:45,570
shoes there were two houses alright and

150
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:48,360
the the movies called three hundred i

151
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,830
think this is before oh no

152
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:52,470
must be called two hundred know it

153
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:53,610
had to be three one hundred but

154
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:55,680
if it's doi her and this is

155
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,480
before the movie three hundred oh he

156
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:00,210
must have been pissed okay so was

157
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:02,220
it three it must be three high

158
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,150
recall that

159
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:06,090
so to help you figure it out

160
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:08,760
so he's like alright there's two houses

161
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:11,670
maybe it was doing anyway let's go

162
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:14,580
huh i'll just keep saying that the

163
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,639
plot day will come where i will

164
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,640
jump into the pool

165
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:20,790
so it's ah so it's two houses

166
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:24,210
and in one house there's three hundred

167
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:27,660
people and they're all divorced and they're

168
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,540
always in one kid in one house

169
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:32,310
it's people who are who all weigh

170
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:34,800
one hundred pounds what and then in

171
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,990
the other house it's all people who

172
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:38,640
weigh three hundred per

173
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:41,850
pounds what does this idea and then

174
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:44,550
the goal is for them to lose

175
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,710
it's it was ten people right so

176
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:48,060
maybe it was a thousand so it

177
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:49,740
was like the goal is for all

178
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:51,300
for all of them to either lose

179
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:54,390
or gain as close to a thousand

180
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:56,430
pounds oh yeah obviously it was called

181
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:58,785
a thousand so it's probably i

182
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,473
no and had a weird guy it

183
00:06:00,473 --> 00:06:02,130
was the weirdest close-ups i'm like movie

184
00:06:02,392 --> 00:06:03,630
as a movie and he's like an

185
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:05,940
obviously like they they have relationships i

186
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:08,670

562
00:19:01,345 --> 00:19:03,895
thinking this means that every i p

563
00:19:03,895 --> 00:19:06,535
in the world every product is fodder

564
00:19:06,565 --> 00:19:09,205

596
00:20:10,165 --> 00:20:10,735

812
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:10,530
like this is disturbing i'm like why

813
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:12,300

814
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:15,390

00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:21,000
people with baby bodies and adult people

818
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,980
were saying it's a consent issue like

819
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:24,780
to hold your friend says i'm like

820
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:27,120

you consent baby likes to be held

822
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:30,300

824
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:32,760

841
00:27:58,890 --> 00:28:01,110
a ah issue with the fact that

00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:02,760
they were held by various people when

right now why do they make the

1067
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:42,150
this thin toilet paper it has no

1068
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:45,090

1069
00:35:45,090 --> 00:35:45,570
bad plumbing

humanity yeah because the next person doesn't

1132
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:46,470

1139
00:37:58,290 --> 00:38:00,750
like i've done it relatively recently like

1140
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:02,430
why like within the last seven years

1141
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:04,050
like you are like oh wow we're

1142
00:38:04,050 --> 00:38:05,520

00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,770
don't really get blackout i don't remember

1144
00:38:07,770 --> 00:38:09,450
what situation it was but i remember

1145
00:38:09,450 --> 00:38:10,890
being in a starbucks and going like

1146
00:38:10,890 --> 00:38:12,510
well i guess i gotta steal this

1147
00:38:13,530 --> 00:38:15,245

1148
00:38:15,245 --> 00:38:18,000
walk gorda cbs i can't remember what

1149
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,130
situation i was in maybe this was

1150
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:22,830
i was going through like terrible times

1151
00:38:22,830 --> 00:38:23,970
back in like two thousand and two

1152
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:25,470
so maybe it was his long long

1153
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:27,270
time ago compared to seven years yeah

1154
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:28,950
no but yeah maybe it just feels

1155
00:38:28,950 --> 00:38:31,020
like seven but yeah it's terrible time

1156
00:38:31,171 --> 00:38:33,030

but but it was it was one

1171
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,180
of those situations where it was like

1172
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:08,370

ah

1188
00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:36,030
it's like why also the government can't

1189
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:37,950
make you what is that called on

1190
00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:40,800
attitude recently gone i go saying i

1191
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,120
did but i read there there is

1192
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:44,310
a certain group of like libertarianism oh

1193
00:39:44,310 --> 00:39:45,540
yes like there's no such thing as

1194
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:47,190
tax there's no such thing as taxes

1195
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:50,580
that that in fact like speeding tickets

1196
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:51,690
and stuff like that they can't make

1197
00:39:51,690 --> 00:39:53,550
you do that right um

1198
00:39:53,877 --> 00:39:54,840
there was one that i saw there

1199
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:57,240
was like ah when the officer gives

1200
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:58,770
you a ticket they need to say

1201
00:39:58,772 --> 00:40:01,560
that they're a collection agency ah and

1202
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:03,240
if they don't do that then then

1203
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:04,680
legally you are not allowed to pay

1204
00:40:04,830 --> 00:40:06,630
like all these fucking weird wackos who

1205
00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:08,340
think that here's what i think yeah

1206
00:40:08,370 --> 00:40:11,070
is that speeding tickets yes there's there

1207
00:40:11,070 --> 00:40:12,210
should be a ticket for that like

1208
00:40:12,210 --> 00:40:13,860
that's dangerous right you're in

1209
00:40:13,942 --> 00:40:17,160
injuring people yeah parking ticket unless it's

1210
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:19,350
like urine like like by a hydrant

1211
00:40:20,370 --> 00:40:23,130
every parking ticket should be ten bucks

1212
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,840
you'd i feel like you'd make so

1213
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:26,370
much more much our parking but then

1214
00:40:26,370 --> 00:40:28,857
people there like seventy dollars sometimes but

1215
00:40:28,857 --> 00:40:30,630
that's partly why people depend on what

1216
00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:32,010
the what the thing is you know

1217
00:40:32,010 --> 00:40:33,690
well here's because it was ten everyone

1218
00:40:33,690 --> 00:40:34,680
would just be doing an old yeah

1219
00:40:34,710 --> 00:40:36,600
exactly but they make more money here's

1220
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:39,240
the theory that people say is like

1221
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:40,470
would you pay

1222
00:40:41,154 --> 00:40:42,865
an eighty dollars to park wherever you

1223
00:40:42,865 --> 00:40:45,325
wanted right in the city anytime right

1224
00:40:45,685 --> 00:40:47,635
and we'll just never pay for a

1225
00:40:47,635 --> 00:40:49,405
meter and you'll get like four parking

1226
00:40:49,405 --> 00:40:51,865
tickets a year and ah but so

1227
00:40:51,865 --> 00:40:53,935
that's two eighty per year yeah it's

1228
00:40:53,935 --> 00:40:55,765
like two dollars two hundred and eighty

1229
00:40:55,765 --> 00:40:57,205
dollars to park where ever you want

1230
00:40:57,205 --> 00:40:59,785
in the city for free yeah i

1231
00:40:59,785 --> 00:41:01,225
mean it adds up here

1232
00:41:01,525 --> 00:41:03,914
it's the most it does yeah and

1233
00:41:03,976 --> 00:41:05,305

stop having fun there was a certain

1350
00:45:21,055 --> 00:45:23,395
con okay what would do what was

1351
00:45:23,395 --> 00:45:24,625
your role that he should run the

1352
00:45:24,625 --> 00:45:27,445
dropout oh well i i later saw

1353
00:45:27,445 --> 00:45:30,265
it being played by this actor william

1354
00:45:30,265 --> 00:45:30,895
h macy

1355
00:45:32,395 --> 00:45:36,385
disgraced actor ah william h he was

1356
00:45:36,385 --> 00:45:38,635
barely disgraced helping me grady go to

1357
00:45:38,635 --> 00:45:40,495
jail because he let his wife take

1358
00:45:40,495 --> 00:45:41,965
things on one of those calls i

1359
00:45:41,965 --> 00:45:43,645
remember that very vividly at least one

1360
00:45:43,645 --> 00:45:44,985
of those talk about famous but but

1361
00:45:44,985 --> 00:45:46,315
but but but it's true we'll never

1362
00:45:46,315 --> 00:45:48,445
get them as guess that's so funny

1363
00:45:48,475 --> 00:45:50,245
addition for that yeah why did they

1364
00:45:50,245 --> 00:45:51,685
do that i don't know if they're

1365
00:45:51,685 --> 00:45:52,105
looking for

1366
00:45:52,165 --> 00:45:53,695
backup if they can't afford the person

1367
00:45:53,695 --> 00:45:55,280
they actually want and then i tried

1368
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:56,755
to do the i know that it's

1369
00:45:57,094 --> 00:45:58,825
just far and wide it's up but

1370
00:45:58,825 --> 00:46:00,745
if if the if your starting point

1371
00:46:00,745 --> 00:46:02,575
is william h macy or whatever a

1372
00:46:02,575 --> 00:46:04,525
few people who are very very famous

1373
00:46:04,915 --> 00:46:06,670
you before you get to me like

1374
00:46:06,685 --> 00:46:09,445
ok i guess remember when absolutely everyone

1375
00:46:09,864 --> 00:46:11,635
but marilyn mers-cov is the wife where

1376
00:46:11,635 --> 00:46:11,995
it's like

1377
00:46:12,325 --> 00:46:14,845
that would be a great pairing shy

1378
00:46:14,995 --> 00:46:16,405
i think so i would have had

1379
00:46:16,405 --> 00:46:18,265
a ball being her husband on that

1380
00:46:18,265 --> 00:46:22,255
show life men didn't like me dead

1381
00:46:22,255 --> 00:46:24,955
live i'm so sorry remember when famous

1382
00:46:24,955 --> 00:46:26,785
people would turn down roles and were

1383
00:46:26,785 --> 00:46:29,065
choosy now yeah exactly now they get

1384
00:46:29,095 --> 00:46:30,955
and then roles were like available for

1385
00:46:30,955 --> 00:46:32,485
people like yeah and hell they now

1386
00:46:32,515 --> 00:46:34,675
they take anything yeah because everything is

1387
00:46:34,855 --> 00:46:37,105
everything is only five episode everything five

1388
00:46:37,105 --> 00:46:39,835
episodes there's no um judgment about doing

1389
00:46:39,835 --> 00:46:42,625
tv like they're yeah exactly exactly yeah

1390
00:46:42,865 --> 00:46:44,875

and i was like and and the

1400
00:47:07,045 --> 00:47:09,055
notes were so specific it's like we're

1401
00:47:09,055 --> 00:47:11,185
trying to match the voice of the

1402
00:47:11,185 --> 00:47:14,485
nineteen forties pinocchio jiminy cricket and

1403
00:47:14,575 --> 00:47:15,925
um here's what it sounds like the

1404
00:47:15,925 --> 00:47:17,605
center of this reference and you know

1405
00:47:17,635 --> 00:47:19,165
like i do impressions and like i

1406
00:47:19,165 --> 00:47:20,215
did a pretty good job and i

1407
00:47:20,215 --> 00:47:22,915
even sang the song which was not

1408
00:47:22,915 --> 00:47:24,895
a requirement issue which i can do

1409
00:47:24,895 --> 00:47:27,535
pretty well still and then i'm finally

1410
00:47:27,565 --> 00:47:29,335
like i was like whatever happened with

1411
00:47:29,335 --> 00:47:30,745
that right and i looked it up

1412
00:47:30,745 --> 00:47:32,755
and it's joseph gordon levitt yeah

1413
00:47:33,955 --> 00:47:36,415
well the audition process was rigorous but

1414
00:47:36,415 --> 00:47:38,305
he made it through he made it

1415
00:47:38,335 --> 00:47:40,435
i count to hear that i had

1416
00:47:40,435 --> 00:47:41,815
an audition too i'm sure will be

1417
00:47:41,815 --> 00:47:43,375
exactly what they asked for i had

1418
00:47:43,375 --> 00:47:45,745
an addition to two for the voice

1419
00:47:45,745 --> 00:47:48,145
of a character the actress had passed

1420
00:47:48,145 --> 00:47:49,885
away who did this character i'm not

1421
00:47:49,885 --> 00:47:51,505
going to talk about what it was

1422
00:47:51,505 --> 00:47:53,785
we've we've talked about go ahead personally

1423
00:47:54,175 --> 00:47:56,455
no show did i say things good

1424
00:47:56,485 --> 00:47:57,805
i know i think we've talked about

1425
00:47:58,015 --> 00:48:00,355
oh i don't personally hand and give

1426
00:48:00,355 --> 00:48:02,455
us those juicy deets here it's better

1427
00:48:02,455 --> 00:48:04,255
than just telling a story again is

1428
00:48:04,255 --> 00:48:05,845
it better than here for five hundred

1429
00:48:05,875 --> 00:48:07,195
oh yeah i don't know i mean

1430
00:48:07,195 --> 00:48:08,695
i anyways it was like an iconic

1431
00:48:08,695 --> 00:48:10,315
character and i really worked hard on

1432
00:48:10,315 --> 00:48:12,685
the on the impression i and i

1433
00:48:12,715 --> 00:48:14,215
think i did a really good job

1434
00:48:14,635 --> 00:48:16,705
and that was doc brown some for

1435
00:48:16,718 --> 00:48:18,295
the person who got it is really

1436
00:48:18,325 --> 00:48:21,265
why is it blindly established voice actor

1437
00:48:21,265 --> 00:48:23,125
and not not like super famous and

1438
00:48:23,125 --> 00:48:24,115
that way but super famous in the

1439
00:48:24,115 --> 00:48:25,945
voice right yeah i was like that

1440
00:48:25,945 --> 00:48:27,835
one makes sense yeah she really really

1441
00:48:27,835 --> 00:48:30,415
really good yes um i was working

1442
00:48:30,415 --> 00:48:31,915
on it really hard but i would

1443
00:48:31,915 --> 00:48:33,625
have been more way more nervous yeah

1444
00:48:33,805 --> 00:48:34,255
two

1445
00:48:34,405 --> 00:48:37,105
achieve that's a very specific thing where

1446
00:48:37,105 --> 00:48:38,185
you say oh yeah of course that

1447
00:48:38,185 --> 00:48:40,015
makes sense yeah that one person does

1448
00:48:40,045 --> 00:48:41,185
that was one where i was like

1449
00:48:41,305 --> 00:48:42,595
okay yeah you know i mean like

1450
00:48:42,595 --> 00:48:44,065
sometimes they just drive you insane though

1451
00:48:44,065 --> 00:48:45,355
when you see what it is and

1452
00:48:45,355 --> 00:48:47,365
it's just like wow why was i

1453
00:48:47,365 --> 00:48:50,035
sending this into the void yes exactly

1454
00:48:50,065 --> 00:48:52,255
yeah exactly sometimes i feel like i

1455
00:48:52,495 --> 00:48:54,025
i don't get hired for stuff because

1456
00:48:54,025 --> 00:48:54,565
i have too many

1457
00:48:54,565 --> 00:48:57,205
he just too many requirements for that

1568
00:52:47,295 --> 00:52:49,875
exactly the director must only instruct the

1569
00:52:49,875 --> 00:52:51,105
star in the way they are saying

1570
00:52:51,105 --> 00:52:51,825

you've been smoking one hundred cigarettes a

1574
00:52:55,875 --> 00:52:58,065
day and slower the star should piece

1575
00:52:58,065 --> 00:53:00,585
together this celebrity's identity and only through

1576
00:53:00,675 --> 00:53:02,985
only through those commands the director cannot

1577
00:53:02,985 --> 00:53:04,635
give hints to their identity and every

1578
00:53:04,635 --> 00:53:05,715
