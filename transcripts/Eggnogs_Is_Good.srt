21
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,850
to do for our last episode was

22
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:13,560

24
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:16,230

that slew a threesome girl

31
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,040
um so we thought it'd be fun

32
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,810
to play every single game we've played

33
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:35,970
on the show for one episode we

34
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,500
thought it would be fun we don't

35
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,510

36
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:41,940

39
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:47,130
how to play these

40
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,980
bring it all back to episode one

41
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,380
it'll be a game to see if

42
00:01:52,410 --> 00:01:54,240
we can remember so yeah so there's

43
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,640
a metagame happening over the entire game

44
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,110
which is do we remember the games

45
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,810

some of these don't have winners but

48
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:07,800
they all have losers yesterday so we

49
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,370
might score

50
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,900
who wins the every show that we

51
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,370

52
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,540
oh that's true you including chevron oh

53
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:19,710

00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:45,900

okay so the first game is ha

106
00:04:18,687 --> 00:04:20,430
i gotta go this is when you

107
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:21,750
brought it yes and we played it

108
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,910
twice two people improvise a boring conversation

109
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:25,530
while the third laughs and make some

110
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:27,570
excuse to leave oh so it's two

111
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:29,700
of us improvising i okay great it's

112
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:31,925
two this is your third chance understand

113
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:33,870
this is the third time july daddy

114
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:35,700
was just two people talking in one

115
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:36,480
leaves it's ok

116
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,760
three talking two of them are being

117
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:41,075
particularly boring okay gotta go but we're

118
00:04:41,075 --> 00:04:42,300
in cooling you want wants to find

119
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,370
a smooth exit okay yes that's that's

120
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:46,170
the that's the key is to have

121
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:48,390
a smooth exit smooth as possible because

122
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:50,010
i'm not going to because any bumps

123
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,300
right well i think the idea was

124
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:54,240
to originally to do it as realistically

125
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,070
as possible like if you were in

126
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:56,640
that situation

127
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:59,220
ation how is how to extract yourself

128
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:02,100
from a boring god conversation okay so

129
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:04,080
without seeming call and i will be

130
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:05,580
middle of conversation leave

131
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,520
um how long have you had those

132
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,980

136
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:19,470
yeah they're a little bit squeaky i

137
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:21,090
mean they look great but they slightly

138
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,320
i don't know if that's gonna be

139
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,580
a thing that goes away or if

140
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:24,900
it's gonna be like they just make

141
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:25,852
noise you know i don't know if

142
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:26,880

144
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,210

i was interested in i do find

162

it strange that he would come to

00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:18,660
the wake and you wouldn't have any

00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:20,640

off my wife's bank account if that

886
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:00,540

890
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:07,440

field in the middle of the night

892
00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:09,780
but i mean eventually we're gonna go

00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:14,460
heart trouble at any moment you choose

00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:16,080
oos you know what doctors are like

897
00:35:16,290 --> 00:35:17,580
once they get their hands on a

898
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:19,650

me off at the hospital they can't

903
00:35:28,530 --> 00:35:30,450
very well keep them from answering letters

904
00:35:30,450 --> 00:35:31,800
can they they wouldn't keep him from

905
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,270
arranging for the money if he wanted

906
00:35:33,270 --> 00:35:33,510
to

907
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:35,790
who are you talking about right now

908
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:37,020
are you talking about horace because i

909
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:38,880
need to get to a hospital has

910
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:39,988
it occurred to you that horse is

911
00:35:39,988 --> 00:35:42,480
also a good businessman i know i

912
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:45,030
agree is but things are getting dire

913
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:46,920
for me my my chest has been

914
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:47,880
but i feel like i'm having a

915
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,620
heart attack for the past two hours

916
00:35:49,830 --> 00:35:50,730
and we've been sitting here in a

917
00:35:50,730 --> 00:35:53,580
field certainly he is a shrewd trader

918
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:54,780
always has been the bank is

919
00:35:54,810 --> 00:35:56,640
proof of that i know the bank

920
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:59,100
probably has proof but ah look if

921
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:00,210
you want to talk about horse i

922
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,710
we can settle this right now as

923
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:03,180
long as you promised to take me

924
00:36:03,330 --> 00:36:06,750
to a hospital afterwards then possibly he

925
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:08,220
may be keeping silent because he doesn't

926
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:09,270
think he is getting enough for his

927
00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:12,240
mummy oh that makes sense i guess

928
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,070
he probably doesn't think he's getting enough

929
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:14,880
for his money what do you

930
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:17,910
talking about nonsense yes it is nintendo's

931
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:19,050
a good thing when he hears it

932
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,610
yes he knows we can make twice

933
00:36:20,610 --> 00:36:22,410
the profit on common goods manufactured here

934
00:36:22,410 --> 00:36:23,790
they can be made in the north

935
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:26,220
look i personally want to make it

936
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:26,940
in the south

937
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:29,340
the north is a little cold for

938
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:31,740
me that isn't what we're doing means

939
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:35,340
rejoin may i interpret you regina regina

940
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:38,190
regina is sad that morris wants more

941
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:39,750
than a third of our share

942
00:36:41,730 --> 00:36:44,160
horace seems shifty to me have you

943
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,570
seen the way his eyes are like

944
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:47,250
really close together but he's only putting

945
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:48,120
up a third of the money you

946
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:48,960
put up a third and you get

947
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,190
a third what else could you expect

948
00:36:50,370 --> 00:36:51,600
i don't know what i expect i

949
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,310
guess i expect horace to be like

950
00:36:53,310 --> 00:36:55,170
more cool about everything well i don't

951
00:36:55,170 --> 00:36:57,120
know i don't know about these things

952
00:36:57,270 --> 00:36:58,140
it would seem that you put up

953
00:36:58,140 --> 00:36:59,310
a third you should get a third

954
00:36:59,310 --> 00:37:00,600
but then again there's no law about

955
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:01,020
it is there

956
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,670
i should think that if you know

957
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:04,020
your money was very badly needed well

958
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:05,340
you just might say i want more

959
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:06,810
i want a bigger share you boys

960
00:37:06,810 --> 00:37:08,370
have done that i've heard you say

961
00:37:08,370 --> 00:37:09,960
so what what does this fucking shark

962
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,370
tank i need to go to a

963
00:37:11,370 --> 00:37:14,550
hospital so you believe he has deliberately

964
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:16,830
held out for a larger share yeah

965
00:37:17,010 --> 00:37:19,140
i do honestly well i don't believe

966
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:21,150
it but i do believe that's what

967
00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:23,070
you want am i right regina

968
00:37:24,990 --> 00:37:27,300
it's rejoined but yeah yeah i do

969
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:28,800
i do want a bigger share than

970
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,900
horace look horace doesn't deserve it i

971
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:32,790
put in all the work oh i

972
00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:34,950
shouldn't like to be too definite but

973
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:36,480
i could say that i wouldn't like

974
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,160
to persuade horace unless he did get

975
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:40,230
a larger share i must look after

976
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:43,920
his interests it seems only natural yeah

977
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:44,460
yeah of

978
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:45,900
of course it's natural it's as natural

979
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:48,450
as boobs and where would the larger

980
00:37:48,450 --> 00:37:49,020
