a job that i can't speak of

276
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,250
and um

278
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:48,810
of interesting because i like have turned

279
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:50,580
down dyeing my hair for jobs multiple

280
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:52,170
times we were playing bozo the clown

281
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:56,370
yeah fuck yourself ah my subtle yeah

282
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:57,930
so yourself

283
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:01,320
i've like i've been asked to color

284
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,760
it multiple times for jobs because a

285
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,280
lot of times their sitcoms stuff will

286
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,080
be as basic as a situation priority

287
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,820
to people who at the santa clara

288
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,470
harris yes yes yeah if you tell

289
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,390
told apart yeah right yeah so they'll

290
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:13,488
be like ah can you get your

291
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,060
docker for this and i'm like no

292
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:16,380
and then they would do someone else's

293
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:17,700
hair like that's happening with them so

294
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:18,630
where

295
00:10:19,507 --> 00:10:20,905
dye their hair because they like already

296
00:10:20,905 --> 00:10:21,985
dyed their hair a lot and i

297
00:10:21,985 --> 00:10:22,765
always got out of it because i

298
00:10:22,765 --> 00:10:24,625
had virgin hair because i never colored

299
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:25,763
my parents and they'd be like ooh

300
00:10:25,763 --> 00:10:28,495
we can't ruin it and so then

301
00:10:28,495 --> 00:10:30,775
this job i had been thinking about

302
00:10:31,285 --> 00:10:33,145
possibly changing the hair color excuse me

303
00:10:33,205 --> 00:10:35,065
huh huh

304
00:10:37,255 --> 00:10:38,335
and so it was kind of in

305
00:10:38,335 --> 00:10:40,105
my mind but it was still something

306
00:10:40,105 --> 00:10:41,635
i probably would have taken months to

307
00:10:41,635 --> 00:10:44,125
even consider doing for real but then

308
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:45,625
they said will you dye your hair

309
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:47,245
red-faced and i was like sure and

310
00:10:47,245 --> 00:10:49,105
then everyone was like so fucking happy

311
00:10:49,105 --> 00:10:51,745
about it and then did you suspicion

312
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:54,355
oh yeah oh they like so much

313
00:10:54,955 --> 00:10:55,765
they it was

314
00:10:55,855 --> 00:10:57,655
the character because the character has red

315
00:10:57,655 --> 00:10:59,815
hair and it's because she's a firebrand

316
00:10:59,845 --> 00:11:02,095
it's supposed to be that way and

317
00:11:02,095 --> 00:11:03,445
so i was willing to go with

318
00:11:03,445 --> 00:11:07,645
it but the second it happened i

319
00:11:07,645 --> 00:11:09,445
got because it was like so it

320
00:11:09,445 --> 00:11:10,915
wasn't like i spent you know a

321
00:11:10,915 --> 00:11:12,685
while looking at pictures and choosing the

322
00:11:12,685 --> 00:11:14,125
exact shade or anything like that it

323
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:15,445
was really just like the chose for

324
00:11:15,445 --> 00:11:15,962
you yeah but

325
00:11:16,015 --> 00:11:17,065
was like kind of weighed in but

326
00:11:17,065 --> 00:11:17,995
then they kinda ignored it like it

327
00:11:17,995 --> 00:11:19,615
was not this ended up not being

328
00:11:19,615 --> 00:11:20,695
the color that i thought it was

329
00:11:20,695 --> 00:11:23,755
gonna be and after it i was

330
00:11:23,755 --> 00:11:24,895
like i'm sorry my thoughts really

331
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:28,195
annoying today but after it happened i

332
00:11:28,195 --> 00:11:29,455
went i was like truly like i

333
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:30,835
couldn't leave this lawn fast enough because

334
00:11:30,835 --> 00:11:32,515
it was like it's hard to like

335
00:11:32,545 --> 00:11:35,035
look at yourself when clearing your throat

336
00:11:36,775 --> 00:11:38,995
sorry for being gary it's hard to

337
00:11:38,995 --> 00:11:41,755
like look at yourself for me to

338
00:11:41,755 --> 00:11:43,015
like look at myself with when there's

339
00:11:43,015 --> 00:11:44,785
been a change if i'm not sure

340
00:11:44,785 --> 00:11:46,525
i like it i don't want anyone

341
00:11:46,525 --> 00:11:48,535
to witness what i'm going through with

342
00:11:48,535 --> 00:11:50,215
my deciding whether i like it or

343
00:11:50,215 --> 00:11:51,115
not but i don't want them to

344
00:11:51,115 --> 00:11:52,945
once you've made the decision you invite

345
00:11:52,945 --> 00:11:54,745
people in yeah but i was like

346
00:11:54,745 --> 00:11:55,555
true like i need to be a

347
00:11:55,555 --> 00:11:56,335
home alone

348
00:11:56,336 --> 00:11:58,255
don't looking at this in the eye

349
00:11:59,005 --> 00:12:00,355
i need to be flopping along my

350
00:12:00,385 --> 00:12:02,515
face yeah i completely understand this and

351
00:12:02,515 --> 00:12:04,855
i think like if if after you

352
00:12:04,855 --> 00:12:07,615
got your hair cut if the person

353
00:12:07,615 --> 00:12:10,015
would walk away and just like give

354
00:12:10,015 --> 00:12:11,125
you the party

355
00:12:12,595 --> 00:12:14,484
so like get a section like a

356
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:16,165
local little bit and be like oh

357
00:12:16,195 --> 00:12:17,575
yeah put your hands through and kind

358
00:12:17,575 --> 00:12:19,255
of think about it yeah because you

359
00:12:19,255 --> 00:12:20,755
feel so much pressure when the ones

360
00:12:20,755 --> 00:12:22,735
that take you to look at it

361
00:12:22,765 --> 00:12:24,385
look at to decide to i mean

362
00:12:24,385 --> 00:12:26,815
like my typical going for me typically

363
00:12:26,815 --> 00:12:28,585
going to the salon it's pretty basic

364
00:12:28,585 --> 00:12:30,565
i do like the same for variations

365
00:12:30,565 --> 00:12:31,582
of a thing over and over again

366
00:12:31,582 --> 00:12:32,323
and i'm like i know if

367
00:12:32,335 --> 00:12:33,295
i like it i know that once

368
00:12:33,295 --> 00:12:34,255
i washed it it'll be different i

369
00:12:34,255 --> 00:12:35,575
know what's gonna happen this was like

370
00:12:35,575 --> 00:12:37,195
so unusual because i've never colored my

371
00:12:37,195 --> 00:12:39,115

00:14:58,495 --> 00:15:00,235
a role much like you ah what

443
00:15:00,235 --> 00:15:01,105

they did it several times was that

448
00:15:09,715 --> 00:15:12,895
i'm at all i do so yeah

449
00:15:12,925 --> 00:15:14,273
if it doesn't look like cut it

450
00:15:14,273 --> 00:15:15,925
too fast i wouldn't say look great

451
00:15:16,135 --> 00:15:18,685
yeah but ah yeah it is easier

452
00:15:18,685 --> 00:15:20,185
with shorter hair because you just like

453
00:15:20,215 --> 00:15:21,175
let it grow a little bit and

454
00:15:21,175 --> 00:15:22,855
yeah yeah and it kind of made

455
00:15:22,855 --> 00:15:24,415
me look too pale i think that

456
00:15:24,569 --> 00:15:25,795
sort of look like a vampire if

457
00:15:25,795 --> 00:15:26,935
i've had my hair black and i

458
00:15:26,935 --> 00:15:27,265
looked

459
00:15:27,295 --> 00:15:30,145
like you like somebody from an indeterminate

460
00:15:30,145 --> 00:15:32,995
country like who this guy is yeah

461
00:15:33,685 --> 00:15:35,425
he looks like he's from somewhere else

462
00:15:35,485 --> 00:15:37,945
yeah but god bless and thank god

463
00:15:37,945 --> 00:15:39,565
blaming him for coming and go back

464
00:15:39,565 --> 00:15:40,285
where you came from

465
00:15:43,165 --> 00:15:44,965
um but yeah i used to for

466
00:15:44,965 --> 00:15:46,165
fun i used to cut my own

467
00:15:46,165 --> 00:15:47,967
hair for a long time yeah yeah

468
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:50,035
and never done anything like that yeah

469
00:15:50,065 --> 00:15:51,055
i think it would be harder when

470
00:15:51,055 --> 00:15:52,165
you have long hair because it's like

471
00:15:52,165 --> 00:15:54,025
there's so many factors of like yeah

472
00:15:54,025 --> 00:15:55,195
it's like you can do mess it

473
00:15:55,195 --> 00:15:57,655
up really yeah and when you're shitty

474
00:15:57,715 --> 00:15:59,455
when you're just cutting short it's just

475
00:15:59,455 --> 00:16:00,775
kind of like you know yeah i'm

476
00:16:00,805 --> 00:16:01,615
not tossing what

477
00:16:01,615 --> 00:16:03,415

480
00:16:08,875 --> 00:16:10,108

481
00:16:10,108 --> 00:16:12,415
and looked appropriate to your face and

482
00:16:12,415 --> 00:16:13,705

in-person here and it was so much

484
00:16:16,645 --> 00:16:19,105
less a dramatic change well because i

486
00:16:21,865 --> 00:16:25,585

557
00:18:27,295 --> 00:18:29,815
wasn't like it was a tight curl

558
00:18:29,815 --> 00:18:31,285
or anything right yeah and then it

559
00:18:31,285 --> 00:18:32,395
was a whole summer so it all

560
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:34,645
just gradually went away right you know

561
00:18:34,705 --> 00:18:36,925
also who cares yeah about the entire

562
00:18:36,925 --> 00:18:38,312
store not you whenever he ever said

563
00:18:38,815 --> 00:18:39,295
you die

564
00:18:39,295 --> 00:18:41,755
higher story okay look at this teabag

565
00:18:42,055 --> 00:18:43,405

it's like an little sashay sashay shot

568
00:18:51,865 --> 00:18:53,305
anyway all i wanna say about it

569
00:18:53,305 --> 00:18:55,465
is um i can't wait don't look

570
00:18:55,885 --> 00:18:57,145
like dumb people in your life just

571
00:18:57,145 --> 00:18:58,945
say you look you look yes but

572
00:18:58,975 --> 00:19:01,075
then there's the here's what happens sometimes

573
00:19:01,135 --> 00:19:03,025
and this happens anytime anyone changes anything

574
00:19:03,025 --> 00:19:04,255
and tell me if you get this

575
00:19:04,285 --> 00:19:07,315
with anything where someone just goes you

576
00:19:07,315 --> 00:19:09,715
changed your hair and then you're like

577
00:19:09,775 --> 00:19:12,505
yeah and then they're like alright yeah

578
00:19:12,535 --> 00:19:14,155
and they don't say you don't know

579
00:19:14,155 --> 00:19:15,865
where the other oh i have had

580
00:19:15,865 --> 00:19:18,565
this multiple times with this red where

581
00:19:18,565 --> 00:19:20,095
someone's like oh you changed your hair

582
00:19:20,095 --> 00:19:22,165
color and then i'm like yeah i

583
00:19:22,165 --> 00:19:23,995
yeah it's maybe thing day they think

584
00:19:23,995 --> 00:19:24,415
that you

585
00:19:24,415 --> 00:19:26,095
you are unsure of how you feel

586
00:19:26,095 --> 00:19:27,235
about it so they don't want offer

587
00:19:27,235 --> 00:19:29,155
an opinion because you're like jumping the

588
00:19:29,155 --> 00:19:30,805
gun going like yeah it's fair thing

589
00:19:30,835 --> 00:19:32,485
you're not going like yeah and it's

590
00:19:32,485 --> 00:19:34,585
fabulous here's why i think it is

591
00:19:34,615 --> 00:19:35,575
i don't know go on here's why

592
00:19:35,575 --> 00:19:36,980
i think it is also depends on

593
00:19:36,989 --> 00:19:38,605
relationship of the person yeah you have

594
00:19:38,605 --> 00:19:40,825
to the acquaintances i would i would

595
00:19:40,855 --> 00:19:43,105
because more quincy i think that they

596
00:19:43,105 --> 00:19:43,615
are

597
00:19:44,635 --> 00:19:46,645
you have from their point of view

598
00:19:46,885 --> 00:19:48,385
like from my point of view would

599
00:19:48,385 --> 00:19:49,405
be the same thing that i hadn't

600
00:19:49,405 --> 00:19:52,225
seen that picture on instagram it's not

601
00:19:52,225 --> 00:19:54,265
that dramatic change it doesn't look that

602
00:19:54,265 --> 00:19:56,005
dramatic no it's not like i'm a

603
00:19:56,005 --> 00:19:58,225
guy who doesn't recognize hair it's weird

604
00:19:58,225 --> 00:20:00,505
because it's taken from him the original

605
00:20:00,535 --> 00:20:03,625
red yes so ratliff that i was

606
00:20:03,655 --> 00:20:04,735
i walked around being like

607
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:06,895
like all great everyone thinks i'm i

608
00:20:06,925 --> 00:20:08,665
think i'm quirky now like it was

609
00:20:08,665 --> 00:20:11,245
like feeling like wow like every you

610
00:20:11,245 --> 00:20:13,375
know i realized all my life i

611
00:20:13,375 --> 00:20:15,925
don't actually don't judge people for coloring

612
00:20:15,955 --> 00:20:17,245
their hair but there was something about

613
00:20:17,245 --> 00:20:18,835
doing myself i was like i guess

614
00:20:18,835 --> 00:20:20,065
i want everyone to look at me

615
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:21,830
like it was like so read if

616
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:23,755
you're gone like blonde no i've never

617
00:20:23,755 --> 00:20:24,895
known she's never colored her

618
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:26,910
and that's why this is like having

619
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:30,900
a real done highlights note but ever

620
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:34,290
show piping natural and highly mortar hat

621
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:37,050

622
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:37,920
my appearance

623
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:41,100

man who is my head up yeah

625
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:46,380

627
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:48,480

you allowed to do this that's what

630
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:52,950
i always would think and then i

631
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:54,000
did it i want do you feel

632
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,030
like you stop who me me i

633
00:20:57,030 --> 00:20:58,380
would like to close the causes you

634
00:20:58,410 --> 00:20:59,520
ever came to doing it of your

635
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,210
own volition

636
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:03,840
um scott that means because you want

637
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,780
to oh thank you i really have

638
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:09,630
never bow what now i've never really

639
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:11,310
come that close to doing it i

640
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:12,960
usually am just like but you've thought

641
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,910
about it idly because my mom has

642
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:15,750
always been a big thing about me

643
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:17,670
not dying my hair because ah she's

644
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:19,770
like oh no young guys do it

645
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:20,910
you'll be on this

646
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:22,440
thing your whole life of having now

647
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,910
you'll never get that back you'll never

648
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:25,140
get that original color like i have

649
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:26,250
a cousin who's like always trying to

650
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:28,110
get my color because she used to

651
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:29,550
have that color right but it's hard

652
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:30,990
to get because it's like natural doesn't

653
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:33,150
just grow out yeah but then like

654
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:34,500
you have roots and so it's like

655
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,750
this kind of constant like dying process

656
00:21:36,810 --> 00:21:38,280
okay your roots grow and then you

657
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:39,810
sew but anyway you're gonna let your

658
00:21:39,810 --> 00:21:41,100
roots close you don't have to

659
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,300
to do that it's gonna say this

660
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:44,220
is gonna fake semi-permanent so it'll just

661
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:46,200
like go away supposedly but i want

662
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,360
to go faster right um but my

663
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:49,590
when i try most dye my hair

664
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:53,010
for this job sean know and then

665
00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:56,880
i was like stop i'm hoping this

666
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,980
is a job i said yes it's

667
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:01,020
championing was trisha to say she was

668
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:01,230
going to

669
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:04,710
thank you um she said nothing of

670
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:06,630
the sort yesterday i couldn't even i

671
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:10,140
couldn't even go along ah um but

672
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:11,751
now are you do you don't you

673
00:22:11,776 --> 00:22:12,510
do you have any of those things

674
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:14,790
like things your parents always said that

675
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:16,560
like then it's hard to change it

676
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:17,670
in your mouth i eventually was like

677
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:20,310
i have to go to hell or

678
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:21,354
i'll just forever be

679
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:22,950
like because i think as an actor

680
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:23,700
i'm like i want to be able

681
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,530
to be versatile and like change it

682
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:27,420
and like i don't want to feel

683
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:29,220
like i have to always look the

684
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:31,181
same yeah no of course i mean

685
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,970
it's a bit like the ingrained and

686
00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:34,950
meets yeah not changed well i got

687
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:36,570
in trouble when i was in joseph

688
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:38,580
and the amazing technicolor dreamcoat for getting

689
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:40,920
a haircut and they were very upset

690
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:41,190
at me

691
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:43,440
gave me a talking to oh wow

692
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:44,970
yeah because it wasn't a cut that

693
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:46,230
was like it just kept it it

694
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:48,720
wasn't bible appropriate but it was a

695
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,010
mohawk i think we did it for

696
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:51,450
six weeks or whatever and i got

697
00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:53,730
a haircut around week three and it

698
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:55,380
was short it was shorter than when

699
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:56,940
we started and they're like you can't

700
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:58,200
do that we you need to clear

701
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,750
any haircut through us you know i'm

702
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:01,710
just like my

703
00:23:01,770 --> 00:23:03,300
hair isn't a huge part of this

704
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,820
yeah just seem interesting for that but

705
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,620
be upset but it was a lesson

706
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:09,150
of just you know you can't i

707
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:10,710
guess it's because part of it's the

708
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:12,120
way you looked when they cast you

709
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,250
yeah cut they they felt that you

710
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:15,720
had a certain look that was part

711
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,430
of the appeal of you for that

712
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:18,660
character i think i was a warm

713
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:19,800
body that happened to go to the

714
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,660
school they just put me through

715
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:23,550
me all excited a sort of arm

716
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:24,510
norm

717
00:23:24,930 --> 00:23:26,190
did your parents have any things like

718
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:27,210
you could never do

719
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,240
it's tough because my

720
00:23:31,290 --> 00:23:32,640
parents were

721
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:35,820
my first of all my dad who

722
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:37,710
knows what he thought about anything but

723
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:40,800
my mom could be very contentious and

724
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,480
so is a lot of rather than

725
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,760
me if she told me something like

726
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,290
that i wouldn't think oh i should

727
00:23:46,290 --> 00:23:47,370
never do this i would think i'm

728
00:23:47,370 --> 00:23:49,440
going to do that for sure oh

729
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,660
yeah but the closest like i remember

730
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:53,790
i came home from um

731
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:55,470
there was a thing called senior week

732
00:23:55,530 --> 00:23:57,930
which was after you graduated high school

733
00:23:58,050 --> 00:24:00,510
after yeah after you graduated high school

734
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:02,220
years ago i am sure i know

735
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:03,720
it's it's weird to me now but

736
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:06,180
we'd all did this it was a

737
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:09,060
week after dread after the graduate high

738
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:12,990
school after graduated i'm just you i'm

739

00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:56,070
yourself you say think this is different

759
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:03,060
this is not ah so this graduation

760
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:05,760

761
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,490
juice and desert rats' scripts in june

762
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,710
and so i think not long after

763
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:12,720
that and i don't know if this

764
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,460
was common to this amendment coming to

765
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:17,220
catholic schools in the area where you

766
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:17,340
were

767
00:25:17,370 --> 00:25:21,240
would rent a place ah the jersey

768
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:23,040
shore either like you'd get a beach

769
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,261
house where you're all together you get

770
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:26,370
like our williams or something it's just

771
00:25:26,370 --> 00:25:28,470
as high schoolers yeah it's also fun

772
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:30,000
yeah why would you not do it

773
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,440
see if you've heard all the details

774
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:33,780
exactly on board because it's a big

775
00:25:33,810 --> 00:25:35,730
it's a weeklong party that sounds great

776
00:25:35,730 --> 00:25:37,290
you know and it official through the

777
00:25:37,290 --> 00:25:37,500
school

778
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:39,210
all or no no no this was

779
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:40,860
just like there's like a weird custom

780
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:42,480
that we all knew about and took

781
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,310
part in like three hours away or

782
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:46,260
something or no not even that long

783
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:47,940
no not like two hour drive maybe

784
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:51,150
something like that and um you would

785
00:25:51,570 --> 00:25:52,830
yeah the idea was a you and

786
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:55,020
your friends would converge on the same

787
00:25:55,050 --> 00:25:56,970
beach area so like we went to

788
00:25:56,970 --> 00:25:57,630
wildwood

789
00:25:57,660 --> 00:26:01,050
new jersey and um there was this

790
00:26:01,050 --> 00:26:02,640
was a place where you knew you

791
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:06,210
could probably um drink under age kids

792
00:26:06,210 --> 00:26:07,740
are having sex you know because they're

793
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:09,390
away from their parents it's your it's

794
00:26:09,390 --> 00:26:11,400
like a weird living as an adult

795
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,690
kind of although i have to say

796
00:26:13,050 --> 00:26:15,060
and maybe this is um the fact

797
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:16,860
that i'm a woman but when i

798
00:26:17,130 --> 00:26:17,820

is like a very fraught thing where

843
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:38,460
she was my best friend and then

844
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:41,310
we started having a physical relationship exciting

845
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:42,510
and then it was very it was

846
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:46,740
so dramatic yeah it was very dramatic

847
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:50,460
but we it was so it was

848
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:53,580
a big deal we went like farther

936
00:30:50,930 --> 00:30:53,240
topic and it was delightful how much

937
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:55,100

938
00:30:55,130 --> 00:30:56,649

rosa now he was like he really

959
00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:41,960
makes sense because he's going to run

960
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:44,270
this country like a business like successful

961
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:46,970
businessman like ah like ah one that

962
00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:48,380
got no votes because he was so

963
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:50,570
in the middle he no he did

964
00:31:50,570 --> 00:31:51,050
he's the mo

965
00:31:51,050 --> 00:31:53,540
most successful independent i think of all

966
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:55,310
times yes a lot of people believe

967
00:31:55,370 --> 00:31:58,760
ah that he he enabled bill clinton

968
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:00,920
to be president because he you split

969
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,510
the vote he was the only he

970
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:04,130
was the only independent who's ever been

971
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:06,140
like allowed into the debate to like

972
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:08,270
the final debates between the two parties

973
00:32:08,390 --> 00:32:10,790
suddenly there's three because yes so popular

974
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,830
and it was because like everyone was

975
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:15,140
like every politician is stupid and this

976
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:17,420
guy's just a real plain speaker and

977
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:19,370
he's speaking wrong yeah it was sort

978
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:20,990
of the pro-trump trump and i got

979
00:32:20,990 --> 00:32:22,400
snookered into it a little bit and

980
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,870
i was like it actually made more

981
00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:25,160
sense with him than it did with

982
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,930
donald trump yeah maybe i don't recall

983
00:32:26,930 --> 00:32:29,420
the data really seemed political right like

984
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:30,920
i mean like or you're dating na

985
00:32:31,130 --> 00:32:31,370
steam

986
00:32:31,370 --> 00:32:33,170
aimed intelligent it was like he wasn't

987
00:32:33,170 --> 00:32:34,581
he was a business menus from outside

988
00:32:34,581 --> 00:32:36,110
of politics but he was using all

989
00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:37,520
of his own money yeah right and

990
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,680
he talked and he talked almost exclusively

991
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,930
about economics and ethics which is all

992
00:32:41,930 --> 00:32:43,940
anybody gives a shit about right and

993
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:45,290
so it made it made sense plus

994
00:32:45,410 --> 00:32:46,940
oil no fillers i don't know anything

1048
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:26,390
he would wander away from the podium

al gore and dan quayle and this

1173
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:11,630

park avenue where we're about to ah

1180
00:39:27,110 --> 00:39:28,730

1184
00:39:36,650 --> 00:39:38,210
want wow

1185
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:40,010
i feel like i heard that kid's

1186
00:39:40,010 --> 00:39:43,640
voice in my head and bill and

1187
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:45,440
where did they hit you they hit

1188
00:39:45,470 --> 00:39:47,030
right they hit us on the side

1189
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:49,220
like where it was ah me and

1190
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:51,380
janet and her boyfriend brandon was in

1191
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:53,540
the front seat um we were all

1192
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:54,440
in a row we were on that

1193
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:56,420
side and i think the impact probably

1194
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:58,820
was mostly wear but like kind of

1195
00:39:58,820 --> 00:39:58,970
bit's

1196
00:39:58,970 --> 00:40:01,610
tween me and janet and it was

1197
00:40:01,610 --> 00:40:02,840
a hard hit and we stopped and

1198
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,700
the traffic was barely moving so i

1199
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:06,560

1200
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:09,350

1201
00:40:09,350 --> 00:40:12,980

corner and was trying to get across

1203
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,690
but it's it's so it was so

1204
00:40:17,690 --> 00:40:19,130

1205
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:21,590

1208
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:26,720

1209
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:28,070

you are late did that thing where

1232
00:41:06,185 --> 00:41:07,925
be you know we just suffered this

1233
00:41:07,925 --> 00:41:10,265
weird trauma where we we kept asking

1234
00:41:10,265 --> 00:41:11,885
each other over and over again yes

1235
00:41:11,885 --> 00:41:13,025
if it was a new thought yeah

you just gotta be a better it's

1237
00:41:14,765 --> 00:41:16,145
so skew there's gotta be a better

1238
00:41:16,145 --> 00:41:18,815
question settling are you okay because everyone's

1239
00:41:18,815 --> 00:41:20,975
first instinct is to say yeah who's

a ring around it which is what

1483
00:49:11,975 --> 00:49:14,045
i was looking up with yeah sign

1484
00:49:15,335 --> 00:49:17,195
oh i went to urgent care because

1485
00:49:17,405 --> 00:49:18,845
everyone's like just go just like but

1486
00:49:18,845 --> 00:49:20,765
it was like sunday at ten pm

1487
00:49:20,765 --> 00:49:21,875
and it couldn't see me until midnight

1488
00:49:21,905 --> 00:49:24,095
as a whole big to-do turns out

1489
00:49:24,095 --> 00:49:25,265
it wasn't that but i was still

1490
00:49:25,265 --> 00:49:26,196
kind of nervous about it but then

1491
00:49:26,196 --> 00:49:27,275
they gave me some claim but they

1492
00:49:27,275 --> 00:49:30,965
did check my bottle time huh but

1493
00:49:30,965 --> 00:49:33,125
i was also like ah in retrospect

1494
00:49:33,125 --> 00:49:34,235
because it like basically went away the

1495
00:49:34,235 --> 00:49:35,405
next day it was truly like

1496
00:49:35,405 --> 00:49:37,205
like wow god i was like it's

1497
00:49:37,205 --> 00:49:39,365
better get it's better yeah but i

1498
00:49:39,365 --> 00:49:41,675
was worried that possibly i was just

1499
00:49:41,795 --> 00:49:43,595
a little stoned and thought that it

1500
00:49:43,595 --> 00:49:46,475
was yeah right around it wasn't really

1501
00:49:46,475 --> 00:49:47,765
there was because your eyes were red

1502
00:49:47,765 --> 00:49:48,395
around because

1503
00:49:49,685 --> 00:49:51,035
do i see myself into a tizzy

1504
00:49:51,035 --> 00:49:53,555
over for twenty yeah because for twenty

1505
00:49:53,735 --> 00:49:55,355
one hundred and twenty have you ever

1506
00:49:55,355 --> 00:49:58,535

1507
00:49:58,535 --> 00:50:00,365

1511
00:50:07,985 --> 00:50:09,485
i was stressed out about a bomb

1512
00:50:09,485 --> 00:50:09,687
so

1513
00:50:09,755 --> 00:50:11,255
feeling i'm stressed out all the time

1514
00:50:11,735 --> 00:50:15,245

1515
00:50:15,305 --> 00:50:18,305
ah red dots on my arm that

00:50:20,975 --> 00:50:22,925
they were bedbug bites and that we

1518
00:50:22,925 --> 00:50:24,875

the sky was formed it was the

1859
01:01:37,710 --> 01:01:39,780
night when everything became the funniest thing

1860
01:01:39,780 --> 01:01:41,130
that's ever been because yeah we were

1861
01:01:41,130 --> 01:01:42,240
at a party or the party

1862
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:45,390

1863
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:49,050
you're at a party and i we

1864
01:01:49,050 --> 01:01:50,490
everyone had to bring a dessert it

1865
01:01:50,490 --> 01:01:53,010
was exert party yeah and everyone had

1866
01:01:53,010 --> 01:01:56,100
matching desserts yes and everyone hadn't matching

1867
01:01:56,100 --> 01:01:58,320
desert we were at a party everybody

1868
01:01:58,320 --> 01:02:01,500
had matching desserts but they're all pies

1869
01:02:01,500 --> 01:02:05,220
and i brought a pie that looked

1870
01:02:05,220 --> 01:02:06,450
a deck like everyone else's

1871
01:02:06,690 --> 01:02:08,400
except that it had

1872
01:02:12,150 --> 01:02:16,290
it had a significantly ah unusual crust

1873
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:18,720
on the top oh and the whipped

1874
01:02:18,750 --> 01:02:22,260
topping was so high some said it

1875
01:02:22,260 --> 01:02:26,430
touched the sky yeah because lauren had

1876
01:02:26,430 --> 01:02:28,650
stolen some helium from the party store

1877
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:29,700
you're getting at see your lie

1878
01:02:29,700 --> 01:02:32,400
life and injected it into the whipped

1879
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:34,920
cream so anytime anyone ate it their

1880
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:36,420
voice would get really high and they

1881
01:02:36,420 --> 01:02:37,050
would say

1882
01:02:38,100 --> 01:02:38,730
a

1883
01:02:40,830 --> 01:02:43,440
yeah so but so everyone said pie

1884
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:45,840
in the sky it became embarrassing because

1885
01:02:45,900 --> 01:02:48,450
because people's voices did not change for

1886
01:02:48,450 --> 01:02:50,910
forty eight hours oh now whenever there's

1887
01:02:50,910 --> 01:02:52,380

1888
01:02:52,380 --> 01:02:53,550
was a pie in the sky yeah

1889
01:02:53,610 --> 01:02:54,930

01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:34,230
trying to have one just happened but

2006
01:06:34,230 --> 01:06:35,070

what it means yes sure we'll tell

2008
01:06:36,540 --> 01:06:37,920
you what i mean so this is

2009
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:39,690
ten years ago we were roommates and

2010
01:06:39,690 --> 01:06:42,120
we won a free helicopter trip

2011
01:06:43,530 --> 01:06:45,810
that's right we stayed up all night

2012
01:06:46,050 --> 01:06:47,760
to win this contest it was a

2013
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:49,890
radio call-in show yeah and i called

2014
01:06:49,890 --> 01:06:51,420
in with the right answer which was

2015
01:06:51,420 --> 01:06:52,920
what radio station are you listening to

2016
01:06:52,980 --> 01:06:54,720
yeah wow i can't believe so many

2017
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:56,790
people didn't get it it didn't understand

2018
01:06:56,910 --> 01:06:58,350
well they didn't look at their radios

2019
01:06:58,380 --> 01:06:59,400
also a lot of the calls were

2020
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:01,440
wrong numbers right that it had no

2021
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:03,030
idea that contest was calling for pizza

2022
01:07:03,456 --> 01:07:06,480
calling for whatever happened ah well they

2023
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:09,180
say congratulations you've won a helicopter ride

2024
01:07:09,240 --> 01:07:11,220
and what we didn't realize was

2025
01:07:13,380 --> 01:07:15,540
it was a twilight zone themed

2026
01:07:17,220 --> 01:07:19,110
contest yeah so it was a twilight

2027
01:07:19,110 --> 01:07:22,020
zone theme contest where they were determining

2028
01:07:22,020 --> 01:07:24,030
who sounded the most like rod serling

2029
01:07:24,030 --> 01:07:25,560
and we didn't know that i mean

2030
01:07:25,560 --> 01:07:27,630
that's i guess the right answer didn't

2031
01:07:27,630 --> 01:07:29,160
really matter was just i sounded the

2032
01:07:29,160 --> 01:07:30,750
most like rod serling he was even

2033
01:07:30,750 --> 01:07:32,670
trying to do that no but continuing

2034
01:07:32,670 --> 01:07:35,520
with the theme the helicopter ride we

2035
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:36,480

she told me that and that's what

2185
01:13:02,970 --> 01:13:04,380
i said i don't understand that je

2186
01:13:04,380 --> 01:13:06,270
suis last let me accept she said

2187
01:13:06,270 --> 01:13:08,790
let me explain it to you so

2188
01:13:08,790 --> 01:13:11,130
eventually continue this can't be the origin

2189
01:13:11,160 --> 01:13:13,620
of notes so she continued and said

2190
01:13:13,620 --> 01:13:15,210
what she actually meant by it but

2191
01:13:15,450 --> 01:13:17,340
i still never made sense and so

2192
01:13:17,340 --> 01:13:18,540
for years and years and years we'd

2193
01:13:18,570 --> 01:13:20,007
quote penguin in a sandstorm because

2194
01:13:20,109 --> 01:13:21,120
that time when i seem to have

2195
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:22,710
lost my mind and was talking random

2196
01:13:23,580 --> 01:13:26,130
so i committed her to a mental

2197
01:13:26,130 --> 01:13:28,380
health facility and now anytime somebody seems

2198
01:13:28,380 --> 01:13:30,060
to not know what's going on or

2199
01:13:30,060 --> 01:13:31,710
they're confused we say it's like a

2200
01:13:31,710 --> 01:13:33,330
penguin in a sandstorm and then that's

2201
01:13:33,330 --> 01:13:35,460
include for me that she's off her

2202
01:13:35,460 --> 01:13:37,380
meds and i need to maybe call

2203
01:13:37,380 --> 01:13:39,150
a pre-doctoral is my safe word and

2204
01:13:39,150 --> 01:13:40,200
i need help yeah

2205
01:13:40,260 --> 01:13:42,630
so signal is a signal that she's

2206
01:13:42,750 --> 01:13:44,220
going a little kooky and she doesn't

2207
01:13:44,220 --> 01:13:45,330
