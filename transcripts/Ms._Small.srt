that is like fun to do and

416
00:14:17,936 --> 00:14:20,165
there is a ball it's not just

417
00:14:20,165 --> 00:14:21,367
for like romcom so you can take

418
00:14:21,367 --> 00:14:22,715
a quirky bite out of it after

419
00:14:22,715 --> 00:14:22,985
you

420
00:14:23,285 --> 00:14:25,355
yeah a little chat what one comes

421
00:14:25,355 --> 00:14:26,519
up when they're laying in a spot

422
00:14:26,519 --> 00:14:28,805
and unlike the gobos i've never been

423
00:14:29,105 --> 00:14:30,755
to but never even never oh my

424
00:14:30,755 --> 00:14:32,915
god never seen this definitely happened a

425
00:14:32,915 --> 00:14:33,785
million times

426
00:14:34,955 --> 00:14:38,015
maybe it'll happen probably and it's stuck

427
00:14:38,015 --> 00:14:39,605
in your head yeah but it's definitely

428
00:14:39,605 --> 00:14:40,625
something that like you would do if

429
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:44,013
you're being funny did we we watched

430
00:14:44,315 --> 00:14:46,685
marry me the romance launch this have

431
00:14:46,685 --> 00:14:48,035

432
00:14:48,035 --> 00:14:50,255
me to what i say oh janey

433
00:14:50,255 --> 00:14:51,755
got me at the right time she

434
00:14:51,755 --> 00:14:53,735
was like this is on tv right

435
00:14:53,735 --> 00:14:54,935
now but if you have access

436
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:56,285
just do it wash your face first

437
00:14:57,365 --> 00:14:58,623
i probably would i want to watch

438
00:14:58,625 --> 00:15:00,305
it how was it i'm still watching

439
00:15:00,305 --> 00:15:01,745
my life i love a class it

440
00:15:01,745 --> 00:15:03,358
was good rom com it is it

441
00:15:03,358 --> 00:15:05,225
is classic in many ways did you

442
00:15:05,225 --> 00:15:08,285
hear as good from kula okay um

443
00:15:08,315 --> 00:15:11,435
it definitely scratches that particular itch i'm

444
00:15:11,435 --> 00:15:13,535
sure i would like it um it's

445
00:15:13,655 --> 00:15:14,795
it's weird there's a lot of weird

446
00:15:14,795 --> 00:15:16,385
stuff about it there's weird music in

447
00:15:16,385 --> 00:15:17,495
it because she

448
00:15:17,525 --> 00:15:20,195
plays a singer i was finding weird

449
00:15:20,195 --> 00:15:22,085
she's famous in him yes oh she's

450
00:15:22,145 --> 00:15:23,495
huge i don't really know what the

451
00:15:23,495 --> 00:15:25,205
whole thing like more famous than jayla

452
00:15:26,105 --> 00:15:28,925
yes that's a reference gallo in the

453
00:15:28,925 --> 00:15:30,455
movies they're like oh she wishes she

454
00:15:30,455 --> 00:15:30,725
was me

455
00:15:32,315 --> 00:15:35,945
i find it strange in rom-coms when

456
00:15:36,065 --> 00:15:39,155
they are ah like you know how

457
00:15:39,245 --> 00:15:40,925
they can only greenlight movies when people

458
00:15:40,925 --> 00:15:43,805
are a certain like star status yeah

459
00:15:43,835 --> 00:15:45,815
and there are there are so few

460
00:15:45,815 --> 00:15:48,185
of them left these days especially younger

461
00:15:48,185 --> 00:15:50,855
people so they they greenlight these rom

462
00:15:50,855 --> 00:15:52,055
coms with people who are in there

463
00:15:52,085 --> 00:15:54,575
fifty s do they acknowledge like oh

464
00:15:54,605 --> 00:15:57,665
well i've had three marriages already right

465
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:59,645
like why oh why is someone single

466
00:15:59,645 --> 00:16:01,235
when they're fifty five years old day

467
00:16:01,295 --> 00:16:03,155
they don't acknowledge age but they do

468
00:16:03,155 --> 00:16:06,695
say they they they do allude they

469
00:16:06,695 --> 00:16:08,585
referred to jails characters having been married

470
00:16:08,735 --> 00:16:10,925
many times okay like she's a famous

471
00:16:10,925 --> 00:16:11,975
person who's had all these

472
00:16:12,275 --> 00:16:14,795
these romances that didn't work out okay

473
00:16:14,825 --> 00:16:16,175
so same time it's had to be

474
00:16:16,175 --> 00:16:18,365
desert yes that that is her story

475
00:16:18,365 --> 00:16:20,495
actually so yeah it's just odd to

476
00:16:20,495 --> 00:16:22,655
me like when they don't when they're

477
00:16:22,655 --> 00:16:25,145
trying to pretend everyone is thirty yeah

478
00:16:25,175 --> 00:16:26,194
you know what i mean and there's

479
00:16:26,194 --> 00:16:29,585
sort of there's sort of this could

480
00:16:29,585 --> 00:16:32,135
be anybody like somebody the character could

481
00:16:32,135 --> 00:16:32,375
be any

482
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:34,925
the age honestly they don't do anything

483
00:16:34,925 --> 00:16:36,875
specific to being at that stage of

484
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:38,787
life and i'm not saying that people

485
00:16:38,795 --> 00:16:41,105
either to get married by thirty five

486
00:16:41,105 --> 00:16:43,115
or whatever i'm just it's just like

487
00:16:43,115 --> 00:16:44,405
you think it would come up in

488
00:16:44,405 --> 00:16:46,355
their conversation even if like ok you're

489
00:16:46,355 --> 00:16:48,545
fifty five why are you not married

490
00:16:48,545 --> 00:16:50,285
why have you never been shown wilson

491
00:16:50,285 --> 00:16:52,535
is i i believe his wife

492
00:16:52,535 --> 00:16:55,085
he died and j lo has been

493
00:16:56,675 --> 00:16:59,255
everyone's thrilled about in the movie grace

494
00:16:59,255 --> 00:17:03,485
we are that hausfeld ah

495
00:17:04,985 --> 00:17:07,235
we think someone pushed it paul don't

496
00:17:07,235 --> 00:17:09,035
talk about our show eden i do

497
00:17:09,035 --> 00:17:10,145
want to talk about it it was

498
00:17:10,145 --> 00:17:11,855
so fun i haven't watched it yet

499
00:17:11,855 --> 00:17:13,475
but you've watched it i watched bits

500
00:17:13,475 --> 00:17:15,095
and pieces so i was just curious

501
00:17:15,155 --> 00:17:16,145
how it looked in if they were

502
00:17:16,145 --> 00:17:18,065
like switching between the cameras align it

503
00:17:18,065 --> 00:17:19,955
looks really good um so we did

504
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:21,725
a show at dynasty typewriter for no

505
00:17:21,755 --> 00:17:23,345
audience and was just live stream so

506
00:17:23,345 --> 00:17:24,695
there's literally just like

507
00:17:24,755 --> 00:17:26,585
little chuckles from the camera people were

508
00:17:26,586 --> 00:17:27,965
you positive before by the way the

509
00:17:27,965 --> 00:17:30,755
last would be ah yeah so we

510
00:17:30,755 --> 00:17:33,335
really shows the big bang theory without

511
00:17:33,335 --> 00:17:34,895
the laughs yeah yeah it was like

512
00:17:34,895 --> 00:17:36,785
ten minutes of silence within yeah it

513
00:17:36,785 --> 00:17:38,645
was tough to judge like what do

514
00:17:38,645 --> 00:17:39,785
you think would get a big big

515
00:17:39,785 --> 00:17:40,955
laugh and what would get a small

516
00:17:41,015 --> 00:17:43,505
because we're improvising yeah right now so

517
00:17:43,505 --> 00:17:44,795
sometimes we weren't on the same page

518
00:17:44,885 --> 00:17:46,085
sometimes you like i thought that would

519
00:17:46,085 --> 00:17:47,795
get you okay before people think that's

520
00:17:47,795 --> 00:17:48,695
what we did we didn't do that

521
00:17:48,815 --> 00:17:50,705
and i was like no one reacted

522
00:17:50,705 --> 00:17:51,785
and when actually it was one of

523
00:17:51,785 --> 00:17:53,945
the weirdest things because i think we've

524
00:17:53,945 --> 00:17:55,565
been doing these shows on on zoom

525
00:17:55,565 --> 00:17:57,185
or whatever for most of the pandemic

526
00:17:57,185 --> 00:17:59,165
where we can see people responding in

527
00:17:59,165 --> 00:18:01,445
the chat yes right yeah like you

528
00:18:01,445 --> 00:18:02,645
know talking or whatever so we know

529
00:18:02,645 --> 00:18:04,625
people are watching and they're there yeah

530
00:18:04,655 --> 00:18:04,835
yeah

531
00:18:05,015 --> 00:18:07,355
right there but that was the power

532
00:18:07,385 --> 00:18:10,265
felt like nobody knew that that happened

533
00:18:10,325 --> 00:18:12,485
yeah like it was the most it

534
00:18:12,485 --> 00:18:14,975
took me back to like my early

535
00:18:14,975 --> 00:18:16,325
days of improv where i'd perform for

536
00:18:16,325 --> 00:18:18,215
literally five people at the playground theater

537
00:18:18,215 --> 00:18:19,505
in chicago or something and be like

538
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:21,275
we that we would only cancel a

539
00:18:21,288 --> 00:18:22,865
show if there were less than two

540
00:18:22,865 --> 00:18:24,275
people so it was like the rules

541
00:18:24,275 --> 00:18:24,935
were leading one

542
00:18:25,205 --> 00:18:26,345
yeah or i think it was two

543
00:18:26,345 --> 00:18:27,905
or less you know but you could

544
00:18:27,935 --> 00:18:29,705
decide and sometimes you'd still do it

545
00:18:29,975 --> 00:18:31,685
and like thinking it felt like that

546
00:18:31,685 --> 00:18:32,945
because it was like it was so

547
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:34,685
pure i really felt like when i

548
00:18:34,805 --> 00:18:37,023
put i got really depressed after whoa

549
00:18:37,023 --> 00:18:38,075
when i got home i have like

550
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:39,995
a major comedown but i think i

551
00:18:39,995 --> 00:18:41,195
meant that i was like really happy

552
00:18:41,195 --> 00:18:43,565
during it oh okay i had a

553
00:18:43,565 --> 00:18:45,245
great choice design of being happy as

554
00:18:45,245 --> 00:18:45,335
well

555
00:18:45,379 --> 00:18:47,315
you're super depressed no i haven't a

556

a video i don't want to wait

785
00:26:30,355 --> 00:26:32,605

for it it's just like no this

789
00:26:38,005 --> 00:26:39,295
is just a natural end of the

790
00:26:39,295 --> 00:26:40,735
video the way that's not a wait

791
00:26:40,735 --> 00:26:42,505
and wait for like should be reserved

792
00:26:42,505 --> 00:26:44,065
for like a six minute video oh

793
00:26:44,155 --> 00:26:45,895
no you think six is the cutoff

794
00:26:46,195 --> 00:26:46,915
because i i

795
00:26:46,915 --> 00:26:49,345
i've awakened to think like a minute

796
00:26:50,035 --> 00:26:51,535
before the thing happening to see it

797
00:26:51,535 --> 00:26:53,005
but then i go well why don't

798
00:26:53,005 --> 00:26:54,025
you just edit the top of the

799
00:26:54,025 --> 00:26:56,365
video no i'm saying like i don't

800
00:26:56,365 --> 00:26:58,045
want to wait at any point i

801
00:26:58,045 --> 00:26:59,515
don't care if it's very long i

802
00:26:59,515 --> 00:27:00,925
don't i take a wait for it

803
00:27:00,925 --> 00:27:04,615
is only for something where it's it's

804
00:27:05,395 --> 00:27:07,075
you're watching the video games on

805
00:27:07,105 --> 00:27:09,355
eventful yes yeah but you gotta you

806
00:27:09,355 --> 00:27:10,525
gotta watch because there's a pay off

807
00:27:10,765 --> 00:27:11,995
but people are using it for a

808
00:27:11,995 --> 00:27:13,825
thing that just happens in a video

809
00:27:14,065 --> 00:27:14,905
it's like that's not a way with

810
00:27:14,965 --> 00:27:16,615
words it's like saying these actions are

811
00:27:16,615 --> 00:27:18,175
leading to this that's the same as

812
00:27:18,175 --> 00:27:19,945
writing a long fucking tweet and then

813
00:27:19,945 --> 00:27:21,715
going that's it that's the tweet and

814
00:27:21,715 --> 00:27:23,485
it's like yeah it is you wrote

815
00:27:23,485 --> 00:27:25,405
a long tweet you hit that only

816
00:27:25,405 --> 00:27:27,235
works if you're saying like viola davis

817
00:27:27,355 --> 00:27:28,735
that's it that's the tweet like you

818
00:27:28,735 --> 00:27:30,355

i'm like yeah that's a long ass

823
00:27:38,395 --> 00:27:39,775
was what we know that's the tweet

00:27:39,775 --> 00:27:41,575
because it is the tweet stop it's

825
00:27:41,575 --> 00:27:43,345
like the rent-free in your head thing

826
00:27:43,705 --> 00:27:45,565
where people started using an incorrectly and

827
00:27:45,595 --> 00:27:47,395

people never said it again yeah

853
00:28:41,755 --> 00:28:43,015
i think i don't want to speak

854
00:28:43,015 --> 00:28:44,725
for him i wouldn't know what if

855
00:28:44,725 --> 00:28:46,345
he comes back from the grave just

856
00:28:46,345 --> 00:28:47,485
to see if people are doing that

857
00:28:47,515 --> 00:28:49,075
i would be happy with that i'd

858
00:28:49,075 --> 00:28:51,835
be happy but wait how okay what

859
00:28:51,835 --> 00:28:56,695
stage what what stage of reanimation would

860
00:28:56,785 --> 00:28:58,615
a departed loved one have to be

861
00:28:58,615 --> 00:29:00,175
in ready to be like i'm glad

862
00:29:00,175 --> 00:29:01,795
this is happening on meeting so

863
00:29:01,825 --> 00:29:03,944
age of decomposition of like are they

864
00:29:03,944 --> 00:29:05,995
a zombie or they had to be

865
00:29:05,995 --> 00:29:08,605
back to exactly like they wow that's

866
00:29:08,605 --> 00:29:10,105
a lot to aria kidding

867
00:29:10,705 --> 00:29:12,325
what would you what would you accept

868
00:29:12,775 --> 00:29:14,725
i wouldn't want to see them if

869
00:29:14,725 --> 00:29:16,975
this this isn't what what is so

870
00:29:16,975 --> 00:29:20,575
weird about modern zombie fiction is that

871
00:29:20,575 --> 00:29:22,975
people are killing zombies immediately and what

872
00:29:22,975 --> 00:29:25,105
would really happen is at least half

873
00:29:25,105 --> 00:29:26,335
the country would be like we can't

874
00:29:26,335 --> 00:29:28,525
kill these zombies because they might let's

875
00:29:28,525 --> 00:29:29,635
try and funny just try to find

876
00:29:29,635 --> 00:29:30,835
a cure first because

877
00:29:30,835 --> 00:29:32,545
cause like you know this is amazing

878
00:29:32,545 --> 00:29:34,795
that especially nice you know what it

879
00:29:34,795 --> 00:29:36,835
means so then that take it back

880
00:29:37,945 --> 00:29:38,995
but then the other half of the

881
00:29:38,995 --> 00:29:40,915
country would be like oh no our

882
00:29:40,915 --> 00:29:43,525
responsibility to everyone else in the countries

883
00:29:43,525 --> 00:29:45,715
too important and let's kill the zombies

884
00:29:45,715 --> 00:29:47,035
ah so this is your home

885
00:29:48,085 --> 00:29:51,205
huh snowflakes what okay what if you're

886
00:29:51,205 --> 00:29:53,155
what if your friend or relative came

887
00:29:53,155 --> 00:29:56,065
back they were exactly like they worked

888
00:29:56,095 --> 00:29:58,855
if they had milky zombie eyes i

889
00:29:58,855 --> 00:30:01,555
could accept that if they were exactly

890
00:30:01,555 --> 00:30:02,335
how they were but i'd be kind

891
00:30:02,335 --> 00:30:04,195
of scared that they were like not

892
00:30:04,225 --> 00:30:05,635
really used and basically they weren't really

893
00:30:05,635 --> 00:30:07,105
them what if they had like a

894
00:30:07,225 --> 00:30:08,035
partially deque

895
00:30:08,035 --> 00:30:10,945
imposed face which but then everything else

896
00:30:10,945 --> 00:30:14,515
was fine the cheekbones both of them

897
00:30:14,845 --> 00:30:17,275
now i'm saying like their faces slightly

898
00:30:17,455 --> 00:30:18,865
rot like it was the forehead it

899
00:30:18,865 --> 00:30:20,755
would be it doesn't smell or anything

900
00:30:20,995 --> 00:30:22,555
it's just like they came back and

901
00:30:22,555 --> 00:30:24,445
that halted the process it would have

902
00:30:24,445 --> 00:30:27,445
to for you to like be cool

903
00:30:27,985 --> 00:30:28,165
when

904
00:30:28,918 --> 00:30:30,705
their whole life or like they can

905
00:30:30,705 --> 00:30:32,865
only hang absolutely no they could do

906
00:30:32,865 --> 00:30:35,025
they die again no

907
00:30:37,485 --> 00:30:38,925
i don't care for anything that seems

908
00:30:38,925 --> 00:30:40,665
to doe think it seems pretty very

909
00:30:40,665 --> 00:30:42,765
good double jeopardy so you would look

910
00:30:42,765 --> 00:30:43,695
at them and it would not look

911
00:30:43,695 --> 00:30:45,555
good but they would start to create

912
00:30:45,555 --> 00:30:47,865
plastic surgery to fix this no yeah

913
00:30:48,195 --> 00:30:50,835
no that's that's that's the sammy oh

914
00:30:50,865 --> 00:30:52,065
well they way they would come up

915
00:30:52,065 --> 00:30:52,875
with this

916
00:30:54,555 --> 00:30:56,205
they can't they will do it

917
00:30:56,235 --> 00:30:58,455
invent hats yeah because so far we

918
00:30:58,455 --> 00:30:59,655
didn't have him yet what does it

919
00:30:59,745 --> 00:31:00,825
show they have like wear a ski

920
00:31:00,825 --> 00:31:03,825
mask yeah that's creepy and then they

921
00:31:03,915 --> 00:31:05,505

00:34:45,435 --> 00:34:47,925
because everyone turned it down including kula

1026
00:34:47,954 --> 00:34:49,545

00:34:49,545 --> 00:34:51,015
hat in pictures so that in the

1028
00:34:51,015 --> 00:34:52,785
picture yeah she wasn't wearing a hat

00:34:53,205 --> 00:34:55,665
yeah no because it's too windy so

1030
00:34:55,665 --> 00:34:56,835
she's like why did i turn down

1031
00:34:56,835 --> 00:34:57,803

1034
00:35:02,745 --> 00:35:04,065
me like palsy

1035
00:35:04,755 --> 00:35:05,865

1037
00:35:07,725 --> 00:35:10,215

00:35:10,215 --> 00:35:11,655
yeah who cares not on the horse

1039
00:35:11,655 --> 00:35:13,155
every day of my life yeah most

1040
00:35:13,155 --> 00:35:15,075
people who are on horses wear helmets

1041
00:35:15,075 --> 00:35:16,875
in their competitions and things yeah that's

1042
00:35:16,875 --> 00:35:19,245
true so i you're certainly doing that

1043
00:35:19,275 --> 00:35:20,685
well and they're offering it which just

1044
00:35:20,685 --> 00:35:21,885
makes it seem like there's a reason

1045
00:35:21,885 --> 00:35:23,505
they're offering as he has like they

1046
00:35:23,505 --> 00:35:24,533

1047
00:35:24,975 --> 00:35:26,205
this is the way they made it

1048
00:35:26,205 --> 00:35:27,945
feel like hey we're we don't give

1049
00:35:27,975 --> 00:35:29,355
a shit not required but they have

1050
00:35:29,355 --> 00:35:30,855
to bring it up yeah you have

1051
00:35:30,855 --> 00:35:32,925

1052
00:35:32,925 --> 00:35:35,145

1056
00:35:43,365 --> 00:35:45,045
pairing people up with horses and they're

1057
00:35:45,045 --> 00:35:46,725
like you know to cool up oh

1058
00:35:46,725 --> 00:35:48,315
you have a really really you have

1059
00:35:48,315 --> 00:35:51,735
a really nice horse um like very

1060
00:35:51,735 --> 00:35:53,955
gentle very you know whatever and everyone

1061
00:35:53,955 --> 00:35:56,025
gets like nice oh real sweetheart you

1062
00:35:56,025 --> 00:35:58,303
know all this kinda old paint and

1063
00:35:58,305 --> 00:35:59,595
he's like old helmet here

1064
00:35:59,665 --> 00:36:01,155
you get to ride the scary one

1065
00:36:02,985 --> 00:36:05,415
we call him tornado it was nacho

1066
00:36:05,415 --> 00:36:06,975
so they go okay you have nacho

1067
00:36:07,635 --> 00:36:09,945
um okay just be careful of nacho

1068
00:36:09,945 --> 00:36:12,135
because he likes to nip at the

1069
00:36:12,135 --> 00:36:14,595
other horses oh wow and he likes

1070
00:36:14,595 --> 00:36:16,005
to be like sort of the alpha

1071
00:36:16,005 --> 00:36:17,265
and he likes to lead and so

1072
00:36:17,265 --> 00:36:19,725
he's a natural friendly source think i

1073
00:36:19,755 --> 00:36:22,095
think that they should ride nacho yeah

1074
00:36:22,155 --> 00:36:22,395
well

1075
00:36:22,395 --> 00:36:23,805
well later i found out that the

1076
00:36:23,805 --> 00:36:27,255
one that our guide was was wearing

1077
00:36:27,296 --> 00:36:29,353
had like bucked three writers out of

1078
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:31,575

he did i did i oh i

1081
00:36:35,175 --> 00:36:36,285

00:36:36,285 --> 00:36:38,835
for variety yeah yeah i don't know

1083
00:36:38,835 --> 00:36:39,795

1084
00:36:39,795 --> 00:36:41,175
ignorance i don't even know the second

1085
00:36:41,175 --> 00:36:42,555

and it's like i get up on

1088
00:36:46,125 --> 00:36:49,665

1105
00:37:15,585 --> 00:37:17,385

1107
00:37:18,947 --> 00:37:20,205

couple went a different way oh okay

1109
00:37:21,855 --> 00:37:22,875
i think he was proposing

1110
00:37:22,905 --> 00:37:24,765
to her because like you had a

1111
00:37:24,765 --> 00:37:27,765
driver and the driver was like they

1112
00:37:27,765 --> 00:37:29,385
had just met or something like that

1113
00:37:29,385 --> 00:37:31,425
and and the drivers like so you're

1114
00:37:31,455 --> 00:37:34,995
going to be when when his girlfriend

1115
00:37:34,995 --> 00:37:36,285
was in the restroom he's like so

1116
00:37:36,285 --> 00:37:39,375
you're gonna be and he's like ah

1117
00:37:39,495 --> 00:37:40,995
oh i just had sex on the

1118
00:37:40,995 --> 00:37:42,915
horse yes you're gonna be having sex

1119
00:37:43,035 --> 00:37:48,315
horse racing aha yes ah well it

1120
00:37:48,315 --> 00:37:50,625

1122
00:37:51,975 --> 00:37:55,335
come back it's just you and ah

1123
00:37:55,695 --> 00:37:57,765
but then we saw no evidence of

1124
00:37:58,245 --> 00:37:59,415
like her showing off her ring or

1125
00:37:59,415 --> 00:38:00,795
whatever so it may have been just

1126
00:38:00,795 --> 00:38:02,805
like the whole day was planned like

1127
00:38:02,805 --> 00:38:03,195
in later

1128
00:38:03,225 --> 00:38:04,725
that night he was gonna do huh

1129
00:38:04,755 --> 00:38:07,635
sure others time so tell the driver

1130
00:38:07,635 --> 00:38:09,825
he could have blown it seriously i

1131
00:38:09,825 --> 00:38:11,175
never trust a driver with a secret

1132
00:38:11,175 --> 00:38:14,265
like that yeah so rivers love to

1133
00:38:14,265 --> 00:38:16,425
talk so anyway it was just the

1134
00:38:16,425 --> 00:38:17,445

thank you

1166
00:39:15,405 --> 00:39:18,105
um so i'm like in my head

1167
00:39:18,105 --> 00:39:19,395
i'm kind of going yeah i mean

1168
00:39:19,395 --> 00:39:20,775
like i could put this as a

1169
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:22,074
special skill on a resume

1170
00:39:23,385 --> 00:39:26,715
updating your casting website leaning forward and

1171
00:39:26,715 --> 00:39:29,385
backward no words but i'm not controlling

1172
00:39:29,865 --> 00:39:31,035

1173
00:39:31,155 --> 00:39:32,265

00:39:32,265 --> 00:39:34,335
away joe was doing what not other

1175
00:39:34,335 --> 00:39:37,725
shit but joe no controls natural so

1176
00:39:37,755 --> 00:39:40,665
as i'm thinking this suddenly nacho goes

1177
00:39:40,665 --> 00:39:43,245
crazy cool and

1178
00:39:44,145 --> 00:39:47,895
like i don't know from my perspective

1179
00:39:47,895 --> 00:39:49,845
it seemed like nachos stumbled and freaked

1180
00:39:49,845 --> 00:39:53,565
out um the the guide's perspective was

1181
00:39:53,565 --> 00:39:55,275
like it looked like he got spooked

1182
00:39:55,755 --> 00:39:58,005
or something not just perspective nachi was

1183
00:39:58,005 --> 00:39:59,355
like ah

1184
00:39:59,985 --> 00:40:03,495
that explains a lot um but but

1185
00:40:03,495 --> 00:40:06,675
nacho basically like bucks and and tries

1186
00:40:06,675 --> 00:40:09,705
to throw me jesus and hey this

1187
00:40:09,705 --> 00:40:12,525
is terrified i hate this and i

1188
00:40:12,555 --> 00:40:13,935
love it well i love that happened

1189
00:40:13,935 --> 00:40:16,695
to him it's scary but yeah and

1190
00:40:16,785 --> 00:40:19,485
i don't know how but i hold

1191
00:40:19,545 --> 00:40:21,255
on like that he stops when we

1192
00:40:21,255 --> 00:40:23,325
missed yeah it's like he's not listening

1193
00:40:23,325 --> 00:40:24,495
but he's giving room for us to

1194
00:40:24,495 --> 00:40:26,505
do it he's pretend he's like pretending

1195
00:40:26,625 --> 00:40:29,625
like it's too long for a dramatic

1196
00:40:29,625 --> 00:40:29,895
pause

1197
00:40:31,792 --> 00:40:35,435

1198
00:40:35,435 --> 00:40:36,965
don't know how but i hold on

1199
00:40:37,235 --> 00:40:39,245
the the saddle gets like swung to

1200
00:40:39,245 --> 00:40:41,735

i was pretty

1340
00:45:23,975 --> 00:45:25,385
surprised so it kind of went against

1341
00:45:25,385 --> 00:45:27,485
everything i ever thought wow i really

1342
00:45:27,485 --> 00:45:28,565

1344
00:45:29,705 --> 00:45:31,535
want to be a baby i feel

1345
00:45:31,535 --> 00:45:33,185
like i've tried to stop doing that

1346
00:45:33,185 --> 00:45:36,215
in my life yeah oh usually anything

1347
00:45:36,275 --> 00:45:36,605
yeah

1348
00:45:37,655 --> 00:45:39,665
um but i can have my opinion

1349
00:45:39,665 --> 00:45:40,925
on it but i'll use it i'm

1350
00:45:40,925 --> 00:45:43,205
usually but i'm usually like i'll try

1351
00:45:43,205 --> 00:45:45,425
anything that's got me totally to get

1352
00:45:45,425 --> 00:45:47,135
to that point yeah yes it took

1353
00:45:47,135 --> 00:45:48,155
me way too long i think but

1354
00:45:48,155 --> 00:45:50,075
i i definitely do that now but

1355
00:45:50,375 --> 00:45:51,515
i really liked it so maybe i

1356
00:45:51,515 --> 00:45:54,328
do like matcha fuck know they might

1357
00:45:54,328 --> 00:45:56,105

1359
00:45:57,515 --> 00:45:57,785
can

1360
00:45:57,785 --> 00:45:59,675
end up with a bad combination where

1361
00:45:59,675 --> 00:46:01,025
like macho shouldn't be in the thing

1362
00:46:01,025 --> 00:46:03,155
that your symmetric twitches are okay aren't

1363

drop paul was like paul had a

1494
00:50:21,395 --> 00:50:25,295
big idea of us playing julian's the

1495
00:50:25,325 --> 00:50:27,695
the assad brothers i guess

1496
00:50:29,255 --> 00:50:31,985
and i didn't i didn't not know

1497
00:50:32,135 --> 00:50:33,305
at the time i did not know

1498
00:50:33,305 --> 00:50:35,225
about the link between like video game

1499
00:50:35,225 --> 00:50:39,365
people and julian assange type people as

1500
00:50:39,665 --> 00:50:40,805
so i didn't i was just like

1501
00:50:40,835 --> 00:50:42,485
oh that's funny because wikileaks is in

1502
00:50:42,485 --> 00:50:43,805
the news sure okay so we got

1503
00:50:43,805 --> 00:50:47,495

1504
00:50:47,495 --> 00:50:48,605
t-shirts right

1505
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:51,480
and be the the assange brothers because

1506
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:53,760
it was video games or whatever so

1507
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:55,590
paul dropped had to drop out like

1508
00:50:56,010 --> 00:50:57,840
the day before or something like that

1509
00:50:57,840 --> 00:51:00,120
and so he's like but i still

1510
00:51:00,150 --> 00:51:01,770
i bought the wigs and the t-shirt

1511
00:51:01,770 --> 00:51:02,880
so you can still have that i

1512
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:04,740
was like okay trying to wrap my

1513
00:51:04,740 --> 00:51:07,091
mind around like i'm gonna be this

1514
00:51:07,091 --> 00:51:08,520
this that's not even my idea but

1515
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:09,510
i was like ok i'll stick to

1516
00:51:09,510 --> 00:51:09,660
it

1517
00:51:10,230 --> 00:51:12,300
and then so i got one i

1518
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:14,190
don't know why yeah looking back it

1519
00:51:14,190 --> 00:51:15,420
doesn't make sense it doesn't make any

1520
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:17,520
sense but he was like happening game

1521
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:19,110
was time was of the essence is

1522
00:51:19,110 --> 00:51:20,490
all set up a name and a

1523
00:51:20,490 --> 00:51:23,070
t-shirt i'm good to go but i

1524
00:51:23,070 --> 00:51:24,960
was like wendy poops or something yeah

1525
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:25,980
you were winning piece because i was

1526
00:51:25,980 --> 00:51:26,940
like lawrence you want to do this

1527
00:51:26,940 --> 00:51:28,320
i was like this is the idea

1528
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:29,820
where the assange twins

1529
00:51:29,850 --> 00:51:31,049
or something like i don't want to

1530
00:51:31,049 --> 00:51:32,100
do that because it was like i

1531
00:51:32,100 --> 00:51:33,810
don't know anything about that yeah yeah

1532
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:35,850
yeah so so i was which is

1533
00:51:35,850 --> 00:51:37,680
what i should have done too but

1534
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:39,150
i also did beep bebo

1535
00:51:41,370 --> 00:51:43,950
with the peeps brotherton said yeah so

1536
00:51:43,950 --> 00:51:45,570
anyway so so it gets set up

1537
00:51:45,570 --> 00:51:47,580
and i'm i'm like making cracks about

1538
00:51:47,610 --> 00:51:49,620
ah ah what was the other thing

1539
00:51:49,620 --> 00:51:52,590
i was doing i was doing like

1540
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:54,060
stuff that i thought sandra se but

1541
00:51:54,060 --> 00:51:57,780
it was like hashtagging ah oh gamergate

1542
00:51:57,810 --> 00:52:00,270
that's what it was and because because

1543
00:52:00,270 --> 00:52:00,540
in my

1544
00:52:00,540 --> 00:52:02,940
my mind was like look gamergate is

1545
00:52:02,940 --> 00:52:06,390
stupid and anyone who's like obviously these

1546
00:52:06,390 --> 00:52:07,830
people who are watching this show and

1547
00:52:07,830 --> 00:52:09,930
ethics in gaming germany yeah but i

1548
00:52:09,930 --> 00:52:11,520
was like anyone watching the show agrees

1549
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:15,480
with me right yeah so ah i

1550
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:18,390
found out that video game people are

1551
00:52:18,420 --> 00:52:20,610
terrible and they were really mean

1552
00:52:20,730 --> 00:52:24,240
and they they they just were like

1553
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:27,120
sending us the worst like kill yourself

1554
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:31,200
messages and alison twitter al finished his

1555
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:32,850
show and i felt so bad for

1556
00:52:32,850 --> 00:52:34,350
him because we were tracking in real-time

1557
00:52:34,350 --> 00:52:36,000
because we were doing like three minutes

1558
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,650
here five minutes there and we would

1559
00:52:37,650 --> 00:52:39,510
have like euro five their five ten

1560
00:52:39,510 --> 00:52:40,860
minutes off and

1561
00:52:41,070 --> 00:52:42,360
and we were tracking real-time and i

1562
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:43,800
was like lauren you may not want

1563
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:46,020
to look at your twitter because we're

1564
00:52:46,020 --> 00:52:48,300
getting like really mean stuff like let

1565
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:49,830
me guess they put your twitter handles

00:53:21,330 --> 00:53:23,130
fats and how well

1583
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:26,730
it was a time that was yeah

1584
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:28,380
it was it was like i that

1585
00:53:28,380 --> 00:53:30,990
was where i started like figuring out

1586
00:53:30,990 --> 00:53:33,600
that your video game culture could have

1587
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:35,850
no relation to each other video game

1588
00:53:35,850 --> 00:53:38,040
coaches just like the card is so

1589
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:40,830
straight but that video game people have

1590
00:53:40,830 --> 00:53:43,290
a very specific mindset that is not

1591
00:53:43,290 --> 00:53:44,460
that does not necessarily

1592
00:53:44,460 --> 00:53:47,130
align with my oh yeah exactly exactly

1593
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:49,110
oh my god anyway so you went

1594
00:53:49,110 --> 00:53:50,509
to vegas went to vegas we did

1595
00:53:50,509 --> 00:53:53,220
this show for the people of visa

1596
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:55,470
and people in the town of views

1597
00:53:55,470 --> 00:53:58,620
it's really fun and um and then

1598
00:53:58,620 --> 00:54:00,750
afterwards i think somebody from the company

1599
00:54:00,750 --> 00:54:02,130
took us out to dinner oh no

1600
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:03,660
um so we went to like this

1601
00:54:03,660 --> 00:54:04,252
fancy

1602
00:54:04,620 --> 00:54:07,620
around their discovery i'm sure they did

1603
00:54:07,620 --> 00:54:09,330
not sort of scandal but i'm trying

1604
00:54:09,330 --> 00:54:10,371
to think of what the restaurants call

1605
00:54:10,371 --> 00:54:11,820
because i knew what it was but

1606
00:54:11,820 --> 00:54:13,410
i don't remember now it was years

1607
00:54:13,410 --> 00:54:14,880
ago anyways but it was one of

1608
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:16,200
those places where everything was kind of

1609
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:17,580
weird like all of the stuff on

1610
00:54:17,580 --> 00:54:19,380
the menu was like cutting it was

1611
00:54:19,380 --> 00:54:21,750
like it was like ducking cotton candy

1612
00:54:21,750 --> 00:54:23,220
or you like some fucking weird

1613
00:54:24,780 --> 00:54:26,550
hey but we ate by ate everything

1614
00:54:26,550 --> 00:54:27,360
we all did and were all like

1615
00:54:27,365 --> 00:54:29,370
yes it was like fancy and crazy

1616
00:54:29,370 --> 00:54:32,070
and everything was weird and i think

1617
00:54:32,070 --> 00:54:33,480
i can say this that and that

1618
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:34,770
night we all had the worst diarrhea

1619
00:54:34,860 --> 00:54:36,930
ah

1620
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:41,610
i think i can reveal that night

1621
00:54:41,670 --> 00:54:43,590
we adore diary over i i'm allowed

1622
00:54:43,590 --> 00:54:45,000
to reveal this now i was the

1623
00:54:45,030 --> 00:54:46,260
so i was up all night and

1624
00:54:46,260 --> 00:54:47,340
it was the worst then we got

1625
00:54:47,340 --> 00:54:49,170
to the airport where like oh fuck

1626
00:54:49,170 --> 00:54:50,760
were you think it was one it

1627
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:52,320
must have been one ingredient or something

1628
00:54:52,350 --> 00:54:54,240
maybe or it was just how how

1629
00:54:54,420 --> 00:54:56,430
retail rich everything was because we have

1630
00:54:56,430 --> 00:54:58,140
so many things that were ah

1631
00:54:58,170 --> 00:55:01,260
odd and like really just yeah i

1632
00:55:01,260 --> 00:55:02,220
think i don't know that kind of

1633
00:55:02,250 --> 00:55:03,270
so you're saying because like i've never

1634
00:55:03,270 --> 00:55:04,680
seen you before my talk was like

1635
00:55:04,710 --> 00:55:07,440
duck and cat and cotton candy bitch

1636
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:10,860
i'm gonna shit this ah um but

1637
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:13,950
yeah it was pretty funny later anyway

1638
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:15,420
we should go we should we should

1639
00:55:15,420 --> 00:55:17,310
tragedy plus time we should go to

1640
00:55:17,460 --> 00:55:18,300
like a weird dinner

1641
00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:21,450

lot of sense i'd just saw on

1682
00:56:45,030 --> 00:56:45,570

are ulta

1692
00:57:06,780 --> 00:57:08,670
lately my favorites to watch yes but

1693
00:57:08,670 --> 00:57:09,840
it was like it was more of

1694
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:11,850
a personality show than real estate yeah

1695
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:13,740
that's true but i don't mind that

1696
00:57:13,770 --> 00:57:16,320
but my favorite josh is probably joshua

1697
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:18,780
from the bible well yes thank you

1698
00:57:18,810 --> 00:57:20,130

battle of jericho always bringing it back

1700
00:57:21,810 --> 00:57:22,800
down to where we need to be

1701
00:57:23,730 --> 00:57:25,620
this isn't christian podcast we we need

1702
00:57:25,620 --> 00:57:26,940
to make this is so

1703
00:57:26,940 --> 00:57:28,590
someone's first we should have been saying

1704
00:57:28,590 --> 00:57:30,660
that at the top the whole time

1705
00:57:30,750 --> 00:57:32,462

1706
00:57:32,490 --> 00:57:33,810
before now but yeah this is a

1707
00:57:33,810 --> 00:57:35,430
christian podcast yeah and we believe in

1761
00:59:37,290 --> 00:59:39,960

1762
00:59:41,010 --> 00:59:43,230
this three chair is called cursory rhyme

1763
00:59:44,010 --> 00:59:45,510
and it's not what you're thinking actually

1764
00:59:45,510 --> 00:59:46,710
i don't know what it is um

1765
00:59:46,710 --> 00:59:47,760
i don't know what you're saying i

1766
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:50,070
wouldn't presume to tell people when you

1767
00:59:50,070 --> 00:59:51,210
hear the tell me you hear the

1768
00:59:51,210 --> 00:59:53,700
word curse and you don't think immediately

1769
00:59:53,730 --> 00:59:55,380
oh i know what this is just

1770
00:59:55,380 --> 00:59:55,980
a fart

1771
00:59:56,010 --> 00:59:57,900
so bad yeah you are such a

1772
00:59:57,900 --> 01:00:00,900
curse word so this was submitted by

1773
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:03,270
full pet i think it's how you

1774
01:00:03,270 --> 01:00:04,440
say the name but i probably said

1775
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:06,660
it wrong and here's how it got

1776
01:00:06,660 --> 01:00:09,690
spell it p h u l space

1777
01:00:10,080 --> 01:00:12,750
p a t t could be petty

1778
01:00:12,930 --> 01:00:13,800
we don't know if it'd be but

1779
01:00:13,950 --> 01:00:15,750
politics but there's no accent or accent

1780
01:00:15,750 --> 01:00:16,140
agu

1781
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:19,050
okay so one person picks a word

1782
01:00:19,140 --> 01:00:21,150
the person to their right recites the

1783
01:00:21,150 --> 01:00:23,490
first line of a poem which must

1784
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:25,800
end with this word the next person

1785
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:27,720
we're staying home or now because i

1786
01:00:27,720 --> 01:00:29,490
don't think the next person recites the

1787
01:00:29,490 --> 01:00:30,960
second line of the poem ending in

1788
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:32,400
a word rhyming with the first word

1789
01:00:32,430 --> 01:00:34,230
o the first person now adds the

1790
01:00:34,230 --> 01:00:36,300
third line ending with another rhyming

1791
01:00:36,338 --> 01:00:38,460
words continues and different everyone is out

1792
01:00:38,460 --> 01:00:39,988
of writing oh i see notes so

1793
01:00:39,988 --> 01:00:41,190
we're gonna pick a word and then

1794
01:00:41,190 --> 01:00:42,690
we're gonna make a poem every single

1795
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:45,990
line is gonna right yeah okay god

1796
01:00:46,050 --> 01:00:47,550
why is it called cursory i wonder

1797
01:00:47,550 --> 01:00:48,480
because you have to

1798
01:00:50,220 --> 01:00:52,650
cursory rhyme you have to rhyme you

1799
01:00:52,650 --> 01:00:54,630
must it's cursory i don't think that's

1800
01:00:54,630 --> 01:00:56,310
what cursory means can we google it

1801
01:00:56,430 --> 01:01:00,330
let's google ads i thought cursory meant

1802
01:01:00,330 --> 01:01:04,140
like casual like a cursory yeah like

1803
01:01:04,140 --> 01:01:05,802
like i have a i have a

1804
01:01:06,210 --> 01:01:09,180
facile knowledge of this oh it's actually

1805
01:01:09,180 --> 01:01:09,660
the opposite

1806
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:12,800
hasty and therefore not thorough or detailed

1807
01:01:12,830 --> 01:01:16,550
nice great but also says perfunctory yeah

1808
01:01:16,610 --> 01:01:18,440
but perfunctory to me feels like you

1809
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:21,800
have to propose no look wow i

1810
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:22,910
know what you mean i know she

1811
01:01:22,910 --> 01:01:25,130
was a minimum effort of or reflection

1812
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:26,450
like you have like you have to

1813
01:01:26,450 --> 01:01:27,320
do it but you're gonna do with

1814
01:01:27,320 --> 01:01:29,300
a lead me about perfunctory things like

1815
01:01:29,330 --> 01:01:30,410
i'm making it the wrong way

1816
01:01:30,410 --> 01:01:32,750
okay yeah great and then someone said

1817
01:01:32,750 --> 01:01:35,720
is cursory look at my dogs i

1818
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:38,960
behold they're running okay they love to

1819
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:41,030
be away from this house again me

1820
01:01:41,060 --> 01:01:43,820
daddy okay so really i would say

1821
