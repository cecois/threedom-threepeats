87
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:14,944

00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,680
yeah that's cool please don't tell them

92
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:28,140
gotcha but mind

93
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,810
yeah but you didn't want anybody one

94
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:32,760
of those tools right well my day

95
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:33,750
charge an arm and a leg for

96
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,070
those things and i have a record

97
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:35,940
direction

98
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:38,912
um what the fuck but anyway so

99
00:03:38,912 --> 00:03:41,400
the fish came in without the invisible

100
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:43,590
i think it's fucked up is i

101
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:45,990
think there is an agreement with iphone

102
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:47,196
that if you send something which is

103
00:03:47,196 --> 00:03:49,590
invisible to me assure us but it's

104
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:51,240
in this the terms of service that

105
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,980
if you send something with invisible ink

106
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,530
you ye shall receive it with invisible

107
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:57,120
ink but you know it's tough because

108
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,700
because typically invisible ink i feel is

109
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:02,280
only used for bits and games you

110
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,920
know people aren't typically putting like top

111
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,240
secret info in the mage you don't

112
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,160
think that the c i a is

113
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,980
using invisible subjects if they're not stupid

114
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:13,110
they might be but my point is

115
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:14,640
you know they wouldn't put fireworks at

116
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,540
the top of your screen if a

117
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:17,160
firework text came in so i guess

118
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:17,250
it

119
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,750
makes sense that they're not gonna put

120
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,698
the word and it might even upscale

121
00:04:20,698 --> 00:04:23,310
works when the firework texts come oh

122
00:04:23,498 --> 00:04:25,260
yeah and we sent wu like i

123
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:28,080
was like oh my god who's ever

124
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,900
say you who's texting no i'm i'm

125
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,850
saying who's texting about fire about fire

126
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:35,700
yeah how when you say happy birthday

127
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:37,800
to somehow fireworks ten fatty or blue

128
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:39,090
confetti and balloons and all that i

129
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:40,620
thought you meant when someone's like texting

130
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:42,330
hey look at the fireworks and fireworks

131
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,760

balloons congratulations gets confetti or there are

133
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:50,700
other ones that are triggered automatically by

134
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,830
phase probably have the most like secret

135
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:54,210

i'm like well when i have my

188
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:36,517
score be realistic yeah what would i

189
00:06:36,626 --> 00:06:38,130
probably put where would i have gone

190
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:39,570
from there how would i have gotten

191
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:40,650
that sounds like wichita

192
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:43,410
but now janey i think all things

193
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:44,970
a waste of time to be on

194
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:49,320
yeah cheney tomkins janie haddad tompkins yes

195
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:51,750
janie had that dump dans janie had

196
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:54,120
a thompson she even though she hadn't

197
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,500
played yet she wanted to cheat so

198
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,600
she had an invisible inked it and

199
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,130
then this is how i find out

200
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:00,660
she does not listen to the show

201
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:01,650
she says what is this

202
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,720
mean ah la you she didn't didn't

203
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,570
find out by guessing yeah and she

204
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:08,580
said she replied that she's a fan

205
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:10,470
of threesome in real life yeah yeah

206
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:12,780

210
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:21,060
because you're editing every episode i was

211
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:21,840

00:07:22,155 --> 00:07:23,640

00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,190
in other languages they have fun i

271
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:38,610

272
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:41,250
they might i don't know do you

273
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:44,010

00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:46,770
why would they ever do would play

275
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:49,950
why would they third languages are better

276
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:52,140
let's face it english is a mess

277
00:09:52,229 --> 00:09:54,540
is it's it's kind of i mean

278
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:56,610
they they don't call english a romance

279
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:57,660
language for just five

280
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:00,780
i don't think they could ever yeah

281
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:02,700
but i mean it's like there's bias

282
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,950
in calling you know italian and spanish

283
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:07,260
romance languages don't you think well no

284
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:13,110

291
00:10:33,865 --> 00:10:34,950
will afford where you have to buy

292
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:36,420

608
00:21:32,655 --> 00:21:34,395
saying that every single time

609
00:21:34,395 --> 00:21:36,465
in this case like shit said oh

610
00:21:37,965 --> 00:21:39,765
it's not even planned it's just what

611
00:21:39,765 --> 00:21:42,105

00:21:42,105 --> 00:21:42,315
no

613
00:21:43,545 --> 00:21:45,135
so they assign ah an amount of

614
00:21:45,135 --> 00:21:46,695
money to each dish like five thousand

615
00:21:46,695 --> 00:21:48,255
dollars and then or two dollars and

616
00:21:48,255 --> 00:21:50,205
then he tastes it all day he

617
00:21:50,205 --> 00:21:51,495
gives it a pass or he gives

618
00:21:51,495 --> 00:21:52,875
it a thumbs down and if he

619
00:21:52,995 --> 00:21:54,615
if it gets a thumbs down ask

620
00:21:54,615 --> 00:21:57,165
themselves just the rat has the right

621
00:21:57,165 --> 00:21:58,725

622
00:21:58,725 --> 00:22:00,795

625
00:22:03,705 --> 00:22:06,015
saying a real rat yeah huh but

626
00:22:06,015 --> 00:22:07,335
anyway so he was he was on

627
00:22:07,335 --> 00:22:08,715
the show earlier in the season and

628
00:22:08,715 --> 00:22:10,785
he was the rat and he was

629
00:22:11,055 --> 00:22:13,905
ooh and he won like i think

630
00:22:13,905 --> 00:22:15,135
it was twenty five thousand dollars like

631
00:22:15,205 --> 00:22:16,785
he got the money and then no

632
00:22:16,785 --> 00:22:18,165
one gets to his him so these

633
00:22:18,165 --> 00:22:20,775
are professional chefs know i mean some

634
00:22:20,775 --> 00:22:22,065

00:23:33,525 --> 00:23:35,355
do like his his thing was he

671
00:23:35,355 --> 00:23:37,005

by everyone's ovens and turn it up

673
00:23:38,415 --> 00:23:38,475

high as they would go as he

675
00:23:40,395 --> 00:23:42,765
was like passing by that's a good

676
00:23:42,772 --> 00:23:43,005
one

677
00:23:44,235 --> 00:23:45,585
and what i would like blaze up

678
00:23:45,585 --> 00:23:46,725

679
00:23:46,725 --> 00:23:49,187
up in overcook everything oh ma and

680
00:23:49,245 --> 00:23:50,685
some fun that's for sure like some

681
00:23:50,685 --> 00:23:52,365
of the rats would just like walk

682
00:23:52,365 --> 00:23:54,165
by with seasoning in their hands and

683
00:23:54,165 --> 00:23:56,977
just like like to drop and oversaw

684
00:23:57,056 --> 00:23:59,205
everything crop just like that yeah crop

685
00:23:59,205 --> 00:24:00,615
dusted but you can't do it to

686
00:24:00,705 --> 00:24:02,865
everybody right because then obviously if you're

687
00:24:02,865 --> 00:24:03,915
the only one who has good

688
00:24:03,915 --> 00:24:05,235
good dish and it's like hey i

689
00:24:05,235 --> 00:24:07,455
think he's the well weirdly enough already

690
00:24:07,545 --> 00:24:09,945
saying wow you're steven do it to

691
00:24:09,945 --> 00:24:11,505
his own dish did it to everyone

692
00:24:11,505 --> 00:24:14,985
else's dish sorry because say okay and

693
00:24:14,985 --> 00:24:17,025
that guy that threw everyone off his

694
00:24:17,025 --> 00:24:19,035
scent because they were like oh he's

695
00:24:19,035 --> 00:24:20,715
doing good so he's not the rad

696
00:24:20,715 --> 00:24:23,775
he's like he's making good dishes i

697
00:24:23,775 --> 00:24:24,075
don't see

698
00:24:24,075 --> 00:24:25,965
see how that makes any sense yeah

699
00:24:26,055 --> 00:24:27,885
because the rat if they're working on

700
00:24:27,885 --> 00:24:29,355
their own dishes and spoiling it that's

701
00:24:29,355 --> 00:24:31,965
what everyone was thinking of like oh

702
00:24:31,965 --> 00:24:34,035
the rat it was sabotage their own

703
00:24:34,035 --> 00:24:36,705
dish but nobody else's yeah but it

704
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:38,295
doesn't make any sense to me now

705
00:24:38,295 --> 00:24:39,255
i know it doesn't make any sense

706
00:24:39,255 --> 00:24:40,515
to me either it's i just feel

707
00:24:40,515 --> 00:24:41,985
like you'd have to leave one tiny

708
00:24:41,985 --> 00:24:44,025
branch oh yeah oh yeah yes

709
00:24:44,265 --> 00:24:47,565
one other person anyway fighting or just

710
00:24:47,565 --> 00:24:48,735
do a little salt in one of

711
00:24:48,735 --> 00:24:50,595
them doesn't really change it well they

712
00:24:50,595 --> 00:24:52,425
do they actually they do rotate on

713
00:24:52,425 --> 00:24:53,985
most of the dishes were like everyone

714
00:24:54,375 --> 00:24:55,815
gets a chance at working on each

715
00:24:55,815 --> 00:24:57,975
dish so oh so it could be

716
00:24:58,005 --> 00:25:00,525
many people because yes exactly so i

717
00:25:00,645 --> 00:25:02,295

00:25:02,295 --> 00:25:04,125

up their friends' tina fey and steve

1078
00:38:14,949 --> 00:38:16,426

1079
00:38:16,430 --> 00:38:17,210
or a picture of them this is

1080
00:38:17,210 --> 00:38:19,040
all we could find once or twice

1081
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,330
i think i said have you seen

1082
00:38:20,330 --> 00:38:20,900
this movie

1083
00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:22,280
they're like yeah we saw in the

1084
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,690
theaters and that's as far as i

1085
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:24,800
know they just like it that's as

1086
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:25,970
far as you would go because i'd

1087
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:27,590
be asking that a lot more questions

1088
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:29,120
yeah well i didn't want to intrude

1089
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:32,748
sure well so and i believe i'd

1090
00:38:32,748 --> 00:38:34,430
talked about this probably on another show

1091
00:38:34,430 --> 00:38:36,200
scott hasn't seen where we date night

1092
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,010

1093
00:38:37,010 --> 00:38:38,240
like i have no idea why they

1094
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,950
used to but and and it's doesn't

1095
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:41,120
seem to be an important movie to

1096
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:41,450
them you're

1097
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:42,920
thinking about this story is that date

1098
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,690

1099
00:38:45,170 --> 00:38:46,760
yeah like i let anything goes hey

1100
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:48,350
steve carell have talked about that since

1101
00:38:48,350 --> 00:38:49,580
i think you would surprise them if

1102
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:50,510
you showed them the dvd

1103
00:38:52,850 --> 00:38:55,940
so for for the past ten years

1104
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:56,900
i don't know when date night came

1105
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:58,640

1106
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:03,350
so last night i think sleep yeah

1107
00:39:03,650 --> 00:39:06,230
i just like cool it's for him

1108
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:08,330
cool appliques over your wig are you

1109
00:39:08,330 --> 00:39:08,900
thinking about data

1110
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:11,570
it's just so funny how people approach

1111
00:39:11,570 --> 00:39:12,800
their parents different because i was like

1112
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,090
why are you displaying this this is

1113
00:39:14,090 --> 00:39:15,470
so weird i may have said that

1114
00:39:15,470 --> 00:39:16,760
in there they go i don't know

1115
00:39:16,790 --> 00:39:18,890
but um but so last night i

1116
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:20,660
see that bird uf he might have

1117
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:22,700

you drink that wine and watch date

1169
00:41:02,035 --> 00:41:03,925
night randy finally figure out what the

1170
00:41:03,925 --> 00:41:05,485
fuck is going yeah so i don't

1171
00:41:05,485 --> 00:41:06,805
know but i'm gonna say you can't

1172
00:41:06,805 --> 00:41:08,875
open the wine until you figure out

1173
00:41:08,875 --> 00:41:10,465
what it has to do an excellent

1174
00:41:10,465 --> 00:41:12,085
way to celebrate we pop it up

1175
00:41:12,115 --> 00:41:14,185
once and yeah i'm wondering when the

1176
00:41:14,185 --> 00:41:14,667
one that's done

1177
00:41:15,055 --> 00:41:16,795
because if the is pretty old and

1178
00:41:16,795 --> 00:41:17,995
they have a dvd and it might

1179
00:41:17,995 --> 00:41:20,995
be really valuable wine probably sold it

1180
00:41:20,995 --> 00:41:22,105
could be worth a lot from the

1181
00:41:22,105 --> 00:41:23,455
movie um what have you tried to

1182
00:41:23,455 --> 00:41:25,525
sell it like date night wine this

1183
00:41:25,525 --> 00:41:26,995
has to do with the movie date-night

1184
00:41:27,115 --> 00:41:29,074
yeah i rarely tell there's one other

1185
00:41:29,074 --> 00:41:31,165
flu there's one other clue she mentioned

1186
00:41:31,165 --> 00:41:33,265
the word genealogy which i don't know

1187
00:41:33,265 --> 00:41:34,375
what it had and she didn't even

1188
00:41:34,375 --> 00:41:34,945
know she's like

1189
00:41:34,945 --> 00:41:35,785
like it has something to do with

1190
00:41:35,785 --> 00:41:39,115
genealogy or something i don't know what

1191
00:41:39,205 --> 00:41:42,175
i find but yeah writers of date-night

1192
00:41:42,175 --> 00:41:44,455
are listening to this going what we

1193
00:41:44,455 --> 00:41:44,905
did what

1194
00:41:46,315 --> 00:41:48,295
who but yeah see this is you

1195
00:41:48,295 --> 00:41:50,095
never know when you create something like

1196
00:41:50,095 --> 00:41:51,625
date night you never know who it's

1197
00:41:51,625 --> 00:41:54,145
gonna touch and and the tendrils that

1198
00:41:54,205 --> 00:41:55,705
are going to you know and that's

1199
00:41:55,705 --> 00:41:58,225
so beautiful yeah create a movie old

1200
00:41:58,225 --> 00:42:00,025
people make it weird around it so

1201
00:42:00,025 --> 00:42:02,515
be careful so the date night mystery

1202
00:42:02,575 --> 00:42:05,635
continues but is close to being solved

1203
00:42:05,845 --> 00:42:06,145
at lee

1204
00:42:06,145 --> 00:42:07,615
right now i know or i have

1205
00:42:07,615 --> 00:42:10,255
an idea of why they were displaying

1206
00:42:10,255 --> 00:42:11,995
date night because i think they wanted

1207
00:42:11,995 --> 00:42:13,495
to be good doesn't do it for

1208
00:42:13,525 --> 00:42:15,325
nine your sister if her sister ever

1209
00:42:15,325 --> 00:42:18,685
visited did she ever doubtful does she

1210
00:42:18,685 --> 00:42:20,095
live in another state or so yes

1211
00:42:20,155 --> 00:42:21,314
well they did at the time yeah

1212
00:42:21,314 --> 00:42:23,125
i didn't really see mike's mom doing

1213
00:42:23,125 --> 00:42:24,655
something like that to be nice to

1214
00:42:24,655 --> 00:42:26,305
the person like it's like out

1215
00:42:26,305 --> 00:42:27,805
out and then they come over she

1216
00:42:27,805 --> 00:42:29,335
puts it out yeah come over some

1217
00:42:29,535 --> 00:42:30,805
but i mean a lot of what

1218
00:42:30,805 --> 00:42:32,408
my mom so they get the wine

1219
00:42:32,408 --> 00:42:34,375

very win so maybe you were thoughtful

1231
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:57,775
when someone gives you something she feels

1232
00:42:57,805 --> 00:42:59,245
were when someone gives her something she

1233
00:42:59,245 --> 00:43:01,765
feels a responsibility to enjoy it to

1234
00:43:01,765 --> 00:43:03,685
the extent that she's making a little

1235
00:43:03,685 --> 00:43:06,295
shrine making trends but also she has

1236
00:43:06,325 --> 00:43:06,625

want to burn it out so we

1284
00:44:36,985 --> 00:44:37,765
waited for you

1285
00:44:38,605 --> 00:44:40,225
by the way there are score pads

1286
00:44:40,645 --> 00:44:42,295
she has done what she does with

1287
00:44:42,295 --> 00:44:43,615
all games she doesn't want to run

1288
00:44:43,615 --> 00:44:44,605
out of the score pads so she

1289
00:44:44,635 --> 00:44:46,615
xeroxed off all of the score pads

1290
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:49,555
made extra was oh my god they're

1291
00:44:49,585 --> 00:44:51,175
they're all just sitting there new in

1292
00:44:51,175 --> 00:44:53,065
this had never occurred to me to

1293
00:44:53,065 --> 00:44:56,185
do oh yeah wow so oh so

1294
00:44:56,194 --> 00:44:57,295

1297
00:44:59,665 --> 00:45:00,835
well this is what this is my

1298
00:45:00,865 --> 00:45:01,945
thing i don't think this is a

1299
00:45:01,945 --> 00:45:03,955
recurring game that we're gonna play ever

1300
00:45:03,955 --> 00:45:05,785
again we have our games as a

1301
00:45:05,785 --> 00:45:07,645
family that we play a lot and

1302
00:45:07,645 --> 00:45:08,575
i didn't think this was going to

1303
00:45:08,575 --> 00:45:10,015
be one of them so i'm like

1304
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:11,365
ok well i'll put it back so

1305
00:45:11,365 --> 00:45:13,285

00:45:15,355 --> 00:45:16,855
everything down during some of the stuff

1308
00:45:16,855 --> 00:45:18,055
on your head but no nothing

1309
00:45:18,145 --> 00:45:19,195
i'll buy my head but and i

1310
00:45:19,195 --> 00:45:20,875

1312
00:45:22,105 --> 00:45:23,185

1313
00:45:23,185 --> 00:45:25,225
had everything back where it was yes

1314
00:45:25,285 --> 00:45:27,085
okay because i knew it wasn't gonna

1315
00:45:27,092 --> 00:45:28,915
be in the current rotation and i

1316
00:45:28,915 --> 00:45:30,205
didn't want it to be sitting up

1317
00:45:30,265 --> 00:45:31,735
and it's like a fuckin jenga in

1318
00:45:31,735 --> 00:45:33,895
there yes yes yeah decide it back

1319
00:45:34,045 --> 00:45:35,395
so i put it exactly where it

1320
00:45:35,395 --> 00:45:36,835
was and it was a big ordeal

1321
00:45:36,835 --> 00:45:37,975
but i finally got it done

1322
00:45:38,575 --> 00:45:40,495
and then i then i go back

1323
00:45:40,495 --> 00:45:43,315
to where everyone played and there is

1324
00:45:43,315 --> 00:45:46,675
one card from the game bought there

1325
00:45:46,705 --> 00:45:48,145
like an essential non of paper it's

1326
00:45:48,205 --> 00:45:49,705
just one of the cards with questions

1327
00:45:49,705 --> 00:45:50,665

a lot i mean that was a

1332
00:45:59,575 --> 00:46:02,125

like no oh okay and then they're

1351
00:46:34,947 --> 00:46:36,235
one of the one of the questions

1352
00:46:36,235 --> 00:46:37,555
when we're playing the game was written

1353
00:46:37,555 --> 00:46:38,785
poorly that no one understood

1354
00:46:38,785 --> 00:46:40,345
i didn't and i said oh it's

1355
00:46:40,345 --> 00:46:43,195
that question anyway it doesn't matter lie

1356
00:46:43,585 --> 00:46:45,715
yeah but to make her feel better

1357
00:46:46,225 --> 00:46:48,505
i find out later she has dug

1358
00:46:48,505 --> 00:46:50,935
through the trash it's the guard boats

1359
00:46:51,625 --> 00:46:53,545
and was going to put it back

1360
00:46:53,545 --> 00:46:55,645
herself but then it had a lot

1361
00:46:55,645 --> 00:46:56,995
of like food on it and so

1362
00:46:56,995 --> 00:46:57,205

1363
00:46:58,645 --> 00:46:59,515
so she

1364
00:47:00,734 --> 00:47:02,335

wearing a house oh okay well that

1485
00:50:49,405 --> 00:50:51,265

1486
00:50:51,265 --> 00:50:53,635
i have my house that's sure ah

1487
00:50:54,115 --> 00:50:56,455
but then when the phillies ah should

1488
00:50:56,455 --> 00:50:59,935
they by some weird chance get knocked

1489
00:50:59,935 --> 00:51:02,005
out of the running i get for

1490
00:51:02,005 --> 00:51:02,545
the postseason

1491
00:51:03,850 --> 00:51:05,920
then i switch over to my dad

1492
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:07,930
drops right but what are these herbal

1493
00:51:07,930 --> 00:51:09,220
amount of them that you're talking about

1494
00:51:09,220 --> 00:51:10,720
that you are fond of are they

1495
00:51:10,730 --> 00:51:12,370
other teams are just phillies they're not

1496
00:51:12,370 --> 00:51:15,940
sports related oh i see some of

1497
00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:17,650
them are souvenir things some of them

1498
00:51:17,650 --> 00:51:19,810
are just cool things that happen along

1499
00:51:19,931 --> 00:51:20,320
ram

1500
00:51:22,270 --> 00:51:26,470
well okay so there's two claws yeah

1501
00:51:26,530 --> 00:51:28,870
one can only tell the truth um

1502
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:31,150
one is a little shallow closet where

1503
00:51:31,150 --> 00:51:33,580
we keep like our raincoats should we

1504
00:51:33,580 --> 00:51:35,650
ever need them in the shallow hello

1505
00:51:35,770 --> 00:51:38,290
yeah in the shallow closet and then

1506
00:51:38,290 --> 00:51:39,790
there's a shelf overhead where i keep

1507
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,650
the the baseball caps right

1508
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:43,300
yeah right but now it's too many

1509
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:47,117
baseball yeah and so i put all

1510
00:51:47,117 --> 00:51:48,970
of this the phillies ones up there

1511
00:51:49,930 --> 00:51:51,100
then i got all these other ones

1512
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:54,070
just like in the closet on top

1513
00:51:54,070 --> 00:51:55,600
of the shoe rack and stuff like

1514
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:57,730
that that's tough it's sloppy and messy

1515
00:51:57,730 --> 00:51:58,840
and it makes me feel what have

1516
00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:00,580
you i don't know if this is

1517
00:52:00,580 --> 00:52:01,720
a thing but i imagine it is

1518
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:01,810
like

1519
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:03,596
a sort of plea over admission to

1520
00:52:03,610 --> 00:52:05,740
or inside the closet being over the

1521
00:52:05,740 --> 00:52:09,010
door hanging thing that's like to basically

1522
00:52:09,250 --> 00:52:12,370
science it's honestly like the hats hanging

1523
00:52:12,370 --> 00:52:14,170
off of little peg i have seen

1524
00:52:14,170 --> 00:52:16,270
things like that there are mirrors inside

1525
00:52:16,270 --> 00:52:18,460
the closet door which makes it a

1526
00:52:18,460 --> 00:52:20,290
little bit difficult because it's like do

1527
00:52:20,290 --> 00:52:21,880
you want to cover up a mirror

1528
00:52:21,970 --> 00:52:24,880
your hats yeah and and frankly i

1529
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:26,140
don't yeah i don't think you don't

1530
00:52:26,140 --> 00:52:27,220
know that kind of guy the other

1531
00:52:27,220 --> 00:52:28,570
option is you get like a sort

1532
00:52:28,570 --> 00:52:30,700
of teddy bear and put an chair

1533
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:31,750
and then stack all the hats on

1534
00:52:31,750 --> 00:52:33,340
top of it yeah so the reason

1535
00:52:33,340 --> 00:52:34,870
i was feeling this i like yeah

1536
00:52:35,110 --> 00:52:37,360
i like this and it's almost it's

1537
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:38,500
as high as a stripper pole

1538
00:52:39,910 --> 00:52:41,590
and i that is to say like

1539
00:52:42,070 --> 00:52:44,350
hi yes stripper plants

1540
00:52:45,970 --> 00:52:46,870
high is a thing that was all

1541
00:52:46,870 --> 00:52:47,740
the way up to the ceiling guys

1542
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:50,800
yeah alright we have today arabic

1543
00:52:58,540 --> 00:53:00,220
and we're back and we're back and

1544
00:53:00,220 --> 00:53:03,580
it's time for one threesome know this

1545
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:05,920
richer one three don't go to one

1546
00:53:05,950 --> 00:53:08,590
freedom plaza and that's where you'll find

1547
00:53:08,620 --> 00:53:10,090
the creature museum by the way we

1548
00:53:10,090 --> 00:53:12,100
haven't talked about this this is early

1549
00:53:12,100 --> 00:53:13,900
morning threesome for all of us because

1550
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:16,120
we've ever recorded right yeah and so

1551
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:16,690
that's why we're

1552
00:53:16,690 --> 00:53:19,660
all our synapses are not firing correctly

1553
00:53:19,690 --> 00:53:21,040
we started i've been up for five

1554
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:23,121
hours but surely two yeah five thirty

1555
00:53:23,121 --> 00:53:24,940
yeah i woke up at five for

1556
00:53:24,940 --> 00:53:27,070
no reason yeah two hours before my

1557
00:53:27,070 --> 00:53:29,800
alarm and yet so that doesn't help

1558
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:31,270
because you just feel tired and it's

1559
00:53:31,270 --> 00:53:32,500
like one dog it's like i got

1560
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:34,000

you intended to wake up and you're

1566
00:53:44,050 --> 00:53:45,100
lying there in bed try to go

1567
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:46,079
actually you don't go back to sleep

1568
00:53:46,098 --> 00:53:47,590

in pitch it switching and pitches switching

1580
00:54:09,388 --> 00:54:11,110
the budget and dating back to our

it's one person pitches to two people

1587
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:27,580
yeah and ah ah the one person

1588
00:54:27,580 --> 00:54:31,750
who's pitching we give that person the

1589
00:54:31,780 --> 00:54:34,120
title of an existing television show or

1590
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:37,030
movie yes and they have to switch

1591
00:54:37,450 --> 00:54:41,050
every letter into the opposite letter no

1592
00:54:41,260 --> 00:54:43,360
this is not letter a word every

1593
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:46,210
word into the opposite word every other

1594
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:50,200
the directly opposite thirteen away on a

1595
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:51,040
sliding scale

1596
00:54:53,260 --> 00:54:55,120
yeah every every word is the like

1597
00:54:55,120 --> 00:54:56,470
an opposite word and then they have

1598
00:54:56,470 --> 00:54:59,140
to pitch that show and then at

1599
00:54:59,140 --> 00:55:00,010
the end of it they have to
