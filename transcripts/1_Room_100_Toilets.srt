247
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:50,970
somebody says is that real

248
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,850
i here's what i think of yeah

249
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:54,870
i think of

250
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,260
that movie that tv movie the late

251
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:00,630
shift was on a yeah with ah

252
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:03,600
what's ah john michael higgins yeah letterman

253
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:06,210

00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:14,850
he was executed in aj's garage whoa

257
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,470
no way no you were the paul

258
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:17,880
stewart and now you want if daniel

259
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,980

260
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:22,050
place when jay had the accident and

261
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:23,430
that's why he's he's like oh i

262
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:24,990
have facial scars from it but it

263
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:27,150
was really a off situation i like

264
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,560
that that's a really good idea like

265
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:29,850
i don't have really a face on

266
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:31,890
because that's what all the prosthetics but

267
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:32,340
someone had to

268
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,990
make a face off but here's what

269
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:35,580
will the fire took j's face off

270
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,626
but it didn't really it was it

271
00:09:37,626 --> 00:09:38,850
was it was a face aussie was

272
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:40,410
a total it was a total nothing

273
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:41,670
ever happened it was just the way

274
00:09:41,711 --> 00:09:44,820
they explained why he had scarring he

275
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:47,070
had something scars why don't you get

276
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:47,670
about

277
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:51,988
it's other i don't get it it's

278
00:09:51,988 --> 00:09:54,000
that i didn't know where he suffered

279
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:57,390
his damage his face his major malfunction

280
00:09:57,450 --> 00:09:59,940
yeah his major malfunction what's g's damage

281
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:02,370
he's some metro functions

282
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:04,370
yeah

283
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:14,180
so that's what i think of okay

284
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,979
so i think of rich little as

285
00:10:15,979 --> 00:10:18,410
johnny carson whole right he made some

286
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:20,600
announce that he's retiring or whatever and

287
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,430
then he walks off stage and he

288
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:24,135
says to whoever people are stunned that

289
00:10:24,135 --> 00:10:27,110
he says to whoever it's real i

290
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:29,450
said it it's real sad

291
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:33,110
anytime anybody questions the veracity they say

292
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:34,670
the word if they say is this

293
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:36,590
real or is that real you say

294
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:38,420
what i think it's real i have

295
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:39,980
to fight to not say about that

296
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,440
i feel like this one i don't

297
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,850
even know why it enters my head

298
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:46,130

299
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:47,540
thing about it and yep in my

300
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:49,610
head and the fr

know the film but the phrases why

303
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:55,970
because i don't think i am almost

387
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:50,660
the guys from this movie like nowadays

388
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:51,800

389
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:54,800

390
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,590
when he does he says um i

391
00:13:57,590 --> 00:13:58,010

392
00:13:58,010 --> 00:13:59,120
i don't remember how he gets into

393
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,250
it jonathan sheesh but he quits by

394
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:04,940
saying i quit i quit and i

395
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:06,920
won i despise i hate having that

396
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,270
in my head that is really annoying

397
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:09,620
to hear in your head yes so

398
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:10,820
when you come to like it when

399
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:11,870
it happened i didn't like when he

400
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:12,950
did it it comes up when you

401
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:14,690
want to quit things no if somebody

402
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:16,010
says if i hear somebody say i

403
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:17,810
quit or they quit or whatever

404
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:21,260

00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,160
if you do it don't tell me

like

465
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:27,230

466
00:16:27,230 --> 00:16:29,000
people were staying up till midnight every

467
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,770

there there's yeah i think can't type

471
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:37,700
it you've got a lot of people

00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:40,610
who were young lawyer about being hired

473
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:42,080
no i don't think it's different at

474
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,040
all i think if there's just don't

475
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,360
care about who don't have a job

476
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:45,530
people who are younger

477
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:48,560
kids and teens and there it wasn't

478
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:49,970
two maybes and twenty and only it

479
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:51,740
was tina good values johnny carson didn't

480
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:53,150

481
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:54,950
kidding me know if anyone's love you

482
00:16:54,962 --> 00:16:56,120
but like when i was a teenager

483
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,740
i loved watching conan and staying up

484
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:59,450
until mean yeah sure yeah no but

485
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:00,680
i mean when you're a teenager yeah

486
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:02,930
because you're you naturally stay up late

487
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:04,790
but i just don't know like how

488
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:05,690
carson was all

489
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:08,420
also the age of three channel tv

490
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,300
yeah and so there was it was

491
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:13,580
a and when people still had the

492
00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:15,860
the common viewing experience like the idea

493
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:17,095
of we're all watching this at the

494
00:17:17,095 --> 00:17:18,740
same yeah it was on at midnight

495
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:20,210
it wasn't new tens i live in

496
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:21,560
thirty it used time used to be

497
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,880
on a midnight and then he liked

498
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,830
negotiated to go back to eleven thirty

499
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:25,850
three midnight it was nigh

500
00:17:25,850 --> 00:17:28,100
ninety minutes long yeah but that's the

501
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:30,200
thing zeit is crazy even staying up

502
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,060
till eleven to watch the news is

503
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:34,820
like we're a weird idea me now

504
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:36,140
i don't know i think you're talking

505
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:37,880
specifically about yourself and you're making it

506
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,380
about everyone you're trying to make a

507
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:41,780
universal i think everyone stays up at

508
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:43,400
different hours some people stay up all

509
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,690
night sweet eleven some new i'm just

510
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:45,920
saying people who have to get up

511
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:46,010
at

512
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,480
six in the morning edge tool to

513
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:47,570
have

514
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,090
initial fanbase and tell me

515
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,960
i'm saying generally look yes there are

516
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:56,671
exceptions to your dumb exception slip up

517
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:59,600
but if there's only fucking basically one

518
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,850
show around at that time yeah if

519
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:03,710
you're awake that's what you're watching so

520
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:06,140
that means that anybody in the country

521
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:07,850
on any given night who is awake

522
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:08,900
and wants to watch tv it's gonna

523
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:11,180
watch that show specifically so that means

524
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:11,420
he's

525
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:13,670
famous and everyone cares like it'll balance

526
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:15,140
out everyone will eventually watch it it's

527
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:16,490
gonna happen and then he's probably hosting

528
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:17,660
all sorts of other things and you're

529
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:19,400
like i'm gonna steps manually night and

530
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,440
watching it finds a way you know

531
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:24,470
before before your baby did you have

532
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:26,840
the same problem oh yeah well yes

533
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,314

537
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:34,460
early but but if you knew there

538
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:35,600
was a tv show you interact you

539
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,710

00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:59,690
lot of that and of me in

556
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:01,670
that scenario i think i'd be a

557
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:04,280
big carson hey i think i'd be

558
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:06,500
saying johnny carson you're the best you're

559
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,120
my king this is applicable i was

560
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:11,060
trying to watch coachella this last weekend

561
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:13,220
only likes a monologue and then i

562
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:17,330
go frank ocean does the book um

563
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,320
but i was trying to stay up

564
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,760
to see some of the later things

565
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,520
in black paint came on at nine

566
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:24,560
thirty and add a half hour i

567
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:27,620
was like i guy that's you i'm

568
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:30,740
betting yes but i i think that

569
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,090
i have that in common with

570
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:34,070
people especially during the work you're not

571
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:35,510
alone i don't think you're alone and

572
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:36,590
all but i think if if someone's

573
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:38,810
like i'm going to watch coachella it's

574
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:40,220
this person i want to see your

575
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:41,570
group is on at nine thirty but

576
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:43,070
that's fine dvd to take a break

577
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:45,200
that's so unfair

578
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:57,770
and we're back oh how convenient these

579
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:58,121
things

580
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:01,910
provably have audiences i know i'm just

581
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:03,500
saying that nobody like people aren't lying

582
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:04,910
like my wife stayed up till like

583
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,610
thirty but my question is what how

584
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:09,350
was life different for people back then

585
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:10,940
why how could they do it right

586
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,230
you know what i mean like what

587
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,940

596
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:29,420

598
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:33,080

00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:42,770
it also like really fun because i

00:24:42,770 --> 00:24:43,670
feel like i got to go away

715
00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:44,750
we were able to face time and

716
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:45,200
she wasn't up

717
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,580
upset which is like a new thing

718
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:49,130
she's like cry some amp nice and

719
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:49,970
so now it was like we got

720
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,350
to cry when you saw your face

721
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:52,760
because i wasn't there like she would

722
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,110
like be like i want to like

723
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:56,330

having fun on face time and then

726
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:00,770
by the last day it was kind

727
00:25:00,770 --> 00:25:02,210
of like too many days do you

728
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:04,550
think she would cry if she was

729
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:05,360
watching the wrong miss

730
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,290
see and you are just the other

731
00:25:06,290 --> 00:25:09,200
room um yeah she probably cried she

732
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:11,480
gets really offended by like potty humor

733
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:12,140
no

734
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:15,500
um but her reaction when i got

735
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:16,400
home was so sweet that i was

736
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,690
like i should leave more often just

737
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:19,340

738
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:21,890

you are your real friends most of

856
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:42,080
the time and rarely get some champagne

857
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:43,730
for your event and i think i

859
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,960
would go to eight weddings for one

860
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,730
person over the course of my life

861
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:50,960
i would go from one person i

862
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,280
would go to four weddings and one

863
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,870
funeral yeah who's

864
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,870
well that person oh okay yeah i

865
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:58,130
think because i figured that by the

866
00:29:58,130 --> 00:29:59,750
time you're like the third one for

867
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:02,060
that person because like two having been

868
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:03,410
married twice island it's that big of

869
00:30:03,410 --> 00:30:06,200
a deal to go to but after

870
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,240
that point it's just getting interesting well

871
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:09,290
now you're like i'm here for the

872
00:30:09,290 --> 00:30:11,000
spectacle yeah what's up with this person

873
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,920
what's with their family when i went

874
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,180
to my friend's second

875
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:15,500
if the second one i was like

876
00:30:15,650 --> 00:30:17,300
this might be it for me and

877
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:19,190
then there was a third but i

878
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:20,750
was not delighted to think that there

879
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:22,310
was going to be a third at

880
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:23,870
the second i kind of was like

881
00:30:23,870 --> 00:30:24,890
i wonder if there's gonna be a

882
00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:26,510
third yeah i thought it was going

883
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:27,890
to be well i mean the odds

884
00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:29,990
are fifty fifty but i i was

885
00:30:29,990 --> 00:30:31,070

00:31:57,869 --> 00:31:59,390
like this has happened to me where

924
00:31:59,390 --> 00:32:01,340
i meet i meet someone for presumably

925
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:02,360
the first time and they say oh

926
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:04,220
i was at your wedding yeah and

927
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:05,540
i go wet and i know they

928
00:32:05,570 --> 00:32:05,717
they

929
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:08,120
we're dating someone that used to date

930
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:10,460
shah that i well like when mike

931
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:12,770
and i got married but you don't

932
00:32:12,770 --> 00:32:16,040
so you mow somebody's girlfriend who is

933
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,960
so small that we had nobody there

934
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,310
that we had not met so that

935
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:20,360
was kind of nice because you know

936
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:21,680
the happiness you're meeting someone on like

937
00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:23,330
most important day of your life yeah

938
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,950
but then you forced your guest to

939
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:25,880
meet other people

940
00:32:26,090 --> 00:32:27,350
yeah which i think is not fair

941
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:29,780
a lot of meeting happening on sometimes

942
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,700
your wedding news it was interesting because

943
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:32,750
you were like ok everyone looks to

944
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:34,280

945
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:36,770
right by tomorrow one person won't be

946
00:32:36,770 --> 00:32:38,930
here yeah yeah and it was realised

947
00:32:38,930 --> 00:32:39,140
because

948
00:32:41,090 --> 00:32:42,470
yeah yeah it was just a place

949
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:43,910
where it was like rachel came into

950
00:32:43,910 --> 00:32:46,400
the plant yeah yeah um what about

951
00:32:46,430 --> 00:32:48,170
if somebody's getting married a bunch of

952
00:32:48,170 --> 00:32:51,140
times and you're like you feel like

953
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:52,880
oh they shouldn't do this yeah that's

954
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,440
how that's kind of where i was

955
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,760
out with when i was at my

956
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,830
friend's second wedding i was like i

957
00:32:57,830 --> 00:32:59,810
don't think they're taking it all that

958
00:32:59,810 --> 00:33:00,440
serious

959
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:01,880
mostly so i don't know if i

960
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:04,040
come in like co-sign another one you

961
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,571
know what i mean another one i

962
00:33:05,571 --> 00:33:07,340
thought i was asked to officiate a

963
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:12,110
wedding once and i declined because calvin

964
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:13,640
klein i did because it was calvin

965
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:15,260
klein e d client and i said

966

you're married fashion

967
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:20,120
being honest um and i i did

968
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:21,500
not think it was a good idea

969
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:23,450
wow i think any better mind the

970
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:24,860
invitation but you didn't say to thy

971
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:26,630
decline to officiate the wedding but you

972
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:28,010
went to shit but i was still

973
00:33:28,010 --> 00:33:29,810
invited to the wedding and here i

974
00:33:29,810 --> 00:33:32,450
think that's another family another mutual no

975
00:33:32,450 --> 00:33:35,630
one gave me an out by suggesting

976
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:37,400
to this this mutual

977
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,480
a friend of ours there was a

978
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,800
bad idea to have me officiate the

979
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:42,140
wedding which i was like oh come

980
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:44,930
on maybe he sucks did their wedding

981
00:33:44,930 --> 00:33:46,130
i can get something else and in

982
00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:49,550
divorce yes it did many years later

983
00:33:49,550 --> 00:33:51,230
i found out it was a horrible

984
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:55,430
marriage and i um i felt i

985
00:33:55,430 --> 00:33:57,380
felt terrible for this person that's horrible

986
00:33:57,770 --> 00:33:59,060
it was but it was like worse

987
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:00,800
than i would have imagined wow and

988
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:04,010
i was really i retired because i

989
00:34:04,010 --> 00:34:05,690
was not close enough to this person

990
00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:07,700
this to say you shouldn't marry this

991
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:09,260
portray but you but they thought you

992
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:11,450
were close enough that you should officiate

993
00:34:11,450 --> 00:34:12,860
it but there's kind of yeah that's

994
00:34:12,870 --> 00:34:14,600
a very specific world it is yeah

995
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:17,720
but also like telling someone that may

996
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:18,920
basically is not going to lead to

997
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,570
anything besides you being an asshole you're

998
00:34:20,570 --> 00:34:22,520

1038
00:35:33,950 --> 00:35:35,330
no matter how you feel about it

1039
00:35:35,690 --> 00:35:36,980
just don't do it don't do it

1040
00:35:37,213 --> 00:35:40,100
someone who's obviously you think it's it's

1041
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:41,390
worth saying that if you're in a

1042
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:43,130
situation like that you do not have

1043
00:35:43,130 --> 00:35:44,930
to do it and it doesn't matter

1044
00:35:44,930 --> 00:35:46,460
how much money the wedding costs yeah

1045
00:35:46,466 --> 00:35:48,320
doesn't matter what pressure yeah and all

1046
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,840
that stuff it's impossible to see them

1047
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:51,560
although

1048
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:54,590
though anything above five grand prize she

1049
00:35:54,590 --> 00:35:55,610
just got through you should just go

1050
00:35:55,610 --> 00:35:56,720
through but you know you don't have

1051
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,160
to do is submit the marriage license

1052
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,710
to the government true yeah you have

1053
00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:02,210
to pay them anything you don't have

1054
00:36:02,210 --> 00:36:04,040
to pay tax you can try not

1055
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:06,290
paying taxes is illegal yes you actually

1056
00:36:06,290 --> 00:36:07,670
have to go through with the wedding

1057
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:09,050
and then you could just not send

1058
00:36:09,050 --> 00:36:10,850
that paper in and then when you

1059
00:36:10,850 --> 00:36:11,690
want to end it

1060
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:13,970
you're not married that's a good point

1061
00:36:13,970 --> 00:36:15,140
you just keep the paper and you

1062
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:16,910
say to your significant other like oh

1063
00:36:16,910 --> 00:36:17,955
yeah i sent that in do you

1064
00:36:17,955 --> 00:36:19,070

1065
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:20,270
find out when you get married when

1066
00:36:20,270 --> 00:36:21,830
you get the license you're essentially married

1067
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:24,350
um it's kind of an anticlimax what

1068
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:25,580
what's that when you get when you

1069
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:27,200

big giant plate of fried chicken everyone

1178
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:26,990

if you are over

1192
00:40:54,185 --> 00:40:56,405

at twelve or younger idea any person

1199
00:41:11,315 --> 00:41:13,775
why we're fixated on over twelve was

1200
00:41:13,865 --> 00:41:16,325
that's when kids start to become dense

1201
00:41:16,955 --> 00:41:18,125
i just mean if you're under twelve
