34
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:33,540

out

37
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:38,760

has a personal trainer over here and

40
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:45,510
i think the only seven i think

41
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:46,950
the only reason anyone ever says that

42
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:48,240
is because they want you to comment

43
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,130
on their body so kevin very nice

44
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:51,840

00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,700
that and you said we're gonna spank

54
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,320

55
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:15,750

57
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:20,250
the morning wondering why he is still

58
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:25,410
thinking about you na mic mix um

59
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:28,200
so we're talking about personal trainers and

60
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,310

65
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:36,450
it's like part of the problem for

66
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:37,620
all of us as we're saying is

67
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:40,470
the feeling like it's it's not necessary

68
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:41,850
like no one's saying you have to

69
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:43,110
be there or you're gonna like i

70
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:44,700
liked it yeah someone waiting for me

71
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,590
and then like i if i don't

72
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:48,630
show up they're disappointed or something that's

73
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:50,730

had a director

199
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:46,020
it was an director it wasn't director

200
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:48,600
include you're giving us so i said

201
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,640
it was around two thousand i i

202
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:52,350
went to a gym and they convinced

203
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:54,390
me to get a personal trainer because

204
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:56,760
a workshop please he worked at the

205
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,740
gym and so it was a nice

206
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:00,690
situation for a while because he worked

207
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:03,330
yeah nice situation i was there

208
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,312
he was there he trained me hey

209
00:07:05,312 --> 00:07:07,560
those guys it was good it all

210
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,690
worked out emily money gave me a

211
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:11,781
service for the money i like a

212
00:07:11,791 --> 00:07:16,260
late fee but then then what i

213
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:19,020
guess he downs fell off so bad

214
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:20,880
it was it was like there's nothing

215
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,500
better than interrupting is already going to

216
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:23,490
get going and then

217
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,410
he's literally about to say like what

218
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:28,020
and then and then what

219
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:29,610
finish

220
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,140
yeah this so then i guess he

221
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:37,350
got fired from the gym um but

222
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:38,610
he's still wanted to train me and

223
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:39,810
i was used to him so he

224
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:42,090
was like but now he's damaged goods

225
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,500
well no but he couldn't come into

226
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:46,620
the gym viable ally because he was

227
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:48,810
fired from it but why i don't

228
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:50,160

232
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,990

curious yeah well you know how to

275
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:46,410
access your hobby he has to split

276
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:47,970
it with the gym when when you

277
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:48,660
were know him

278
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:53,610
do you know jim's ooh nobody got

279
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:55,650
fired when do you even know jims

280
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:58,350
he's the arrangement previous was that he

281
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:00,930
would split it with the g yeah

282
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,970
for guys hey guys i can't listen

283
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:05,580
to a story-wise say i pay eighty

284
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,290
dollars for a session when he works

285
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:08,700
you pay eight dollars for a session

286
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:09,840
he gets forty or

287
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,500
yeah whatever and the gym gets a

288
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,060
cut shorter so now that you didn't

289
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:17,962
get to when somebody isn't working at

290
00:10:17,962 --> 00:10:20,010
the gym he says kiss stay on

291
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:22,290
with me and i'll get i'll let

292
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:23,970
you have do it for sixty because

293
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:25,590
any keeps did he say keystone

294
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,200
it's like christiane

295
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:32,490
so i think this is a good

296
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:35,100
arrangement because it's cheaper same guy is

297
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,660
cheaper but he doesn't have all the

298
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:37,860
equipment so i have to go over

299
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:40,440
his house or apartment it was like

300
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:43,020
a bungalow okay said he also does

301
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:44,820
all over the place this is our

302
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,190
history oh yeah and is the other

303
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:48,720
guy in the other bungalow wanting to

304
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,380
be a singer

305
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:50,670
or in a band and this is

306
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:51,750
the year two thousand and it looks

307
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:53,760
exactly like scott weiland i was like

308
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,870
well what's your style what's your band

309
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:56,070
styles like well we're sort of like

310
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,690
stp and i was like yeah no

311
00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:00,750
kidding yeah so down to the looks

312
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,244
so i go over i would go

313
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:06,510
to his house and he would do

314
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:08,910
the stuff with me right so then

315
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:10,800
but here's the other wrinkle he keeps

316
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,890
wanting advances he keeps saying like can

317
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:15,210
you can you give it to me

318
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:16,740
like can you give me the next

319
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:20,010
six months jesus yeah yeah yeah well

320
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:21,090
and then why were you going to

321
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:21,840
his house

322
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:23,190
it's not that five days a week

323
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,960
but how often how often yeah it's

324
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,060
probably four days a week five thousand

325
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:29,130
six months ridiculous events on four days

326
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:30,960
a week yeah what's a lot and

327
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,760
he kept like and then he'd go

328
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:35,610
he'd go you know ah i just

329
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:36,930
needed for the three months and then

330
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:37,980
it kept it was like i was

331
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:39,210
paying a year in advance at one

332
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:41,340
point i think and so then like

333
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:42,180
a commitment to yourself

334
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:43,680
so yeah the guy was a mess

335
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:47,820
so then ah september eleventh two thousand

336
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:49,680
and one happens you guys are this

337
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:51,060

482
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:12,780

632
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:15,490
it's not private but i don't feel

633
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:17,620
like telling you okay it's not private

634
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:19,360
but this dirty yeah it's sick and

635
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:19,900
wrong

636
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:22,960
the thing is okay so i'm i'm

637
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:27,670
basically doing something bulking no but i

638
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:30,010
but my my thing is what i

639
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,990

684
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,120

am because it's happening but i and

686
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:54,734
and and at some point probably well

687
00:24:54,734 --> 00:24:55,870
it's easy but i have to say

688
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:56,890

693
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:05,230
thing that i would be talking about

694
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:06,670
because it was annoying had this thing

695
00:25:06,670 --> 00:25:08,080
happen with it there's a whole story

00:33:28,105 --> 00:33:30,205
your core it it wasn't as much

929
00:33:30,205 --> 00:33:32,245
of a joke as the joke part

930
00:33:32,245 --> 00:33:32,845
of it was

931
00:33:33,025 --> 00:33:35,215
me saying like haha i've i've done

932
00:33:35,245 --> 00:33:37,165
this is my nickname already but i

933
00:33:37,165 --> 00:33:38,425
still thought it was a good nickname

934
00:33:38,845 --> 00:33:40,525
so i still yeah i'm just fun

935
00:33:40,555 --> 00:33:43,405
so i still was elias being called

936
00:33:43,405 --> 00:33:45,565
it i don't get it well then

937
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:47,155
my then my teacher sat me down

938
00:33:47,155 --> 00:33:50,065
was like my my whole school i

939
00:33:50,065 --> 00:33:51,565
need to tell him believes my whole

940
00:33:51,565 --> 00:33:52,890
school thing was like my chair

941
00:33:53,158 --> 00:33:54,145
i'm trying to figure out how to

942
00:33:54,145 --> 00:33:56,785
manage me and so they like us

943
00:33:56,785 --> 00:33:59,155
so they they basically were sapped sat

944
00:33:59,155 --> 00:34:00,355
me down to try to get me

945
00:34:00,355 --> 00:34:01,705
to admit it wasn't my real name

946
00:34:01,765 --> 00:34:05,005
oh my jerri and intervention honestly i

947
00:34:05,005 --> 00:34:07,255
would totally do that too because when

948
00:34:07,255 --> 00:34:09,325
someone doesn't like that like that can

949
00:34:09,325 --> 00:34:10,855
be so crazy and when you know

950
00:34:10,855 --> 00:34:12,355
they're lying and you're like i just

951
00:34:12,355 --> 00:34:13,195
gotta get to the bottom of

952
00:34:13,225 --> 00:34:15,950
this like telling me the fucking nobody

953
00:34:15,985 --> 00:34:17,515
it wasn't just about flying and they

954
00:34:17,515 --> 00:34:19,165
will not admit that they're lying even

955
00:34:19,165 --> 00:34:20,515
if it's a dumb thing it is

956
00:34:20,545 --> 00:34:22,324
a man and even more if it's

957
00:34:22,324 --> 00:34:23,455
a dumb thing if it wasn't done

958
00:34:23,455 --> 00:34:25,345
that way it was telling me it

959
00:34:25,345 --> 00:34:27,145
was done with the sense of like

960
00:34:27,175 --> 00:34:28,735
you know you're going to be moving

961
00:34:28,735 --> 00:34:30,595
onto because his actions and they think

962
00:34:30,595 --> 00:34:32,215
you were like you're gonna be moving

963
00:34:32,215 --> 00:34:33,385
onto your professional

964
00:34:33,415 --> 00:34:35,185
career and so you know you really

965
00:34:35,185 --> 00:34:36,775
have to think about like what your

966
00:34:36,775 --> 00:34:39,745
name professionally is going to be and

967
00:34:39,745 --> 00:34:40,765
so there can't be a lot of

968
00:34:40,765 --> 00:34:42,835
confusion about it and so have you

969
00:34:42,835 --> 00:34:45,145
thought about this you know because i

970
00:34:45,145 --> 00:34:46,675
hear some people call you scott some

971
00:34:46,675 --> 00:34:48,685
people call you jackson you know is

972
00:34:48,685 --> 00:34:50,455
like i was like yeah that's really

973
00:34:50,455 --> 00:34:51,565
interest but there was a period of

974
00:34:51,565 --> 00:34:52,915
time where i was like that's really

975
00:34:52,915 --> 00:34:53,395
interesting

976
00:34:54,565 --> 00:34:55,825
that's how i dealt with all of

977
00:34:55,825 --> 00:34:58,195
that myself like literally my point look

978
00:34:58,195 --> 00:35:00,115
at the time but there was a

979
00:35:00,115 --> 00:35:01,315
time where i was kind of like

980
00:35:01,585 --> 00:35:04,255
should that be on my headshots because

981
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:07,195
just saying jackson quotes will i have

982
00:35:07,195 --> 00:35:08,995
a last name also the ottoman part

983
00:35:08,995 --> 00:35:11,215
of it was like x no no

984
00:35:11,215 --> 00:35:12,265
i was for a minute i was

985
00:35:12,265 --> 00:35:13,465
like jackson oc remember that i was

986
00:35:13,465 --> 00:35:13,645
like

987
00:35:13,705 --> 00:35:16,435
zuckerman is terrible please okay here's action

988
00:35:16,465 --> 00:35:18,385
here's what's making me like laugh about

989
00:35:18,385 --> 00:35:22,495
this it's so vulnerable for you to

990
00:35:22,495 --> 00:35:24,205
go call me jackson

991
00:35:26,425 --> 00:35:28,165
not done in a vulnerable manner by

992
00:35:28,165 --> 00:35:29,995
the way old gambit it was me

993
00:35:30,025 --> 00:35:32,251
it was me like doing it as

994
00:35:32,335 --> 00:35:34,645
a like huh it was almost like

995
00:35:34,645 --> 00:35:36,055
the woman saying she's pregnant too yeah

996
00:35:36,055 --> 00:35:37,045
okay so it's really bad

997
00:35:39,055 --> 00:35:42,265
um it was basically like so it's

998
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:43,675
like trying to you and if you

999
00:35:43,705 --> 00:35:44,335
call me on it

1000
00:35:45,745 --> 00:35:47,905
but um but then i then i

1001
00:35:47,905 --> 00:35:49,675
thought about our arnold schwarzenegger and i

1002
00:35:49,675 --> 00:35:51,295
was like well he's gotta get in

1003
00:35:51,295 --> 00:35:53,185
line he's got a terrible name and

1004
00:35:53,185 --> 00:35:55,435
i'm doing my mom and but now

1005
00:35:55,465 --> 00:35:57,115
when you hear schwarzenegger no one else

1006
00:35:57,115 --> 00:35:59,215
has that name so it's like oh

1007
00:35:59,215 --> 00:36:00,565
it's a good name for him because

1008
00:36:00,565 --> 00:36:01,735
he made his mark so that's why

1009
00:36:01,735 --> 00:36:03,745
i was like you know what argument

1010
00:36:03,745 --> 00:36:05,215
is fine even though i'm not really

1011
00:36:05,215 --> 00:36:05,545
liking

1012
00:36:05,545 --> 00:36:07,195
incredibly fond of it no one else

1013
00:36:07,195 --> 00:36:09,745
has it um and so that's also

1014
00:36:09,745 --> 00:36:11,275
why during the bang bang tv show

1015
00:36:11,275 --> 00:36:12,895

00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:27,200
to have to put on the whole

1242
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:28,460

1260
00:45:03,350 --> 00:45:05,240
i what i did ah you know

1261
00:45:05,270 --> 00:45:06,920
a couple episodes of you're the worst

1262
00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:10,040
and there was an episode where you're

1263
00:45:10,070 --> 00:45:13,190
any eligible for that right yeah yeah

1264
00:45:13,220 --> 00:45:15,080
so just to try to get the

1265
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:17,660
campaign going yeah yeah i'm honest

1266
00:45:17,666 --> 00:45:19,580
i'm not a big awards person but

1267
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:21,740
i wouldn't mind finding an award you

1268
00:45:21,740 --> 00:45:24,410
probably weren't good in it i think

1269
00:45:24,410 --> 00:45:25,729
i did a good job so people

1270
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:26,930
would check it out and if you're

1271
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:28,940
anything like our television academy voter i

1272
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:29,870
was a big fan of the show

1273
00:45:29,870 --> 00:45:30,950
and i was very grateful that i

1274
00:45:30,950 --> 00:45:32,930
got to do right um but there

1275
00:45:32,930 --> 00:45:34,550
was so there was one episode where

1276
00:45:35,090 --> 00:45:37,820
alan mcleod's character um get something in

1277
00:45:37,850 --> 00:45:39,260
his eyes and he has an allergic

1278
00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:40,790
reaction so they put all this makeup

1279
00:45:40,790 --> 00:45:42,920
on his eyes but that meant that

1280
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:45,410
his eyes were effectively sealed shut yeah

1281
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:46,460
and so he had to be led

1282
00:45:46,460 --> 00:45:49,580
around all day saying hey honey it

1283
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:52,460
was a bathroom raese i think he

1284
00:45:52,460 --> 00:45:54,080
could see how like he had to

1285
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:56,000
mind where his penis was as a

1286
00:45:56,030 --> 00:45:57,980
