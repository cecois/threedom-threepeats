website on someone's blog there so are

now writing their vodka st i read

80
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,460
this on a mommy blog there are

81
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:13,470
no side effects from sinking a tampa

82
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:15,360
or why it's probably a myth so

83
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,280
are people really taking their vitals straight-up

84
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,070
the june or the poon it's highly

85
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:21,060
unlikely boom

86
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:24,900
a noon for any picking this up

87
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:27,780
vagina or anus god god i got

88
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:29,820
it first any evidence of people actually

89
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:32,130
doing this is purely anecdotal it seems

90
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:33,690
that most stories come by way of

91
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:35,220
a friend of a friend's cousin well

92
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:36,630
let's just do it will tell well

93
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:39,000
yeah come on like that was that

94
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:41,100
time it was just an emphasis right

95
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:42,160
now but no but

96
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,168
you set a timer i will just

97
00:03:43,168 --> 00:03:45,330
see what happens how drunk can i

98
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:47,880
get i do that i've never thought

99
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,560
about it being a an urban legend

100
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,850
but it kind of makes sense because

101
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,490
either way harrison major risks okay here's

102
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:55,440
either way if you were able to

103
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,510
successfully as it was you not be

104
00:03:57,510 --> 00:03:59,910
successful that's it's easier than a pussy

105
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:02,070
it's easier than uzi

106
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:04,740
even if you were able to successfully

107
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:06,750
do this buck to tip ups up

108
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,580
your ass you could do it's easier

109
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:10,080
than pussy you could do some serious

110
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,640
harm tampa may not hold a lot

111
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,470
of vodka but what high school this

112
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,090
what it does hold gets into your

113
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:17,490
bloodstream quickly because it bypasses your stomach

114
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,230
i even bother cities and absorbed by

115
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:20,850
your stomach you can't vomit it out

116
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:22,560
if you've had yeah

117
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:26,760
that's why now we upstand there there's

118
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,590
the ouch factor to consider doesn't the

that was before it was really a

766
00:27:04,145 --> 00:27:04,415
thing

767
00:27:09,575 --> 00:27:11,555

down there i would think

838
00:29:17,705 --> 00:29:18,755
it would take a while to get

839
00:29:18,755 --> 00:29:19,655
down yeah it was supposed to be

840
00:29:19,655 --> 00:29:21,185
a one day excursion maybe it was

841
00:29:21,185 --> 00:29:22,595
one day and you have no seniors

842
00:29:22,595 --> 00:29:24,755
kind of like lying down look what

843
00:29:25,348 --> 00:29:26,735

846
00:29:30,665 --> 00:29:31,715
that was just like

847
00:29:32,945 --> 00:29:34,505

right beforehand yes so that story is

852
00:29:41,705 --> 00:29:44,165
so tragic but um it's an rpg

853
00:29:44,174 --> 00:29:45,935
i would be so afraid it's enraging

854
00:29:46,265 --> 00:29:47,855
i also you know one thing my

855
00:29:47,945 --> 00:29:49,445
memory and that's my big fear though

856
00:29:49,445 --> 00:29:51,335
is to die like anytime i see

857
00:29:51,335 --> 00:29:52,805
a movie that's set in space and

858
00:29:52,805 --> 00:29:52,985
they're like

859
00:29:52,985 --> 00:29:55,925
like oh no this thing broke yeah

860
00:29:55,955 --> 00:29:57,575
and we can't get back to earth

861
00:29:57,575 --> 00:29:59,975
and i just that and being underwater

862
00:30:00,005 --> 00:30:01,685
and trapped knowing you're gonna die is

863
00:30:01,685 --> 00:30:03,395
just like my biggest my biggest fear

864
00:30:03,395 --> 00:30:05,345
other than falling downstairs are my three

865
00:30:05,375 --> 00:30:07,865
because every fear i have is on

866
00:30:07,865 --> 00:30:08,975
the list and those are on there

867
00:30:08,975 --> 00:30:10,535
as well i have a fear that's

868
00:30:10,535 --> 00:30:13,145
like that where i'm afraid of ah

869
00:30:13,235 --> 00:30:15,935
being attacked by a big long headed

870
00:30:15,935 --> 00:30:19,145
alien whose spit is acid well that's

871
00:30:19,145 --> 00:30:21,125
really scary yeah one thing i just

872
00:30:21,125 --> 00:30:22,835
want to smooth operation stay away from

873
00:30:23,195 --> 00:30:24,785
by the way i think i think

874
00:30:25,355 --> 00:30:28,295
you should stay away from ah should

875
00:30:28,295 --> 00:30:30,815
stay away from home alien alien to

876
00:30:30,815 --> 00:30:31,625
the third power

877
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,060
and cubed can i just say one

878
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:37,010
thing about submarines yes so they only

879
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,392
only one and never going to stop

880
00:30:38,392 --> 00:30:39,590
i know that's it there's a new

881
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:41,720
three-term always willing to okay you each

882
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:42,920
get one so think about what you're

883
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:44,030
gonna say okay but not while i'm

884
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:47,150
talking about mine they each age they

885
00:30:47,150 --> 00:30:50,540
bolt the ah from the outside yeah

886
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:53,330
and they put seventy there's eighteen bolts

887
00:30:53,330 --> 00:30:53,660
and yet they

888
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:54,830
i do seventeen of them and i

889
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:56,660
wonder why is that i heard about

890
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:58,460
this i did not hear about that

891
00:30:58,670 --> 00:31:00,110
and i disagree the idea that you're

892
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:02,510
being bolted in from the outside and

893
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:04,520
that even if the thing popped up

894
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,380
to the surface of the wall wouldn't

895
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:07,160
be able to get you wouldn't able

896
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,150
to get out that's what they have

897
00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:09,350
done they have a porthole where they're

898
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:11,510
like i don't like an indiana jones

he has to get in portal and

905
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,210

guy i think about these these fucking

947
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:46,670
rich guides that yeah who wants to

948
00:32:46,670 --> 00:32:48,170
eat for the ocean they want to

949
00:32:48,170 --> 00:32:50,210
explore space they always have to do

950
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:53,930
it there's existing entities that you ride

951
00:32:54,050 --> 00:32:55,880
part of yeah but they're like no

952
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:56,630
i have to build it and be

953
00:32:56,630 --> 00:32:57,800
the boss of so because it's there

954
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:58,220
i don't know

955
00:32:58,220 --> 00:32:59,450
what the fuck i'm talking to is

956
00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:02,780
there already a james cameron built thing

957
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:04,160
to see that these know because he

958
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:06,228
sought yeah but he like it already

959
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,990
paid he geiser he is somebody who

960
00:33:09,290 --> 00:33:11,870
made his own money like wasn't born

961
00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:14,330
in money and in an industry where

962
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:16,250
safety was a thing that's talked about

963
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:18,320
all the fucking time yeah thank because

964
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:18,380
he

965
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:19,760
he's got a boss and he's responsible

966
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,288
to somebody yeah you know and then

967
00:33:21,288 --> 00:33:23,000
that's the crucial difference yeah and then

968
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,130
these guys are just like that because

969
00:33:25,727 --> 00:33:27,920
this fucking guy first wanted to build

970
00:33:28,010 --> 00:33:29,300
a rocket he wanted to go to

971
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:31,280
mars and then it was like wow

972
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:32,750
that's not that profitable so i'm gonna

973
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:34,880
go off to do the dad yeah

974
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:36,860
that'll be my fun little business but

975
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:38,510
it's really well because we have the

976
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:40,040
movie titanic you can see all the

977
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:43,580
things yeah exactly yeah and that's that's

978
00:33:43,583 --> 00:33:45,050

it's ah it's it's not about if

1080
00:37:23,570 --> 00:37:25,220
we're playing it correctly or not correctly

1081
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:27,140

1082
00:37:27,830 --> 00:37:28,940

1083
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:32,870
