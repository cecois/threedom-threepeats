you're blue and you have antennae yes

93
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:32,280
so star wars has blue people yeah

94
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,680
mentioning stores we're talking about star trek

95
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,110
because that ah sige cad bane is

96
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:39,450
blue that's true countering is blue i

97
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:40,740
wonder if they're the same

98
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:41,910
race yeah for sure

99
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,630
um yeah because they're both but listening

100
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:48,360
on like but here's landing rock good

101
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,880
point so as goodfellas was really blue

102
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:51,240
in that

103
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:54,780
um but here's the thing as of

104
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:57,270
this recording i've yet to be wished

105
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,590
a happy birthday by dennis to typewriter

106
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,030
and what i like him what's happening

107
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:01,260
now is that there's no way they

108
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:03,120
can hear this no this will be

109
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:05,430
they can't this guy tip to do

110
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:08,280
that they're still in there still in

111
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,868
the running to wish me happy birthday

112
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:10,980
but here's my theory

113
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:13,890
star trek has a list of every

114
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:15,480
single person who's on it and what

115
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,190
their birthday is and they just roll

116
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:18,360
it out every single day it's like

117
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:20,160
a checklist for whoever runs that account

118
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,270
yeah dynasty what else do they have

119
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:23,280
to do dynasty typewriter happened to see

120
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,570

00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:26,070
happy birthday that day no let me

122
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:28,260
tell you something maybe dynasty typewriter puts

123
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:29,670
out a calendar every oh they do

331
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:21,512
here's what we're working with this is

332
00:11:21,551 --> 00:11:23,180
kind of suggestion they got this they

333
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:25,400
like this i think we're okay with

334
00:11:25,416 --> 00:11:26,720
just how we're gonna get to see

335
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,550
you actually do it though you know

336
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:29,120
that's the thing

337
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:30,320
it's like i need her to see

338
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,400
that because i want i need her

339
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,710
to understand so as soon as we

340
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:34,940
can get her to theater you know

341
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:36,290
it's hard because her bedtime is right

342
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:37,490
around the time i go on stage

343
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:39,560
so um we'll just have to see

344
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,750
yeah that's that's definitely imminent yeah it

345
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:44,660
isn't i do think about the both

346
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:45,770
of you of like how do you

347
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:47,840
explain what mommy and daddy does for

348
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,310
a living like you know i mean

349
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:50,870
it is weird how do you explain

350
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:52,940
what mommy and daddy is it's weird

351
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:55,070
because i think being an actor such

352
00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:57,350
a weird job for a person and

353
00:11:57,350 --> 00:12:00,410
podcast normal podcaster i don't think you

00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:14,150
tortoise constantly yeah you know many animals

514
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:15,080

565
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:04,910
i watched soap dish for the first

566
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:06,770
time i saw yeah that's right we've

567
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:08,240
talked to newbie i'm talking about me

568
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,255
on my new told me i should

569
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:13,070
watch some show yes so you guys

570
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:14,960
stand by it you gotta stop but

571
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:15,800
let me say this because i don't

572
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,390
think i said this before see eh

573
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:19,490
every scene is like one second too

574
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:21,200
long oh no you didn't wave the

575
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,322
wedge director that's so i'm sure everyone

576
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:24,950
knew a one thousand one and it

577
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:26,480
could have been cut off exactly yeah

578
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:29,210
it's all great people but the direction

579
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:31,760
of it sometimes because i'm sally field

580
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:34,760
who is great yeah sometimes is like

581
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:37,250

582
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:37,550
bag

583
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:39,290
good way because they didn't cut she

584
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:41,390
probably yeah because that's a good lesson

585
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:43,160
for actors like always do it won't

586
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:45,170
stay in at one second longer than

587
00:19:45,170 --> 00:19:46,580
you think you should but that's what

588
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:48,110
you shouldn't do because because it's in

589
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:49,640
there and use it said bailout one

590
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,140

in high school it was like such

705
00:23:37,205 --> 00:23:40,025
a close place it's a fucking fun

706
00:23:40,025 --> 00:23:43,055

707
00:23:43,055 --> 00:23:45,425
location was bought out by a huge

708
00:23:45,695 --> 00:23:48,185
um what's the word february

709
00:23:50,225 --> 00:23:52,295

718
00:24:08,255 --> 00:24:10,025
because it's so corporate now like that

719
00:24:10,025 --> 00:24:12,305

00:24:12,305 --> 00:24:14,735
of cops handle large thing and it

721
00:24:14,735 --> 00:24:15,215

don't mean like his barbershop the streets

727
00:24:27,155 --> 00:24:30,409
are all like people are christian people

728
00:24:30,485 --> 00:24:32,105
but i know when you stumble into

729
00:24:32,105 --> 00:24:33,815
an improv theater and then watch like

730
00:24:33,815 --> 00:24:35,585

00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:28,550
train but it was a bus now

938
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:30,440

940
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:33,290

941
00:31:33,290 --> 00:31:35,150
have a connecting you're just to train

942
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:36,680
to be an asshole no actually because

943
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,810
once i started talking i understood but

944
00:31:39,050 --> 00:31:39,620
yeah

945
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:42,050
yeah so we thought we were gonna

946
00:31:42,050 --> 00:31:43,730
get off one train and onto another

947
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,260
train but hey you get off there

948
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:46,490
like actually it's that bus over there

949
00:31:46,490 --> 00:31:47,960
you're like oh shit there's about ten

950
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,310
minutes before we got off the first

951
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:51,200
train someone looked at their ticket more

952
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:54,710
closely and said this says bus and

953
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:56,600
who bucked it well i don't want

954
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:57,980
to throw anyone under that bus that

955
00:31:57,980 --> 00:31:59,600
we took but it was the baker

956
00:31:59,930 --> 00:32:03,230
um so anyway ah so so we

957
00:32:03,230 --> 00:32:05,210
get on this bus it's it's and

958
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:06,170
and the bus ride was fine i

959
00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:08,330

00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:26,540
were it was better but it still

1223
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:27,920
was like a big day where it

1224
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,840
was like yeah i had to put

1225
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:31,250
on sunscreen and it would always get

1226
00:40:31,250 --> 00:40:32,720
my eyes and try

1227
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:36,830

1230
00:40:40,310 --> 00:40:42,110
one and enjoy yourself so it's like

1231
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:43,130
really we did it all the time

1232
00:40:43,130 --> 00:40:44,720
in the summer but here i'm like

1233
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:46,070
i you'd have to live by the

1234
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:48,200
beach too yeah exactly yeah for us

1235
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:49,550
if if you don't know california i'm

1236
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:50,960
sure you think that we all just

1237
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,820
live on the beach well of course

1238
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:53,900

and nuts but no it's such a

1243
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:01,460
pain it's so annoying i think when

1244
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:02,750

1245
00:41:02,750 --> 00:41:03,830

1248
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:08,810
beach on the west side and who

1249
00:41:08,810 --> 00:41:10,490
