the risk of you guys getting spankings

252
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:27,900

253
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,340

you got nothing to worry about by

259
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:41,040
the way we have speaking spanking you

260
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,650
you guys bought some stuff yeah well

261
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:45,750
here's the thing so i'm a dumb

262
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:46,260
and

263
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:48,870
i'm a dumb

264
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:52,320
oh you're a damn yeah you're saying

265
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:54,900
i'm a dom but oh i'm a

266
00:09:54,901 --> 00:09:58,140
dumb and my subs love when i

267
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:00,300
buy the thing this way do i

268
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,530
have this relationship credit

269
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:07,180
okay so we both unbeknown to each

270
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:10,330
other acquired some spanking tools because if

271
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:12,430
if you're looking if you're just listening

272
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:14,830
to us for the first time ah

273
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:16,660
there's a rule on the show where

274
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:17,980
if you tell a story that you've

275
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:19,540
told on the show but on this

276
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:21,580
show not on other show another show

277
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,140
like the way i've been spang not

278
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:23,410
in line

279
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:25,090
life you get a spanking you get

280
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:26,650
a spanking if you repeat a story

281
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,870
on freedom and honestly i don't know

282
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:30,790
if we've ever had a justified spanking

283
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:32,947
we have believe spanked a bunch yes

284
00:10:32,947 --> 00:10:35,320
so none of them were correct we

285
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,570
still haven't exactly nailed down when you

286
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:39,310
get one yes there is no justice

287
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:40,600
but there's no waste as the way

288
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,876
the spanx spankings i didn't administer

289
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,520
the way the spanks of minister by

290
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:47,770
kevin are i don't know why the

291
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:49,300
board you did that voice weird i

292
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:51,070
imagined you like with your on your

293
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:52,630
knees with your shoes do your knees

294
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:57,640
like dorothy yeah dorm style door style

295
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,443
do you know dorfler no it's okay

296
00:10:59,443 --> 00:11:00,580
if you don't know what her foot

297
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:03,940
infection but opin in it okay that

298
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:05,560
might be by the way yeah um

299
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:06,880
so look up dorf by the way

300
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,280
kevin didn't want to touch anybody and

301
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,600
of course of course he doesn't want

302
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,430
to touch so read rather than you

303
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:13,567
extra anus right

304
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:16,510
all mr baines were baboons rather than

305
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:19,390
uses open hand he took a sharpie

306
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,550
and he would give a spanking light

307
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,530
tap a slight tap yes and we

308
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:25,180
realised well that's an inefficient spank it's

309
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:27,482
inefficient that's not that's not preventative it's

310
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:29,080
spanking we like to do much

311
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:36,100
so lauren but this little hand this

312
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:37,990

and these were labeled as trump hands

314
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:42,580
which to me not funny over done

315
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:44,680
we get it but but i always

316
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:47,200
as rude as a sharpie hand if

317
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,090
it's perfectly a sharpie to become a

318
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:50,290
spanking sharpie uh

319
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,300

i also like to say i think

355
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,840
we should put in the news studio

356
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,760
a hook on the wall where we

357
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,467
hang that yes absolutely seven yeah and

358
00:13:30,814 --> 00:13:32,050
maybe a little plaque over it yeah

359
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:33,550
and it should be shaped like explains

360
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:35,470
what it be shaped like captain hook

361
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:36,880
and maybe the hook is captain hook's

362
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,650
nose okay yes in the hooky shape

363
00:13:38,659 --> 00:13:40,630
like hacks captain hook's nose yeah and

364
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:41,800
coming back to it is like a

365
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:42,370
cactus hook

366
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:45,400

368
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:48,880

369
00:13:49,534 --> 00:13:53,710
no no no yeah of course we

370
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:55,690
know it's coming off the nose we

371
00:13:55,690 --> 00:13:58,029

handbag itself it's heavy yeah hey use

447
00:16:36,151 --> 00:16:37,622
the hand but what i think it's

448
00:16:37,622 --> 00:16:38,770
a chevy yeah i think is good

449
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:41,350
about the flatwater is it provides more

450
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:43,270
distance yeah i think it's i think

451
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:45,280
it's more appropriate it has holes in

452
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,990
it so you can really build up

453
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:49,660
some speed with it yeah yeah i

454
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:49,810
think

455
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:52,000
yeah i think it's fair you think

456
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,670

a regular old foam thing that you

you wouldn't lose some thing you know

520
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:10,480

have to come to terms with this

681
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:04,330
because i don't know it's it is

682
00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:05,800
weird and i feel like i avoid

683
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,660
posting anything where my feet are shown

684
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:09,370

oh that's sucks

686
00:25:10,677 --> 00:25:13,630
you think about that it's weird but

687
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:15,280

00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:28,630
not used to being sexualized but also

693
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:30,790
it's like fine because i don't

694
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:32,920

00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:00,670
in australia it's an mmo and i

763
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:02,110

764
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:04,060
picture and it said ostrich yeah bitch

765
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:06,520
and an ostrich beach isn't a hijack

766
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:06,970
at the big

767
00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:10,390
rocks in my head tragic this isn't

768
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:11,230
ulcers

769
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:14,440
but i loved that experience would you

770
00:28:14,842 --> 00:28:16,480
go feed kangaroos who were like right

771
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,650
next to us and stand next to

772
00:28:17,650 --> 00:28:19,450
them i was a little freaked out

773
00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:21,490
by the kangaroos because you you walk

774
00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:22,777
into this like and those we dug

775
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:24,610
about eggs the jump only limit they

776
00:28:24,610 --> 00:28:26,020
were all injured by like cars and

777
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:28,297
stuff yeah these were at these animals

778
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:29,438
at the scene they all had tired

779
00:28:29,438 --> 00:28:31,300
tracks yeah

780
00:28:32,770 --> 00:28:34,990
they were all on crutches the big

781
00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:38,080
bandages but yeah that being so close

782
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,270
to them was kind of weird to

783
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:42,970
me even though obviously they're around people

784
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,440
all the time like this is their

785
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,210
gig now it's like they hang array

786
00:28:46,270 --> 00:28:47,290
and you can walk right up to

787
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:48,880
them but it still felt like i

788
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:51,310
guess because they'd never been that close

789
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:52,510
to this

790
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:54,130
animal yeah that's like i don't know

791
00:28:54,130 --> 00:28:55,840
what he's gonna do that's how desensitized

792
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,100
to it i became of like oh

793
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:58,390
i guess it's cool just to be

794
00:28:58,390 --> 00:28:59,800
around these animals that when i went

795
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,540
over to the ostrich it was like

796
00:29:01,570 --> 00:29:03,130
yeah it's obviously safe to be next

797
00:29:03,130 --> 00:29:04,500
to this ostrich and then pick me

798
00:29:04,549 --> 00:29:06,940

799
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:08,410
a fence to get his picture taken

800
00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:10,360

should stop it's called monologue thief and

1179
00:42:27,445 --> 00:42:29,065
the way it works is somebody starts

1180
00:42:29,215 --> 00:42:30,625
doing a monologue it can be in

1181
00:42:30,625 --> 00:42:32,455

for the longest time

1306
00:47:29,725 --> 00:47:33,325
time and it had the most depressing

1307
00:47:33,685 --> 00:47:37,555
like eighties font and it was just

1308
00:47:37,555 --> 00:47:39,085

only movie theater in but really yeah

1334
00:48:23,245 --> 00:48:26,095

1336
00:48:28,255 --> 00:48:30,175
here for you know twenty five years

1337
00:48:30,235 --> 00:48:31,855
whatever so i've seen the trajectory of

1338
00:48:31,855 --> 00:48:33,805
it it was like the only movie

1339
00:48:33,805 --> 00:48:35,755
theater was there you had to go

1340
00:48:35,755 --> 00:48:37,585
to it i believe i saw sigourney

1341
00:48:37,585 --> 00:48:39,805
matters yeah it was a cool like

1342
00:48:39,805 --> 00:48:41,335
the yeah the mall was it had

1343
00:48:41,365 --> 00:48:42,805
it had it has this like train

1344
00:48:42,805 --> 00:48:44,065
down on the bottom floor and all

1345
00:48:44,065 --> 00:48:46,405
this stuff and then they built other

1346
00:48:46,405 --> 00:48:49,075
movie theaters around and they built up

1347
00:48:49,075 --> 00:48:50,365
the entire area and now

1348
00:48:50,395 --> 00:48:52,345
nothing is there and every other stores

1349
00:48:52,345 --> 00:48:54,385
closed every store is a weird name

1350
00:48:54,385 --> 00:48:55,820
that looks fake like i want to

1351
00:48:55,820 --> 00:48:56,905
take a picture of everyone when i

1352
00:48:56,905 --> 00:48:58,435
