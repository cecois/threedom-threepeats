00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:33,030
yeah and it had to be someone

13
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:34,200
that we cared it couldn't just be

14
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,290

yeah did you ever care about any

17
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,260
of the humans on i care deeply

18
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:44,790
about mr cooper you know i think

19
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:45,660
small businessman

20
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,810
i pulled himself up by his bootstraps

21
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:50,220
i didn't care in the moment but

22
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:51,839
then when they've passed now i feel

23
00:00:51,839 --> 00:00:53,310
when they pass it's like or bob

24
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:55,650

you don't want to see those idiots

26
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:58,470

00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:00,510
is that they have grover hunting sesame

do you think anyone will but after

127
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,660
the strike is over yeah do you

128
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,160
think the one i've hit my pitch

129
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,590
for shelter lee where it's it's open

130
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:51,210
and nursing i think they should do

131
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:53,520
across over with young sheldon and ghosts

132
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:55,320
and then once you've killed off young

133
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,780
sheldon from your vihar track team he's

134
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:58,470
he's

135
00:04:58,573 --> 00:05:00,450
i'd go so any they all have

136
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:04,110
their oil embargoes yea all it goes

137
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,710
they all oh wow let's go sta

138
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:12,000
i like it ideal solution because the

139
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,140
actor still get work that's what i

140
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:15,090
was concerned about yeah i was concerned

141
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:16,710
the actors getting fired and i think

142
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:18,030
a shame if they found out about

143
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:19,500
your button they would try to kill

144
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,360
you because you're like putting their jobs

145
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,330
in jeopardy damn the rich why anyone

146
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:27,120

147
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,560

220
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,890
janey asked what the weather was going

221
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:06,510
to be like she tells you the

222
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:08,040
weather and said oh by the way

223
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:10,530
if you wanna know this yeah yeah

224
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,480
it's obviously what's testing shit and so

00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:13,890
we're like yeah okay let's hear it

226
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:15,450

227
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:17,160
you can get this app it's like

228
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,010
hey no yeah that's well so what

229
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:21,540
i read like that when an app

230
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:24,720
alexis in trouble because they're having trouble

231
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,090
monetizing anything that anyone ever asks it

232
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:30,270
and that and because because what it

233
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:31,920
is yes exactly because people are just

234
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,620
saying hey what's the weather yeah and

235
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:36,390
there's no way to monetize that that's

236
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:38,070
why it's always suggesting things like hey

237
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:39,480
if you want to know this yeah

238
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,850

00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:58,080
we're here now well let's deal with

332
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:01,320
it but she's like she's like i

333
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,160
don't know if i can go to

334
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,050
the movie i'm like this is the

335
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,570
perfect time for you to be high

336
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,370

decks like

339
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:12,360
just let's just enjoy it and then

340
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:13,881
she got into the right mindset and

341
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:16,080
it was just great okay that's that's

342
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:17,730
that's scary though when you don't expect

343
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:18,870
it yeah you have any more than

344
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:22,260
yeah i was weird chatting about there's

345
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:23,640
a lot of people are doing this

346
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:26,160
yes yes yes yeah i'm curious you

347
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,740
know yeah i'm weirdly not that curious

348
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:30,240
about it i'm not that curious i

349
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:30,840
know what it feels like

350
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:31,920
to be stone i know what it

351
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,270
feels like to be sort of sound

352
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,980
and i think i get what that

353
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:36,000
would feel like i think i could

354
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,040
see how they'd be great um so

355
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,750
i'm going just thinking now and i'm

356
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:40,320
doing it forever

357
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:42,570
yeah but i just i don't i'm

358
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:44,250
not i wouldn't say i'm like what's

359
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:46,020
that like it's more that i'm just

360
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:48,059
kind of like alright look more like

361
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:49,740
really nice people like if you're not

362
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:51,420
stoned to take your moods a little

363
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:53,580
bit better it's like yeah that's being

364
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:55,770
stoned or you just also popping the

365
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:58,560
anti depressants because they probably pymol my

366
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,990
head hurts those touches know you are

367
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:03,360
pushing up imagining because oh that's because

368
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,800
i was touching my head so i

369
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,940

cleaning chimneys constantly um on the news

388
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:45,750
when they would talk

389
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:49,710
about politicians and stuff they would so

390
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:52,020
often talk about their body language or

391
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:53,190
heal but if so they have like

392
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:54,720
a body language person they're saying but

393
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,590

a couple times and people are like

397
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:01,710
and people dismiss it there's always like

398
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:02,850
a reaction to it it's like the

399
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,550
fucking yeah like it's like vaccines and

400
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:05,910

405
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:22,590

um

787
00:29:21,455 --> 00:29:25,175
consciousness that was in this round this

788
00:29:25,175 --> 00:29:26,435
is the future liberals want

789
00:29:27,965 --> 00:29:28,805
you know what i would mind it

790
00:29:30,095 --> 00:29:31,775
to be a consciousness i wanna be

791
00:29:31,775 --> 00:29:34,689
a consciousness in the ether abu dhabi

792
00:29:34,689 --> 00:29:36,245

dvd is actually cooler than i remember

798
00:29:48,725 --> 00:29:50,645

him just say he just saint but

800
00:29:52,145 --> 00:29:53,825
it actually sounds like it's it's it's

801
00:29:53,825 --> 00:29:55,715
including yeah yeah trying to think of

803
00:29:57,455 --> 00:29:59,495

cruise if he had an australian accent

921
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:20,030

00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:20,900
someone which should raise nets so she

987
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:22,970

three years old

00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:36,380
because that is true i don't know

996
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:37,490

997
00:36:37,490 --> 00:36:39,800

she's ever done previous to three years

999
00:36:41,870 --> 00:36:43,640
she's three years old she's very sophisticated

1000
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:45,350
i'll say that she's got to be

1001
00:36:45,350 --> 00:36:47,360
in the top percentile yeah she wears

1002
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:49,190
a gown very comfortably for someone who's

1003
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:51,973
three ah she's a little too comfortable

1004
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:52,820
a gown

1005
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:54,830
and for three year old usb yeah

1006
00:36:55,435 --> 00:36:58,610
and those heels all the original yields

1007
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,170

1008
00:37:00,170 --> 00:37:02,840

and next thing you know everybody got

1014
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,770
low but i think she really has

1015
00:37:15,770 --> 00:37:17,547
that way of inspiring people she really

1016
00:37:17,547 --> 00:37:19,460
ah we love you nicole i don't

1018
00:37:21,170 --> 00:37:23,570
but the other day ah we were

1019
00:37:23,570 --> 00:37:25,160

1020
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:28,100
about the beverly hillbillies and ah it

1021
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:29,150
struck me that

1022
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:33,050
granny um in the opening credits being

1023
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:34,580
in a rocking chair on top of

1024
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:36,650
their old truck on top huh it's

1025
00:37:36,650 --> 00:37:38,720
actually pretty funny it is funny yeah

1026
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,370
although is it based ah is it

1027
00:37:40,370 --> 00:37:41,960
based on the grapes of wrath where

1028
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,730
she was just on it i think

1029
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:46,280
it's an heightening of that yes okay

1030
00:37:46,310 --> 00:37:48,050
yes she's rocking chair rather than a

1031
00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:50,288
chair chair yeah yeah yeah that's

1032
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:51,740

1033
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:53,660
the truck she's on she's on the

1034

a pitch that might be done we've

1111
00:40:58,625 --> 00:40:59,765

1112
00:40:59,855 --> 00:41:02,165
we've done shows like that before so

1113
00:41:02,165 --> 00:41:04,055

1114
00:41:04,055 --> 00:41:06,545
the with the actual title of the

1115
00:41:06,545 --> 00:41:08,255
real thing yeah that's the person who's

1116
00:41:08,255 --> 00:41:09,725
being pitched to yes so you give

1117
00:41:09,725 --> 00:41:12,785

1118
00:41:12,815 --> 00:41:14,045

1119
00:41:14,645 --> 00:41:17,075

stay silent to take whatever it is

1125
00:41:27,695 --> 00:41:28,685
and they have to incorporate it into

1126
00:41:28,685 --> 00:41:31,505
