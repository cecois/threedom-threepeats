yeah they put it on but it

105
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,240

106
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,830
lot of overlap with both of those

107
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:07,320
um and but it was it was

108
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:10,590
my first experience with um they're one

109
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:12,450
of the guys in the show they

110
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:14,130
thought was acting out so they

111
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:15,960
asked him to stay after a rehearsal

112
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,340
and then they all laid hands on

113
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,170
him and prayed over hey wait

114
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:25,140
they panned him because he was being

115
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:27,990
rambunctious yeah he was these were catholics

116
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:29,880
these are catholics yeah wow it was

117
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,741
strange i think there was i think

118
00:04:31,741 --> 00:04:33,210
it was the catholic diocese was putting

119
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:34,560
it on but then there were christians

00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,650
involved rose but i'd never seen nor

126
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,310

worry i wish i'd been there that's

136
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,030
what i've used a time machine for

137
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:07,980
to go back and help that guy

138
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:09,630
it was the first time i'd ever

139
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:11,520
heard of a camel toe because you

140
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:11,970
saw him

141
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:17,250
because we we one of the teachers

142
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:19,560
ah who was directing the player helping

143
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,730

144
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:22,500
one one day never got and everyone

145
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,630
was like a woman yeah and so

146
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:26,730
it became a chuckle otherwise it became

147
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:28,500
a catchphrase of check out the sketch

148
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,300
check out the cd on the teach

149
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,820
became like a thing we would say

150
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,000
now the first time you heard it

151
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,650
did you say what does that mean

152
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:39,060
or did you pretend you already knew

153
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:40,020

253
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,690
i i saw ben platt on the

254
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:17,070

255
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:18,480

256
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:20,370
like hamilton though we're young and get

257
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:21,540
a sense of what the story know

258
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:23,550
so i don't really i've pieced together

259
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:24,660
some parts of the story but i

260
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:26,490
don't really know but the songs are

261
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:28,410
so good anyway because i was told

262
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:29,580
don't listen to it without seeing it

263
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:30,900
but then i just was like i

264
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,940
just wanna know and i would say

265
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,200
you can listen to without seeing it

266
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:35,400
this is what you want to talk

267
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,180
to us huh

268
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,890
i want first of all i think

269
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:39,060
the same but when you saw it

270
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:44,070
yeah right utah it's no it's amazing

271
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:45,870
i would i would it was to

272
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:47,310
the extent that we didn't know who

273
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:49,290
could replace him that's what i because

274
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:50,400
i thought once i missed him i

275
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,480
was like well no no when am

276
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,440
i gonna see it's gonna be so

277
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,630
long whatever and the music has made

278
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:56,520
me like cry so much without any

279
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:56,880
contests

280
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,950
like i would imagine that whoever replaced

281
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:00,180
him is great in it but ah

282
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:01,800
i'm sure i mean yeah of course

283
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:04,140
that's always singers are so impressive yeah

284
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:05,760
it's always the thing when a show

285
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,500
starts and then the person that originates

286
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,880
throws like well there's no point i

287
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,110
mean who's ever going to be as

288
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,520
good as rad but it's like these

289
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,590
things run forever and it's like of

290
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:15,090
course a bunch of great people are

291
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:17,040
gonna be there get somebody sting

292
00:10:17,655 --> 00:10:19,755
but it's the end i just i've

293
00:10:19,755 --> 00:10:21,735
never seen him anyone do what he

294
00:10:21,735 --> 00:10:23,835
does he's so amazing i've just heard

295
00:10:23,835 --> 00:10:25,515
him and random things should be like

296
00:10:25,545 --> 00:10:27,735
somersaults he splits his penis down the

297
00:10:27,735 --> 00:10:30,405
middle i got to see de um

298
00:10:30,555 --> 00:10:31,905

00:10:34,245 --> 00:10:35,715

301
00:10:36,105 --> 00:10:37,785

303
00:10:39,825 --> 00:10:40,785

her and she's also from one of

314
00:10:55,425 --> 00:10:57,105
my favorite movies of all time which

315
00:10:57,105 --> 00:10:58,695
is i didn't mention because i don't

316
00:10:58,815 --> 00:10:59,895
know how she would feel about it

317
00:10:59,895 --> 00:11:00,855
but my girl too

318
00:11:02,115 --> 00:11:05,025
girl was so i've never even seen

319
00:11:05,025 --> 00:11:06,195
when they go to l a when

320
00:11:06,195 --> 00:11:08,115
i was return of the bees i

321
00:11:08,115 --> 00:11:10,785
loved it because she goes to l

322
00:11:10,785 --> 00:11:11,925
a to try to learn about her

323
00:11:11,925 --> 00:11:14,655
dead mom this is clumsy yeah and

324
00:11:15,015 --> 00:11:16,455
it's just like a really cool seventy

325
00:11:16,455 --> 00:11:17,805
s l a vibe in the whole

326
00:11:17,805 --> 00:11:18,945
movie i just loved it so much

327
00:11:18,945 --> 00:11:21,825
and because you want to move to

328
00:11:21,885 --> 00:11:22,185
la

329
00:11:22,275 --> 00:11:23,021
i don't know i just thought it

330
00:11:23,021 --> 00:11:24,105
was really cool and like the music

331
00:11:24,105 --> 00:11:24,915
was so cool and i had the

332
00:11:24,915 --> 00:11:26,205
soundtrack and it was like when you

333
00:11:26,205 --> 00:11:28,305
moved to la what was it oh

334
00:11:28,305 --> 00:11:29,355
yeah this is what i thought it

335
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:30,495
would be from the movies or is

336
00:11:30,495 --> 00:11:33,105
um it was interesting because it was

337
00:11:33,105 --> 00:11:35,148
so i had never really been here

338
00:11:35,148 --> 00:11:38,445
i only visited one time and my

339
00:11:38,475 --> 00:11:40,545
perception of it was so based on

340
00:11:40,545 --> 00:11:42,315
like tv and movies and i

341
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:43,695
just even like living in a warm

342
00:11:43,695 --> 00:11:45,855
climate was weird to me and i

343
00:11:45,855 --> 00:11:47,055
think it's really weird when you see

344
00:11:47,055 --> 00:11:48,855
something in the movies that pretends like

345
00:11:48,855 --> 00:11:49,875
all of l a is in the

346
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,885
same spot like right i just watched

347
00:11:51,885 --> 00:11:53,235
something in their data was like new

348
00:11:53,235 --> 00:11:54,225
or i'm like they're pretending to just

349
00:11:54,225 --> 00:11:55,790
get from venice yeah for like even

350
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:57,885
on like a football game if it's

351
00:11:57,945 --> 00:11:59,685
if it's downtown at the coliseum or

352
00:11:59,685 --> 00:12:01,935
whatever they'll they'll coming back from a

353
00:12:01,935 --> 00:12:02,505
commercial show

354
00:12:02,505 --> 00:12:04,215
show like the santa monica pier like

355
00:12:04,215 --> 00:12:05,565
we're here in l a it's like

356
00:12:05,565 --> 00:12:07,815
that is out an hour away money

357
00:12:07,845 --> 00:12:09,015
like when i watch a football game

358
00:12:09,825 --> 00:12:11,535
this is what tv does is like

359
00:12:11,835 --> 00:12:13,935
so there they start one goalpost and

360
00:12:13,935 --> 00:12:15,405
then they act like the other goalpost

361
00:12:15,435 --> 00:12:17,685
is just like the distance of a

362
00:12:17,685 --> 00:12:19,635
football field away yeah it's like so

363
00:12:19,635 --> 00:12:20,958
much further i used to live in

364
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:22,665
a football field yeah and so

365
00:12:22,755 --> 00:12:25,738
how was that it was cold drafty

366
00:12:26,055 --> 00:12:28,875
draftee especially because teen lot of times

367
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:30,915

560
00:18:45,315 --> 00:18:46,995

00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:10,080
the pennies that nobody deposits and then

632
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,880
they get more money from the superman

633
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:14,820

00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,720
a half just to dry

740
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,270
dry my hair when was not knows

741
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:34,770
that he was blowing on it he

742
00:24:34,770 --> 00:24:37,530
was like standing now pulling at oxfam

743
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:40,170
night cares like always surprisingly thick to

744
00:24:40,170 --> 00:24:41,580
the people doing otherwise like oh it's

745
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:42,690
more hair than i thought was gonna

746
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:44,040
be but so it takes a little

747
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,420
longer anything but it was almost like

748
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:47,130
he had never dealt with that in

749
00:24:47,130 --> 00:24:47,730
his life

750
00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:50,580
just like he was saying like going

751
00:24:50,610 --> 00:24:52,036
through each piece and to the point

752
00:24:52,078 --> 00:24:54,240
i started like panning zombie late and

753
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,010
i eventually was like how much longer

754
00:24:56,010 --> 00:24:56,970
it's gonna be and he's like five

755
00:24:56,970 --> 00:24:58,410
minutes nothing visits like suddenly done i

756
00:24:58,410 --> 00:25:00,540
was like i'd been there for so

757
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:02,490
long it was driving me crazy and

758
00:25:02,490 --> 00:25:03,540
i didn't want to ask any well

759
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:05,572
yeah i mean because it's the rudest

760
00:25:05,572 --> 00:25:07,710
question like are you sure i've been

761
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:09,060
here so many times it's never

762
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,827
taken have you ever done a pair

763
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:12,150
and you're sure you know how to

764
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:13,440
do what you do benefit of this

765
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,850
place is that you go it's like

766
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,440
in and out you think this just

767
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,820
like that my favorite burger place yes

768
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,800
you think it was set you for

769
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:22,320
calling me yeah oh oh do you

770
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:23,430
think this is a catch me if

771
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:25,020
you can situation while he's trying to

772
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:27,270
fuck with me was the craziest pilot

773
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:29,099
monster he's an impostor

774
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,660
apply it you know could have been

775
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:33,480
like a jamie kennedy experiment type oh

776
00:25:33,505 --> 00:25:35,310
so with no payoff yeah yeah nobody

777
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:37,680
comes out the end you're not like

778
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,120
mad and they put like a bad

779
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,770
review online that happened to a friend

780
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:42,210
of mine she was part of a

781
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:43,710
prank show she got hired she was

782
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:46,170
is still an actress sort of but

783
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:49,353
um she she got hired to do

784
00:25:49,353 --> 00:25:49,440
a

785
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:52,650
prank show at an audition um so

786
00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:54,210
they set up a whole fake audition

787
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:55,650
for actors to come she knew what

788
00:25:55,650 --> 00:25:56,730
it was she knew what it was

789
00:25:56,730 --> 00:25:58,860
so she was hired to be annoying

790
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:00,810
in the audition room oh right so

791
00:26:00,810 --> 00:26:02,910
she she was doing all the stereotypical

792
00:26:02,910 --> 00:26:05,250
like annoying actor things that people do

793
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:08,340
and in this in this room and

794
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:09,600
then the trouble was

795
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,850
was they they never ended up airing

796
00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:13,950
the show they never told the people

797
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:16,230
involved that it was a fake oh

798
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:18,300
audition for a prank shows so she

799
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:21,180
would see them at auditions for years

800
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:23,820
after that and people would alienate her

801
00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:24,990
to the point where she would go

802
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:27,000
up to people and say hey i

803
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,700

i was part of this web series

824

for fox that never aired but it

825
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:14,940
was like one of my first jobs

826
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:16,350
here and was really exciting and a

827
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:17,490
lot of great people were like thomas

828
00:27:17,490 --> 00:27:20,125
mildish and um brendan johnson and it

829
00:27:20,125 --> 00:27:21,600

evan jackson was in it and we

831
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:25,680
were like the best time and then

832
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,390
we had to do this thing where

833
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:28,740
we would go we're supposed to be

834
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:30,240
like people who worked at fox wearing

835
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:31,320
competent that was kind of like the

836
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:34,230
idea and we had to go to

837
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:37,050
like the tcas and do interviews with

838
00:27:37,050 --> 00:27:37,950
people like when they were doing the

839
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:41,730
press circuit and be like characters asking

840
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:44,160
them dumb stuff for like part of

841
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,950
the web series so factors like interviewing

842
00:27:47,010 --> 00:27:48,900
them like we already like your entertainment

843
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:50,370

844
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,960
like you work for but they knew

845
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,970
that they knew what we were doing

846
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,500
and but then like we had to

847
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:56,370
you know what i mean it's it

848
00:27:56,370 --> 00:27:57,480
was because they were in on it

849
00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:59,790
the failure early early early and they

850
00:27:59,790 --> 00:28:01,650
didn't all love it you know people

851
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,090
yes it's a waste of time which

852
00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:04,110
of course it was special because you

853
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:07,290
never saw it um and i remember

854
00:28:07,290 --> 00:28:08,760
entering everyone on all the new shows

855
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,170
on fox and it was just so

856
00:28:10,170 --> 00:28:10,560
it was one of those

857
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:12,060
these days where you interview the simpsons

858
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:14,850

out on hollywood boulevard and the the

879
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,860
the game of it was that we

880
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:00,450
had a long list of questions that

881
00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:03,870
we would ask people ah questions like

00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:23,910
yeah like i didn't say anything i

924
00:30:23,910 --> 00:30:24,990
don't know how i knew not to

925
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:26,790
and then the director counties like the

926
00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:29,040
the the companies in the van and

927
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,210
they can hear you and everything you

928
00:30:30,210 --> 00:30:31,170
said they just heard you say it

929
00:30:31,170 --> 00:30:31,590

did they keep him on yeah so

934
00:30:40,025 --> 00:30:41,675
hard to roll record and then we

935
00:30:41,705 --> 00:30:43,415

936
00:30:43,415 --> 00:30:46,355

it wouldn't be it was the most

1157
00:38:32,645 --> 00:38:34,715
bigot it was the most obviously in

1158
00:38:34,715 --> 00:38:36,455
their bones the table

1159
00:38:38,465 --> 00:38:40,655
it was a white motor split it

1160
00:38:40,655 --> 00:38:43,445
was the most overtly sexual they ever

1161
00:38:43,445 --> 00:38:44,945
got on that show and even if

1162
00:38:44,945 --> 00:38:46,025
you look at it now you're like

1163
00:38:46,265 --> 00:38:49,085
yeah okay it's not like i'm fairly

1164
00:38:49,085 --> 00:38:50,625
modest i've seen some of that shit

1165
00:38:50,625 --> 00:38:52,175
yeah but it but at the time

1166
00:38:52,205 --> 00:38:53,225
i mean this is why they would

1167
00:38:53,225 --> 00:38:55,565
cover table legs oh yeah because you

1168
00:38:55,565 --> 00:38:57,065
would go insane yeah fuck a table

1169
00:38:57,095 --> 00:38:57,785
right why does you

1170
00:38:57,815 --> 00:38:59,705
just never at the time you would

1171
00:38:59,705 --> 00:39:02,165
never see anything any skin on tv

1172
00:39:02,165 --> 00:39:03,575
so to see it in the victorian

1173
00:39:03,575 --> 00:39:07,385
era they used to cover table legs

1174
00:39:07,415 --> 00:39:09,665
with likely they will be like carved

1175
00:39:09,665 --> 00:39:11,285
you know so intricately and it looked

1176
00:39:11,315 --> 00:39:12,815
at that says you'll do suggest you

1177
00:39:12,845 --> 00:39:14,225

1240
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:18,980
cold

1241
00:41:20,660 --> 00:41:22,040

1476
00:49:44,390 --> 00:49:48,680

1479
00:49:55,370 --> 00:49:58,370

few apartments and this one guy a

1484
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:07,610
lot of times i think he would

1485
00:50:07,610 --> 00:50:10,040
either fall asleep with his tv on

1486
00:50:10,220 --> 00:50:11,930
or he would leave the house with

1487
00:50:11,930 --> 00:50:14,390
his tv on for solo or something

1488
00:50:14,630 --> 00:50:16,760

1551
00:52:27,170 --> 00:52:28,580

yeah i need to get this in

1616
00:54:20,270 --> 00:54:23,270
this is the story about um we

1617
00:54:23,270 --> 00:54:25,820
had when janey and i lived in

1618
00:54:25,820 --> 00:54:28,640
los felix we had these neighbors across

1619
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:31,730
the street that um had moved in

1620
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:32,840
you know that we've been living there

1621
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:33,830
like a couple of years and they

1622
00:54:33,860 --> 00:54:34,790
moved in and it was like this

1623
00:54:34,790 --> 00:54:38,630
young couple and they would have not

1624
00:54:38,630 --> 00:54:38,750
pay

1625
00:54:38,750 --> 00:54:40,760
parties but they would have like another

1626
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:43,010
couple over their house parties and they

1627
00:54:43,370 --> 00:54:45,920
was sorry that's my old roommate that

1628
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:47,420
was okay let's get into that because

1629
00:54:47,420 --> 00:54:49,280
i said so i joke from your

1630
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:52,040
old remains so we they would what

1631
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:53,420
they would do was when they were

1632
00:54:53,420 --> 00:54:54,080
hanging out

1633
00:54:55,370 --> 00:54:57,530
they would keep their front door open

1634
00:54:57,530 --> 00:54:58,850
because they'd like go out and smoke

1635
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:00,470
on their porch or whatever and they'd

1636
00:55:00,470 --> 00:55:03,260
be blaring their music and they would

1637
00:55:03,260 --> 00:55:04,280
blair it so they could hear it

1638
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:06,170
outside when they would go outside and

1639
00:55:06,170 --> 00:55:10,100
so i was now being the guy

1640
00:55:10,100 --> 00:55:12,410
who's going across street in his pajamas

1641
00:55:12,410 --> 00:55:14,390
saying because you could you just close

1642
00:55:14,390 --> 00:55:15,260
your door you don't have to turn

1643
00:55:15,260 --> 00:55:15,440
these

1644
00:55:15,620 --> 00:55:17,120
but just close the new app in

1645
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:19,250
the back yeah i went out there

1646
00:55:19,250 --> 00:55:20,870
in a red union suit i of

1647
00:55:20,870 --> 00:55:22,520
course i had my cowboy house in

1648
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:24,590
yeah with lab open i found that

1649
00:55:24,590 --> 00:55:26,739
out later of course but i went

1650
00:55:26,739 --> 00:55:28,220
they were all laughing and they were

1651
00:55:28,250 --> 00:55:30,050
they were always really nice and they

1652
00:55:30,050 --> 00:55:31,820
would close the door and it happened

1653
00:55:31,832 --> 00:55:33,170
so many times that eventually i was

1654
00:55:33,170 --> 00:55:34,670
like i there has to be some

1655
00:55:34,670 --> 00:55:35,600
other way to prevent this

1656
00:55:35,630 --> 00:55:37,130
from happening right now to keep being

1657
00:55:37,130 --> 00:55:39,110
the person yeah and and also so

1658
00:55:39,110 --> 00:55:40,820
they don't keep doing it so i

1659
00:55:41,900 --> 00:55:43,550
this all of a sudden just occurred

1660
00:55:43,550 --> 00:55:46,490
to me i'm going to brett i'm

1661
00:55:46,490 --> 00:55:48,170

1664
00:55:53,660 --> 00:55:55,850

keep your door closed wow music and

1666
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:00,050

1669
00:56:02,030 --> 00:56:03,530
that wasn't a good idea and then

1670
00:56:03,530 --> 00:56:05,300
they eventually wrote me back and said

1671
00:56:05,570 --> 00:56:07,100

1682
00:56:26,576 --> 00:56:28,700
satisfying i dare to say and it

1683
00:56:28,700 --> 00:56:31,458
gets results as much as i i

1684
00:56:31,566 --> 00:56:33,080
it stresses me out to think of

1685
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:35,810
yelling at someone the i'm so proud

1686
00:56:35,810 --> 00:56:37,460
of myself when i do it like

1687
00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:38,810
when it's dessert when you stand up

1688
00:56:38,810 --> 00:56:40,910
for yourself like yes i don't care

1689
00:56:40,910 --> 00:56:42,350
about this absolutely yeah

1690
00:56:42,350 --> 00:56:43,430
yeah i don't like it i always

1691
00:56:43,430 --> 00:56:45,410
think to myself i should de-escalate the

1692
00:56:45,410 --> 00:56:47,780
situation well then i spent the rest

1693
00:56:47,780 --> 00:56:48,770
of the time i living i was

1694
00:56:48,770 --> 00:56:50,360
living there thinking that she hated me

1695
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:51,650
in the all the neighbors bonded with

1696
00:56:51,650 --> 00:56:53,390
her and they all hated me because

1697
00:56:53,390 --> 00:56:54,530
like they would be talking in the

1698
00:56:54,530 --> 00:56:55,942

00:57:00,230 --> 00:57:01,340
never be the person who'd be out
