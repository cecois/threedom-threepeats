00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:26,090
it up feel it and tied up

374
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:27,860
the bag and then went outside to

375
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:29,510
our dumpster put it in the dumpster

376
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:31,580
make you really feel like this zero

377
00:13:33,206 --> 00:13:35,034
like a loaf of bread he's laughing

378
00:13:35,034 --> 00:13:37,310
because i'm holding up my hands just

379
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:39,882
in normal rats or normal right-sized yes

380
00:13:39,882 --> 00:13:41,630
about that yeah that's crazy from tip

381
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:43,370
to taint it was mainly about yeah

382
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:44,690
and they had a tale of course

383
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:46,100
but this i'm just measuring it's taint

384
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:46,370
here

385
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:49,790
yeah it was big it was and

386
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:51,170
i never saw another rat again i

387
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:52,640
don't know why that was your life

388
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,080
in my thought was the only route

389
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,640
i've ever seen oh my god wait

390
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:57,800
two things one place i was living

391
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,870
in la in my backyard i had

392
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:01,490
an orange tree and then i started

393
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:03,530
noticing that the orange peels would be

394
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:05,420
on the ground like fully formed but

395
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:06,920
without an orange inside like like a

396
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:07,430
row

397
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:09,354
feel like there'd be a whole like

398
00:14:09,357 --> 00:14:10,550
a magic trick yeah and i was

399
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:12,680
like well what's eat nose and then

400
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,840
i one time was out there and

401
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,160
i was face to face with a

402
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,420
rat that was on the tree and

403
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:19,040
there i learned that their thing called

404
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,810
tree rats which is really just rats

405
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,550
oh yeah they would like to be

406
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:24,320
intrigued and they like citrus and so

407
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,600
they love orange trees yeah and then

408
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,740
like these guys came in like chop

409
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:29,360
on every branch of my tree and

410
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,440
then like they just kept coming back

411
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,790
it was discussing oh we have a

412
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:33,290

413
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,690

514
00:17:57,770 --> 00:17:59,180
the only time i'd ever had ants

515
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:00,260
in the old place we just never

516
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:00,620
had it

517
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:01,670
so i was like if this is

518
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:03,530
what this place is like i cannot

519
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:05,300
live here but we found a really

520
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:07,460
great ah person who came in took

521
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:08,630
a look around and was like oh

522
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:10,340
yeah we can do this and within

523
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:11,870
a day just and he was like

524
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:14,030
it guarantees for two years he's like

525
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:15,170
you'll never see another aunt in here

526
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:17,060
for two years and it's humane with

527
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:18,050
pads and all that it was great

528
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:20,330
and then two years later years later

529
00:18:20,784 --> 00:18:22,040
thought we did call them back because

530
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,750
suddenly i in our bathroom there were

531
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:24,980
a few ants i was like i

532
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:26,930
haven't seen anson here for like hours

533
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:29,060
and sure enough yeah but that's so

534
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:30,950
those guys who i mean exterminators are

535
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:32,780
like so impressive i think they were

536
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:34,160
just like cron under the house and

537
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,660
like they're going right and they bring

538
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:37,100
out oh and this other part of

539
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,330
the story with the when the reds

540
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:40,100
went through the wall they pulled out

541
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:40,850
a bunch of dead

542
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:44,270
ones and live ones from oh sh

543
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:46,220
and the guy crawled under the house

544
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:47,960
and then was like collecting them and

545
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,090
he's just cool isn't xl yes that's

546
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:51,680
holding us back well he had a

547
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:54,023
whole body suit oh yeah and he's

548
00:18:54,023 --> 00:18:55,610
like and then they all came out

549
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:57,530
he was like he just came out

550
00:18:57,530 --> 00:18:58,820

551
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:00,800

554
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:04,940
moving back yeah

555
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:06,590
oh they were dead i think actually

556
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:07,850
all because they come at nights they

lucy as a fucking personality yes i

729
00:24:58,370 --> 00:25:00,260
guess so like a little initial i

730
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:01,430
just feel like all these guys have

731
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:03,350
no interests or anything like they're all

732
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:06,440
just like so boring getting ah yeah

733
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:09,920
i've that two years is the bachelor

734
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:12,710
the thing about watching those shows reality

735
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:13,460
shows whatever

736
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:16,130
is that the people themselves i don't

737
00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:19,010
find interesting yeah and the the most

738
00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:21,770
interesting person on southern charm is somebody

739
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:22,880
who i think was supposed to be

740
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,320

calendar's we used to be able to

836
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,610
do whatever we want it was the

837
00:28:37,610 --> 00:28:39,770
craziest i it was my first guess

838
00:28:39,770 --> 00:28:40,970
was like you were taking home a

839
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:42,590
crate of pies a shift yeah i

840
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:44,420
was taking over the lines around each

841
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:45,350
other no

842
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,670
they like managers would disappear with girls

843
00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:51,830
in the private rooms and make out

844
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:53,960
with them some managers would put up

845
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:55,670
with like we would stay there till

846
00:28:55,670 --> 00:28:57,560
five in the morning drinking debris it

847
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,000
would put up a champagne room

848
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:01,910
that seems strange but they had you

849
00:29:01,910 --> 00:29:03,200
know those like off the beaten path

850
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,820
rooms that would have a curtain sometimes

851
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:07,340
where if you want dinner whatever you

852
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:09,290
wanted to kill somebody yeah so like

853
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:11,210
managers would put torn on the big

854
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:14,390
screen go on what yeah like if

855
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:16,310
like they would close the bar they

856
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:19,310
would put on a porn wow watch

857
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:20,090
a porn

858
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:22,190
oh it's so crazy it's not a

859
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:24,200
group it's not a game activity oh

860
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:26,120

tell you the adolf hitler thing

879
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:00,680
what oh what did he do now

880
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:04,940
doing something with this guy now we

881
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:06,050
have these we have these things that

882
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,630
marie calendar's where we they had the

883
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:11,566
muscular dystrophy association i think like have

884
00:30:11,566 --> 00:30:13,540
these shamrocks that you could buy for

885
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:15,230
dollars put your name on it and

886
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:16,700
it was to raise money for early

887
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:19,610
and so and we posted them all

888
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:21,673
around the restaurants i think i know

889
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:25,220
so we went up that said from

890
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:26,480
the wonderful heart of ada

891
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:30,310
we just put it up in the

892
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:34,270
middle of these things and everyone's in

893
00:30:34,270 --> 00:30:37,240
a rare while someone would see it

894
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:39,280
should come over and say like look

895
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:41,710
what is up there with adolf hitler

896
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:43,210
that's not a funny joke what does

897
00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:45,190
that doing up here customer a customer

898
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:46,810
yeah and we'd go oh my god

899
00:30:46,870 --> 00:30:48,130
that's so crit okay i have

900
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,870
to get imaginative but we'll take this

901
00:30:49,870 --> 00:30:51,250
down don't worry then we just leave

902
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:52,420
it yeah i can't take it down

903
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:53,956
in front of you for somebody

904
00:30:55,630 --> 00:30:57,970
i'm not authorized to recoup any of

905
00:30:57,970 --> 00:31:00,430
these youtube they say adolf hitler because

906
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:03,190
one of those just a coincidence and

907
00:31:03,190 --> 00:31:04,930
everyone deserves that there's shamrock up on

908
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:07,210
the wall taking the dog that's right

909
00:31:08,697 --> 00:31:10,060
so yeah we would do stuff like

910
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:11,230
that so maybe it wasn't all that

911
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:13,600
great simply but but i mean we

912
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,010
were all buddies and we were all

913
00:31:15,010 --> 00:31:17,260
like constantly partying there every single night

914
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:19,390
and so she came in and she

915
00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:21,100
was she was really upset with us

916
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:22,690
about stuff like that i guess but

917
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:24,580
and she started enforcing all of the

918
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:25,990
rules that we none of us ever

919
00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:28,480
followed and but the irony of it

920
00:31:28,562 --> 00:31:30,760
zen she had a crush on a

921
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:32,440
regular customer who would drink there every

922
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:34,480
night a regular old customs yeah just

923
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:35,980

been for a beer since that show

944
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:18,460
it's amazing um so she fell in

945
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:19,750
love with this guy and so then

946
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:22,600
she would get super drunk every single

947
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:26,200
night and and then be like drunk

948
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,580
after the bar would close and be

949
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:28,960
like why doesn't he like me

950
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:31,900
me and she'd be oh yeah and

951
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:33,700
so one night this happened and she

952
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:36,070
had just met sarah running down her

953
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:39,040
face like black mascara fuck but she

954
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:42,910
was wearing um a yellow sweatshirt and

955
00:32:42,910 --> 00:32:45,700
yellow pants and my friend walked over

956
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:48,790
and said who brews the banana it's

957
00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:49,120
just

958
00:32:49,156 --> 00:32:51,040
stuck in my head but you said

959
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:53,770
we would know thirty years can i

960
00:32:53,770 --> 00:32:55,900
tell that story though but it's just

961
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:57,550
something i say anytime anyone has makeup

962
00:32:57,550 --> 00:32:59,860
running even if they're not wearing yellow

963
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:01,840
because she knows the banana that's a

964
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:04,660
funny line she must have been how

965
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:07,270
old she was okay i was eighteen

966
00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:08,950
she must have been thirty five

967
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:11,140
oh jesus that's really good i thought

968
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:12,910
yeah somebody really old yeah she seemed

969
00:33:12,910 --> 00:33:13,930
old to me but she was probably

970
00:33:13,930 --> 00:33:15,760
only thirty five anyway she she she

971
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,770
got me in the bartender fired because

972
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:19,120
you didn't invite her to do the

973
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:19,720
play

974
00:33:21,010 --> 00:33:22,720
but i was drinking one night after

975
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:24,340
the bar had closed right and i

976
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:26,530
mentioned that i mentioned i was classic

977
00:33:26,530 --> 00:33:27,880
eighty eight and she was like heraldry

978
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:28,960
like this would have been in my

979
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:31,540
file and she's like how wait what

980
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:33,970
year and then suddenly the bartender she

981
00:33:34,090 --> 00:33:36,730
disappeared the bartender came over poured out

982
00:33:36,730 --> 00:33:38,110
my drink and said you're under age

983
00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:39,280
and i didn't know that and poured

984
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:40,960
out the drink and then we button

985
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,520
then we both got fired that night

986
00:33:42,670 --> 00:33:45,160
oh yeah i had my twenty first

987
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,990
birthday like the bartender trying to sell

988
00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:48,257
it so what's the issue i know

989
00:33:48,257 --> 00:33:49,180
when i call him and tell him

990
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:52,150
to choose me young man you've deceived

991
00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:53,800
me and i shoot thinking too much

992
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:55,345
to my credit i called him and

993
00:33:55,357 --> 00:33:56,950

anyway

997
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,860

1014
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:34,450
they started checking ideas at a certain

1015
00:34:34,450 --> 00:34:36,340
point but we had the whole hey

1016
00:34:36,370 --> 00:34:37,570
come home to me the whole

1017
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,040

1020
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:44,170
go there and all my friends were

1021
00:34:44,170 --> 00:34:45,940

1028
00:34:56,650 --> 00:34:57,700
the only places i ever

1029
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,500
got carded in philly were places that

1030
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:01,120
i didn't want to go to anyway

1031
00:35:01,150 --> 00:35:03,520
it was always like weird bad vibey

1032
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,560
places but i i went wasn't an

1033
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:07,270
ideal time yeah because it seems like

1034
00:35:07,270 --> 00:35:08,890
in the city like in chicago or

1035
00:35:08,890 --> 00:35:10,360

yes and no though because like some

1037
00:35:11,650 --> 00:35:14,020
places are more strict because like it's

1038
00:35:14,290 --> 00:35:16,240
the vice cops are out around them

1039
00:35:16,246 --> 00:35:17,800
if they go against the law

1040
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:20,350
the first also the there i love

1041
00:35:20,350 --> 00:35:23,140
the idea of bars that cater almost

1042
00:35:23,170 --> 00:35:25,900
exclusively to under-age clientele yeah because the

1043
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:27,100

1177
00:39:55,690 --> 00:39:56,890
to be too much because i remember

1178
00:39:56,890 --> 00:40:00,190
my mother saying one year um because

1179
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:01,150
it was a pain in the ass

1180
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:02,320
yeah you have to cook for so

1181
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,390
many people and even with people bringing

1182
00:40:04,390 --> 00:40:05,890
things it was so many oh yeah

1183
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,510
because yeah at least the main protein

1184
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:09,310
you you have a main protein i

1185
00:40:09,310 --> 00:40:11,440
hate it when people call me two

1186
00:40:11,470 --> 00:40:13,330
things proteins it's like what are you

1187
00:40:13,330 --> 00:40:13,840

leave me alone alien i need a

1191
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:23,590
protein you need main rotate so we

1192
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:25,210
so my mother said this was supposed

1193
00:40:25,210 --> 00:40:26,500
to be like when people grew up

1194
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:28,000
and started their own families they would

1195
00:40:28,030 --> 00:40:30,001
they would do thanksgiving right yeah now

1196
00:40:30,065 --> 00:40:32,500
stay like everybody's still coming over adding

1197
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:33,970
people yeah guy

1198
00:40:34,655 --> 00:40:36,245
but it was it was especially when

1199
00:40:36,725 --> 00:40:38,615
we got older and we would see

1200
00:40:38,615 --> 00:40:40,175
the little kids now act the way

1201
00:40:40,175 --> 00:40:41,825
we acted they would just lose their

1202
00:40:41,825 --> 00:40:45,005
fucking minds like just literally running around

1203
00:40:45,005 --> 00:40:48,065
and screaming yeah um so the last

1204
00:40:48,065 --> 00:40:50,645
time i was i i was over

00:40:54,845 --> 00:40:57,455
my mom died and i stayed there

1209
00:40:57,455 --> 00:40:58,985
drinking with my cousins on because we

1210
00:40:58,985 --> 00:41:01,745

1211
00:41:01,745 --> 00:41:03,995
just be there until dawn drinking beer

1212
00:41:03,995 --> 00:41:06,005
and talking and and like that would

1213
00:41:06,005 --> 00:41:07,145
get down to like a few people

1214
00:41:07,145 --> 00:41:08,645

okay so we have a tweet from

1308
00:44:17,195 --> 00:44:21,485
tyler barnard and durden straight low rider

1309
00:44:21,515 --> 00:44:23,195
s t r eight l o a

1310
00:44:23,225 --> 00:44:26,045
cayenne and he suggested that what am

1311
00:44:26,045 --> 00:44:27,455
i thinking game you used to play

1312
00:44:27,455 --> 00:44:28,895
on comedy bang bang yeah we played

1313
00:44:28,895 --> 00:44:29,825
that a long time yeah

1314
00:44:29,825 --> 00:44:32,045
yeah i'm scott just explained it to

1315
00:44:32,045 --> 00:44:33,425
me but it also sounds like the

1316
00:44:33,455 --> 00:44:35,255
improv game mind meld but the idea

1317
00:44:35,255 --> 00:44:37,055
is each person starts just thinks of

1318
00:44:37,055 --> 00:44:38,555
a word than at the same time

1319
00:44:38,555 --> 00:44:39,485
ago three two one and we all

1320
00:44:39,485 --> 00:44:41,285
say that word yeah and we keep

1321
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:43,835
saying a new word trying to get

1322
00:44:43,835 --> 00:44:45,305
to the same word where we say

1323
00:44:45,305 --> 00:44:47,795
the in and the word went and

1324
00:44:47,795 --> 00:44:48,905
three people can play at the same

1325
00:44:48,905 --> 00:44:49,985
time or just yeah okay

1326
00:44:50,015 --> 00:44:52,115
so so so we're all gonna say

1327
00:44:52,115 --> 00:44:53,975
a different word at what point does

1328
00:44:53,975 --> 00:44:55,475
it just get absurdly you know you're

1329
00:44:55,475 --> 00:44:57,305
supposed to play i think two or

1330
00:44:57,305 --> 00:44:58,385
three but i think in a circle

1331
00:44:58,385 --> 00:44:59,975
you could do two and then like

1332
00:45:00,395 --> 00:45:01,475
you get it down and then that

1333
00:45:01,475 --> 00:45:03,095
person can play with someone else like

1334
00:45:03,125 --> 00:45:04,505
okay this was like a human but

1335
00:45:04,505 --> 00:45:05,792
we can do it with three yeah

1336
00:45:05,792 --> 00:45:07,235
yeah okay so we all were all

1337
00:45:07,235 --> 00:45:08,675
obviously going to say a different word

1338
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:10,115
at the in the first

1339
00:45:10,145 --> 00:45:11,345
word you don't know that although we

1340
00:45:11,345 --> 00:45:12,845
have we have said the same word

1341
00:45:12,845 --> 00:45:14,855
occasionally because we're looking at something like

1342
00:45:14,855 --> 00:45:16,505
me up will like be driving and

1343
00:45:16,505 --> 00:45:18,575
we'll see like hill and we'll say

1344
00:45:18,575 --> 00:45:20,285
hill you do want your driving yeah

1345
00:45:20,285 --> 00:45:21,245
we would do it while we're driving

1346
00:45:21,275 --> 00:45:22,715
oh that seems like a bad idea

1347
00:45:22,775 --> 00:45:24,125
really you're right i should try to

1348
00:45:24,125 --> 00:45:26,045
dry completely you shouldn't talk while you

1349
00:45:26,045 --> 00:45:27,455
drive i shouldn't think of a word

1350
00:45:27,455 --> 00:45:28,745
i forbid people to speak to me

1351
00:45:28,745 --> 00:45:30,305
in the car so

1352
00:45:30,335 --> 00:45:31,715
we're all gonna say a different word

1353
00:45:31,715 --> 00:45:33,215
but then the next word that we

1354
00:45:33,215 --> 00:45:34,925
say is we're trying to find the

1355
00:45:35,225 --> 00:45:37,895
either commonality or a word that's directly

1356
00:45:37,895 --> 00:45:39,665
in between or a word that reminds

1357
00:45:39,665 --> 00:45:41,495
us based on all three of the

1358
00:45:41,495 --> 00:45:43,115
word if i said chicken and you

1359
00:45:43,115 --> 00:45:45,213
said man and you say chicken and

1360
00:45:45,213 --> 00:45:47,525
you say man chicken chicken and egg

1361
00:45:47,735 --> 00:45:49,595
and then we all start to say

1362
00:45:49,595 --> 00:45:50,465
and i would like farm

1363
00:45:50,465 --> 00:45:51,555
her and you might say chef and

1364
00:45:51,555 --> 00:45:52,865
then i'm like okay what's a farmer

three words just will have three words

1368
00:45:58,235 --> 00:45:59,555
to deal with so so we all

1369
00:45:59,555 --> 00:46:00,785
think of a separate word and then

1370
00:46:00,785 --> 00:46:02,375
we say three to one and then

1371
00:46:02,375 --> 00:46:03,515
