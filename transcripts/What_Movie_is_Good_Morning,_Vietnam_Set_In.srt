00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,120
done it um as did my entire

43
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,560
family so it was it's been a

44
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,580
wild week which is why we're on

45
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:00,720
zoom last week but it's just a

46
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,940
question if they're fresh i haven't actually

47
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:05,430
tested and tested positive when we recorded

48
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:06,870
last week so i was still holding

49
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:08,130
out hope that i would be negative

50
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:10,201
but no i got it you were

51
00:02:10,201 --> 00:02:10,290
the

52
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:12,690
lower one in your household i was

53
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:14,550
which made me feel a little better

54
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:15,960
because you and i had done a

55
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,690
show just days before a little bit

56
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:19,860
i was worried that i would have

57
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:21,510
infected you but i didn't test positive

58
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:23,220
for days so it was pretty safe

59
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:24,750
to say that i wasn't worried about

60
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:26,730
it until you did mention after you

61
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:28,230
tested positive that you had had a

62
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:29,580
sore throat for days

63
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:32,700
well monday was my sore throat started

64
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:35,749
oh okay during the show oh show

65
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:38,395
yeah show a saturday or sunday sunday

66
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:41,850
sunday shows after church mike did test

67
00:02:41,850 --> 00:02:43,350
positive on monday though but then i

68
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:44,520
was like i booted him out of

69
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,750
the house you want to stay at

70
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:47,250
a good friend etc

71
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,830
v that was mt showed over the

72
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:53,310
brand yeah and then um i was

73
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:54,782
wearing a mask with holly and then

74
00:02:54,782 --> 00:02:56,250
it turned out hollywood's positive and then

75
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:57,810
i still was trying to wear a

76
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:00,930
mask and um but then i tested

77
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:02,116
positive a couple days later after wearing

78
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:03,924
mask doing it all by myself for

79
00:03:03,924 --> 00:03:06,690
a couple of days it was futile

80
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,860
because i got the

81
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,866
cobb and priority had it but then

82
00:03:09,866 --> 00:03:11,130
at least your disease husband could come

83
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:12,660
back home and help you that was

84
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:14,460
better yeah who who did he get

85
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:16,380
it because he got it first right

86
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:18,420
he did i don't remember this code

87
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:20,880
is the kissing disease and i won't

88
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:23,296
say i don't blame him and could

89
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:24,480
happen to me just as much as

90
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,980
it could that he's not in trouble

91
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,840
i'm just saying that no one should

92
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,080
be me

93
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,510
mad at mike other than fans of

94
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:32,820
this show he was massless and in

95
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:34,230
a space where there was a lot

96
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:36,630
of space between each person was found

97
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:40,620
in a giant warehouse with ten feet

98
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:43,320
at least between each person and huge

99
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:46,350
ceilings and yeah but it it got

100
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:48,240
them nonetheless yeah

101
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:51,360
um and so we're we've been holed

102
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,530
up and it's been horrible we both

103
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:54,510
got super sick it's socked it's been

104
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:55,560
bad it isn't i would not say

105
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,940
it was mild for us it was

106
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:59,250
very mild for hollywood think god it

107
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:00,540
feels like the people that are getting

108
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,460
it now from what i've heard it's

109
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:04,440
it's not like oh it felt like

110
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,150
nothing like this actually feels like you're

111
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:08,400
sick yeah we were knocked

112
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:10,170
on our asses and so it worked

113
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:11,490
out actually the timing that the fact

114
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:12,327
that i got it a couple of

115
00:04:12,327 --> 00:04:14,100
days delayed really worked out because he

116
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:16,050
was when he was sequestered at the

117
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:18,120
air bnb he was able to just

118
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,410
like sleep all day and not worry

119
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:21,090
about taking care of baby and stuff

120
00:04:21,090 --> 00:04:22,350
and then by the time i was

121
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:23,580
feeling really shitty he was back home

122
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:24,960
so i was able to lay in

123
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,480
bed oh but it sucked and i

124
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,500
feel i still don't don't

125
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,600
feel great it's been over a week

126
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:32,519
what about the babby how does that

127
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:34,800
how's the babby do she's doing great

128
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,360
she was really great after just like

129
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,680
i would say it lasted for her

130
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,950
probably like thirty six hours she was

131
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:43,470
sick definitely sick and wanting to be

132
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:45,090
held all the time and crying and

133
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:47,250
feeling bad and oh lol i never

134
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:47,670
got cold

135
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:52,620
and then i took to the doctor

136
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,570
they checked her out everything was okay

137
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:56,010
and they said it's typically been mild

138
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:57,270
what they've been seeing was then smiled

139
00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:00,030
for babies and she was a situation

140
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:01,710
where that was the case thankfully end

141
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:03,780
she was much better on the next

142
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:06,270
day and was like totally energized not

143
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:07,500
made it a little hard because we

144
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,880
were dries yeah

145
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:11,014
i showed her her first movie though

146
00:05:11,014 --> 00:05:13,500
i've never shown on tv before whoa

147
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,120
what did she think and when bobby

148
00:05:15,627 --> 00:05:18,089
turns movie i'm sorry one moment with

149
00:05:18,089 --> 00:05:19,560
scott doing an impression of a baby

150
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,930
being energized yes i'm starting what does

151
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:25,050
that sound like ie something like that

152
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:26,340
i don't know why we're like a

153
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:28,830
maid is like a mechanical sound well

154
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:29,040
i mean

155
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:31,440
it's it's a cross between honestly energizing

156
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,480
sounds like a cross between mechanical sound

157
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:36,060
and like pixie dust right no you're

158
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:38,310
right um anyhoo no no watched and

159
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:40,710
contoh and quietly and we both loved

160
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:42,780
it she kept turning around it was

161
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:43,920
so cute she kept turning around and

162
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,270
smiling at me when we were watching

163
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:47,280
it she was like really happy yeah

164
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:48,540
wow she loved

165
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,530
we watched one hour one day then

166
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:52,080
we watched the other hour the next

167
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,160
day and then when she was feeling

168
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,960
better she has no patience to sit

169
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,400
and watch a movie so that was

170
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,030
kind of cute

171
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:01,380
did she that's crunchy clock like that

172
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:03,090
it was the same movie you think

173
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,070
or i think so because i put

174
00:06:05,093 --> 00:06:06,660
on a different movie or the only

175
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:07,920
one she's ever seen so it was

176
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:11,070
like she was less than me but

177
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:13,410
then i watched turning red have you

178
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:16,140
seen that no i've heard it's good

179
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:17,130
oh my god it made me cry

180
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:18,450
at the end and i loved it

181
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,520
contoh they are both fantastic

182
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:23,340
did you read that review that they

183
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,960
that they eventually took down i forget

184
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,520
where it appeared what were like i

185
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,260
was like how can i relate to

186
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:31,050
this yes religious unreliable and it's like

187
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:33,450
what do you think movies are like

188
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,850
every story exactly to me yeah all

189
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:37,740
movies are unreliable right i mean it's

190
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:39,420
like but the movie is related but

191
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:41,040
they're just they're just as relatable as

192
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:41,280
they are

193
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:43,080
unrelated that's funny it's like yeah you

194
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,090
could say that about anything yeah but

195
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:47,100
it's it's very i found it very

196
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,630
relatable and even at the end they

197
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:50,100
have like a moral that's like we

198
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:52,729
all experience this thing so good that

199
00:06:52,729 --> 00:06:54,210
i was like how are you only

200
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:55,860
the only movie that's relatable for me

201
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:57,120
as captain america because i have a

202
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,250
really good body but so you don't

203
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:00,150
really start where he was a little

204
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:01,440
twerp no don't like

205
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,640
that your head is so much bigger

206
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:03,270
than your body

207
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,570
i've only see the first ten minutes

208
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:08,700
so i don't know you turned it

209
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,470
off in disgust that's good for students

210
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:11,430
really looks like

211
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:14,250
i this movie about a hero

212
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:18,930
well that i'm sorry to hear about

213
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:22,170
your covert gas it's sucks it sucks

214
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,610
i'm glad your feeling better though you're

215
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,050
in the mirror to think almost out

216
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:26,940

221
00:07:34,568 --> 00:07:35,490
honest with us

222
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:37,560
i know i could sell some over

223
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:39,540
there is somebody in our household who

224
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:42,120
has extreme covert fear and is convinced

225
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:44,970
that either myself or they have coded

226
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:46,770
every single day well that was me

227
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:48,870
for literally this entire time i'm always

228
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:51,210

just for two

232
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,720
years and makes until even when i

233
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:00,300
wanted to give my test he was

234
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,760
like fine like because because i am

235
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,320
always saying it and then it was

236
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:07,140
positive and we were both shocked shocked

237
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:08,820
i don't think i have it until

238
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:12,570
my roommate starts trying to talk me

239
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,030
into it yeah come on get code

240
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:15,840
and then i'm like

241
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:17,760
okay you're starting to make me think

242
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,770
it's a problem that i get offed

243
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:23,624
once yeah yeah um yeah yeah know

244
00:08:23,659 --> 00:08:25,410
goes over lining though i guess the

245
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:27,750
whole carpet situation of getting the convent

246
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,070
and having and getting through it and

247
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:30,540
be ok is like that i can

248
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:32,550
um not worry as much for like

249
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:34,170
a couple months there you have it

250
00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:35,580
there you go so that's good

251
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:37,740
cool up to co-op experience the feeling

252
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:40,230
of a little bit of freedom after

253
00:08:40,230 --> 00:08:44,220
the idea i don't know i think

254
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:46,380
so i mean we both just went

255
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:47,760
to the doctor and got our anti

256
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:52,140
bodies tested oh so mine are off

257
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:55,620
the charts baby you you have antibodies

258
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:56,100
you know you didn't

259
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,720

260
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:59,880
vaccine vaccines from the vaccine but that's

261
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,560

ah but maybe yeah i don't know

265
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:10,080
yeah they also seem to think that

266
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:13,410
maybe co-ops vaccine processed her body process

267
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,600
the virus so well that she wasn't

268
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,670

271
00:09:22,733 --> 00:09:24,330

272
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,620
zeroes and ones

273
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,100

of one to one

300
00:10:33,535 --> 00:10:35,725
fifty if you have one than you

00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:10,885
my favorite i hate when there's cream

373
00:13:10,885 --> 00:13:15,025
inside newly know we talked about this

374
00:13:15,025 --> 00:13:16,675
before because there was something that your

375
00:13:16,675 --> 00:13:18,565
brother got you to eat well i

376
00:13:18,565 --> 00:13:20,995
had a tragic time when my dad

377
00:13:20,995 --> 00:13:22,195
got me a boston kreme and dunkin

378
00:13:22,195 --> 00:13:23,245
donuts and i didn't know it was

379
00:13:23,245 --> 00:13:24,390
boston cream and i bit into it

380
00:13:24,427 --> 00:13:25,135
it was shy

381
00:13:25,135 --> 00:13:26,875
shocking and disgusting and what my brother

382
00:13:26,875 --> 00:13:28,285
did recently get me a macho doughnut

383
00:13:28,285 --> 00:13:29,395
that i may yeah but i didn't

384
00:13:29,395 --> 00:13:30,595
know there was much inside but then

385
00:13:30,595 --> 00:13:32,545
i don't like it yeah but i'm

386
00:13:32,545 --> 00:13:34,525
more open to a cream puff now

387
00:13:34,525 --> 00:13:36,355
but as a child and certainly not

388
00:13:36,415 --> 00:13:38,965
no i remember cream puffs being disappointing

389
00:13:38,965 --> 00:13:40,105
when i was a kid like it

390
00:13:40,105 --> 00:13:41,635
was yeah technically it was a sweet

391
00:13:41,635 --> 00:13:43,645
thing what's so i was i would

392
00:13:43,645 --> 00:13:45,218
eat it yeah but it just

393
00:13:45,355 --> 00:13:47,635
like the is too thin the yeah

394
00:13:47,665 --> 00:13:49,615
cream is too much it's like the

395
00:13:49,645 --> 00:13:51,895
proportions are off yeah when i was

396
00:13:51,895 --> 00:13:53,815
like where i lacked vocabulary obviously when

397
00:13:53,815 --> 00:13:55,015
i was working on destruct show we

398
00:13:55,015 --> 00:13:56,875
would slightly less talk about you want

399
00:13:56,875 --> 00:13:57,715
to talk about when you were going

400
00:13:57,715 --> 00:13:58,345

407
00:14:11,065 --> 00:14:12,985
sugar into it and then buy a

408
00:14:12,985 --> 00:14:16,435

00:14:19,645 --> 00:14:21,145
day on the way it sounds kind

412
00:14:21,145 --> 00:14:23,695
of fun that the time in your

413
00:14:23,695 --> 00:14:25,435
life good for you know what this

414
00:14:25,435 --> 00:14:28,165
feels like yeah have diarrhea but yeah

415
00:14:28,195 --> 00:14:29,845
at the time i feel like my

416
00:14:29,845 --> 00:14:31,945
stomach was well in some ways i

417
00:14:31,945 --> 00:14:33,595
could eat crazy things but then i

418
00:14:33,595 --> 00:14:34,495
had a period of time where it

419
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:36,925
was like just anything would just be

420
00:14:37,075 --> 00:14:38,935
pure diarrhea central but then i i

421
00:14:39,055 --> 00:14:39,775
move past that

422
00:14:39,808 --> 00:14:41,395
i think just from having a better

423
00:14:41,395 --> 00:14:44,202
diet speaking of eating thing you don't

424
00:14:44,202 --> 00:14:46,945

00:14:46,945 --> 00:14:49,045
me but off off my

426
00:14:50,515 --> 00:14:51,415
off like i want to talk about

427
00:14:51,415 --> 00:14:52,615
it for three hours

428
00:14:54,445 --> 00:14:55,675
there was a period of my life

429
00:14:55,735 --> 00:14:59,905
where i was ordering um a cheese

430
00:14:59,905 --> 00:15:03,625
steak sandwich every day from this place

431
00:15:03,685 --> 00:15:07,495
the philly steak depot in hollywood fucking

432
00:15:07,495 --> 00:15:09,955
disgusting i well of course i grew

433
00:15:09,955 --> 00:15:11,305
up with the sandwiches and i loved

434
00:15:11,305 --> 00:15:13,855
them and this was not entirely

435
00:15:13,855 --> 00:15:15,115
yeah it was the closest that i'd

436
00:15:15,115 --> 00:15:16,345
found at that point yeah to an

437
00:15:16,345 --> 00:15:18,025
actual philly cheese steak and of course

438
00:15:18,025 --> 00:15:20,035

440
00:15:21,805 --> 00:15:23,845
and i i did this every day

441
00:15:23,845 --> 00:15:26,665
for a long time enough so that

442
00:15:26,695 --> 00:15:29,875
the delivery guy knew me by name

443
00:15:31,645 --> 00:15:32,635

the first time i heard that song

494
00:17:02,635 --> 00:17:04,435
and i was riding in the backseat

495
00:17:04,435 --> 00:17:06,775
of my friend's car her dad was

496
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:09,265
driving and i thought it was amazing

00:17:10,285 --> 00:17:12,025
it was like so fast i was

498
00:17:12,025 --> 00:17:13,825
like wow are they saying all this

499
00:17:13,825 --> 00:17:15,505
stuff and then to remember it's very

500
00:17:15,505 --> 00:17:17,845

00:17:17,845 --> 00:17:19,465
how you know the memorized it note

502
00:17:19,495 --> 00:17:21,385
for me to memorize oh and later

503
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:23,603
yeah um they probably are reading it

504
00:17:23,603 --> 00:17:27,235
the whole time um i would know

505
00:17:27,236 --> 00:17:28,495
that part of the concert where they

506
00:17:28,495 --> 00:17:29,575
pulled out a crumpled up piece of

507
00:17:29,575 --> 00:17:30,415
paper and they're like

508
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:33,145
try not to change things in the

509
00:17:33,145 --> 00:17:35,155
studio they like couldn't record until they

510
00:17:35,155 --> 00:17:36,445
finally all memorized it

511
00:17:38,365 --> 00:17:39,265
on this right guys

512
00:17:40,495 --> 00:17:41,725
wait it's not tick tock about some

513
00:17:41,725 --> 00:17:43,975
people some people listen to music and

514
00:17:43,975 --> 00:17:46,165
hear lyrics and some people hear the

515
00:17:46,195 --> 00:17:48,115
melody which i guess i under i've

516
00:17:48,115 --> 00:17:50,155
always understood that there's literally a study

517
00:17:50,155 --> 00:17:52,465
about brains and helping some people's oh

518
00:17:52,795 --> 00:17:54,385
no don't do that but i think

519
00:17:54,385 --> 00:17:55,795
we all hear the lyric study my

520
00:17:55,795 --> 00:17:59,215
brain i well i feel like i'm

521
00:17:59,215 --> 00:18:00,535
a lyric person because i like

522
00:18:00,655 --> 00:18:03,145
lyrics or all your ex people know

523
00:18:03,145 --> 00:18:05,485
i'm not everybody is i sometimes are

524
00:18:05,485 --> 00:18:07,765
because we know lyrics just a fuck

525
00:18:07,765 --> 00:18:10,225
up what i am i think but

526
00:18:10,225 --> 00:18:12,235
i suppose when you what you sort

527
00:18:12,235 --> 00:18:13,975
of what what draws you to a

528
00:18:13,975 --> 00:18:15,385
song more and some people are driven

529
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:16,525
more by melody and some people are

530
00:18:16,525 --> 00:18:19,645
driven more by lyrics um it's like

531
00:18:19,645 --> 00:18:20,815
what you hear

532
00:18:20,815 --> 00:18:23,455
ear when you listen no okay but

533
00:18:23,455 --> 00:18:25,225
that's not what i'm talking about and

534
00:18:25,225 --> 00:18:26,155
that's what i'm talking about from the

535
00:18:26,155 --> 00:18:28,915
tick tock but look i haven't seen

536
00:18:28,915 --> 00:18:30,235
this tick tock i haven't a chance

537
00:18:30,235 --> 00:18:31,705
to read it but i will say

538
00:18:31,735 --> 00:18:32,095
this

539
00:18:33,925 --> 00:18:35,905
i have enjoyed songs where i have

540
00:18:36,025 --> 00:18:37,584
like a squeezed song or something where

541
00:18:37,584 --> 00:18:39,235
i had no idea what the fuck

542
00:18:39,235 --> 00:18:41,275
they were saying oh yeah i'm totally

543
00:18:41,275 --> 00:18:44,005
settled by the fruit of another that's

544
00:18:44,005 --> 00:18:45,175
one of the easier ones to figure

545
00:18:45,175 --> 00:18:47,665
out yeah but like pulling mussels from

546
00:18:47,665 --> 00:18:50,155
the shell they are slipping serenely difficult

547
00:18:50,215 --> 00:18:52,795
yes because really pulling muscles from michelle

548
00:18:52,795 --> 00:18:53,425
is like

549
00:18:53,485 --> 00:18:54,775
i feel like he's talking about maid

550
00:18:54,775 --> 00:18:56,361
marian at one point i think yeah

551
00:18:56,361 --> 00:18:57,895
i've thought that fate that gave me

552
00:18:57,925 --> 00:18:59,868
what i think we're saying not is

553
00:18:59,905 --> 00:19:01,105
that is what he's saying yes he's

554
00:19:01,105 --> 00:19:03,805
saying maid marian yes may with regard

555
00:19:03,835 --> 00:19:06,085
to the tiktok like from from robin

610
00:21:08,395 --> 00:21:11,605
movie um and i had a sm

611
00:21:11,605 --> 00:21:13,165
small part in it and so the

612
00:21:13,165 --> 00:21:14,324
day that i got i got there

613
00:21:14,324 --> 00:21:17,125
on a friday for work and they

614
00:21:17,185 --> 00:21:19,465
i heard in the the hair and

615
00:21:19,465 --> 00:21:20,665
makeup trailer which is where you hear

616
00:21:20,665 --> 00:21:21,625
all the gossip

617
00:21:22,885 --> 00:21:24,475
that the day before oh no this

618
00:21:24,475 --> 00:21:25,795
one went for my wardrobe fittings so

619
00:21:25,795 --> 00:21:27,295
we were away from set and the

620
00:21:27,355 --> 00:21:28,585
wardrobe people were telling me the day

621
00:21:28,585 --> 00:21:31,825
before nobody had masks on like because

622
00:21:31,825 --> 00:21:34,105
they were shooting outside nobody was wearing

623
00:21:34,105 --> 00:21:37,195
masks and that seems weird for the

624
00:21:37,195 --> 00:21:38,545
crew to not have them it feels

625
00:21:38,545 --> 00:21:41,005
like yeah exactly at a risk absolutely

626
00:21:41,005 --> 00:21:42,805
and then the so the the pair

627
00:21:42,805 --> 00:21:46,255
aren't corporation awe of his production found

628
00:21:46,255 --> 00:21:48,775
out and said um no everyone has

629
00:21:48,775 --> 00:21:50,995
to wear masks all the time and

630
00:21:51,475 --> 00:21:52,915
so then when by the time i

631
00:21:52,915 --> 00:21:54,655
got to set the crew was wearing

632
00:21:54,655 --> 00:21:56,875
them but a lot of the actors

633
00:21:57,055 --> 00:21:59,305
were just leaving them off you know

634
00:21:59,425 --> 00:22:02,215

635
00:22:02,215 --> 00:22:02,875

title of this show when mary helen

lying and saying he's doing it but

he's not

798
00:27:50,515 --> 00:27:52,525
kids lying is so funny to me

799
00:27:52,679 --> 00:27:54,715
little kids when they discover what like

800
00:27:54,835 --> 00:27:56,155
oh you can just say a thing

801
00:27:56,155 --> 00:27:58,135
that's not true when i'm gonna do

802
00:27:58,135 --> 00:27:58,975
it all the time

803
00:28:00,235 --> 00:28:02,575
i don't know what you mean maybe

804
00:28:02,575 --> 00:28:04,525
she lied about liking that movie yeah

805
00:28:04,555 --> 00:28:06,205
she was pretending she kept saying she

806
00:28:06,205 --> 00:28:07,555
wanted to work with lin manuel at

807
00:28:07,555 --> 00:28:09,175
some point phase oh she like when

808
00:28:09,175 --> 00:28:10,675
she was watching tv big scowl on

809
00:28:10,675 --> 00:28:13,195
her face how do you like mom

810
00:28:13,885 --> 00:28:15,025
hey this is going great

811
00:28:16,915 --> 00:28:19,015
now there's no there's like dangerous not

812
00:28:19,015 --> 00:28:20,545
a component right now i mean there's

813
00:28:20,819 --> 00:28:22,375
real danger but it does feel dangerous

814
00:28:22,375 --> 00:28:23,935
because the first kid is walking along

815
00:28:23,935 --> 00:28:25,915
the street it's like it just feels

816
00:28:25,915 --> 00:28:26,665
crazy

817
00:28:28,135 --> 00:28:29,845
i don't know but yeah you assume

818
00:28:29,845 --> 00:28:31,465
that there's people behind the you can't

819
00:28:31,465 --> 00:28:33,645
see that are kind of guiding communicate

820
00:28:33,685 --> 00:28:35,305
think that occasionally you do see hope

821
00:28:35,305 --> 00:28:37,885
so but but yeah it's it did

822
00:28:37,915 --> 00:28:39,445
it did feel more danger when you

823
00:28:39,445 --> 00:28:41,935
know how like lax filming standards are

824
00:28:41,935 --> 00:28:43,615
there it does feel like slightly more

825
00:28:43,615 --> 00:28:45,535
dangerous than it then it would be

826
00:28:45,565 --> 00:28:47,545
around areas they wouldn't know whenever do

827
00:28:47,545 --> 00:28:47,845
it here

828
00:28:47,845 --> 00:28:49,285
i will never ever ever have this

829
00:28:49,285 --> 00:28:50,695

00:29:18,535 --> 00:29:21,445
someone tagged me in like ah pizza

00:29:21,475 --> 00:29:23,545
vending machine in japan yes you can

846
00:29:23,545 --> 00:29:25,225
get a full pie which we also

847
00:29:25,225 --> 00:29:26,245
saw in italy i think we talked

848
00:29:26,245 --> 00:29:27,895
about it gotta be loud to magical

849
00:29:28,195 --> 00:29:30,145
but it looks fantastic and then there's

850
00:29:30,145 --> 00:29:31,885
like a part where like step three

851
00:29:31,885 --> 00:29:34,495
is like return the the metal grate

852
00:29:34,495 --> 00:29:35,575
to the in this hole and i

853
00:29:35,575 --> 00:29:37,135
was like that's our country we would

854
00:29:37,135 --> 00:29:39,655
never return the metal piece i never

855
00:29:39,835 --> 00:29:41,425
it would never go to grounds probably

856
00:29:41,425 --> 00:29:43,105
yeah yeah i'm sure it would never

857
00:29:43,135 --> 00:29:44,845
go right and it would be like

858
00:29:44,875 --> 00:29:46,345
we can't have that we can't have

859
00:29:46,375 --> 00:29:47,845
it's very when i think about stuff

860
00:29:47,845 --> 00:29:48,325
like that it's

861
00:29:48,325 --> 00:29:50,605
very dispiriting to know that oh yeah

862
00:29:50,635 --> 00:29:52,075
somebody would just trash this just for

863
00:29:52,075 --> 00:29:54,385
no reason we do live in possibly

864
00:29:54,385 --> 00:29:56,065
one of the worst countries like for

865
00:29:56,065 --> 00:29:58,495
some reasons but it's horrible for when

866
00:29:58,495 --> 00:30:01,495
i was like twenty five i went

867
00:30:01,495 --> 00:30:03,205
on a date and one of the

868
00:30:03,205 --> 00:30:04,675
first questions she asked me was that

869
00:30:04,705 --> 00:30:07,105
it took you that long yeah that's

870
00:30:07,135 --> 00:30:08,245
embarrassing dude

871
00:30:08,485 --> 00:30:11,065
before then i just fucked boy guy

872
00:30:11,065 --> 00:30:14,035
bay wow i was like let's slow

873
00:30:14,035 --> 00:30:16,105
this down a little bit ah what

874
00:30:16,105 --> 00:30:18,535
have you asked me some question but

875
00:30:18,535 --> 00:30:19,855
one of the first questions she asked

876
00:30:19,855 --> 00:30:21,925
me was was when you got to

877
00:30:21,925 --> 00:30:22,615
a movie

878
00:30:24,115 --> 00:30:25,705
do you throw your trash on the

879
00:30:25,705 --> 00:30:27,835
ground or do you pick it up

880
00:30:27,835 --> 00:30:29,425
and we're going to a movie or

881
00:30:29,425 --> 00:30:30,625
she's not asking this she was just

882
00:30:30,625 --> 00:30:32,005
asking me this as like a getting

883
00:30:32,005 --> 00:30:35,125
to know you question and i i

884
00:30:35,215 --> 00:30:36,625
it was the first time i mean

885
00:30:36,625 --> 00:30:39,325
when i grew up that's what like

886
00:30:39,445 --> 00:30:41,395
i mean you see that madman scene

887
00:30:41,395 --> 00:30:42,955
where there they go on a picnic

888
00:30:42,955 --> 00:30:43,885
and made yes

889
00:30:44,685 --> 00:30:46,575
trash on the ground you know that's

890
00:30:46,575 --> 00:30:48,495
sort of the vibe of when i

891
00:30:48,495 --> 00:30:50,205
grew up is like you know everyone

892
00:30:50,205 --> 00:30:51,255
who went to the movies is like

893
00:30:51,285 --> 00:30:52,035
oh no just put it on the

894
00:30:52,035 --> 00:30:53,895
floor because they cleaned it up yeah

895
00:30:54,165 --> 00:30:55,995
um and so i was like oh

896
00:30:55,995 --> 00:30:56,955
you just put it on the floor

897
00:30:56,955 --> 00:30:58,875
right and she's like it's so disrespectful

898
00:30:58,875 --> 00:31:01,095
to the the people who work there

899
00:31:01,095 --> 00:31:02,775
and like gave me a lecture essentially

900
00:31:02,775 --> 00:31:04,485
on our first date was wow

901
00:31:05,175 --> 00:31:06,435
um but i think about that all

902
00:31:06,435 --> 00:31:09,255
that now i'm like consciously always pick

903
00:31:09,255 --> 00:31:10,935
up my stuff and throw it away

904
00:31:10,935 --> 00:31:12,945
because course yeah you should well the

905
00:31:12,945 --> 00:31:15,195
idea that because there's certain there's certain

906
00:31:15,195 --> 00:31:16,725
people to think first of all i

907
00:31:16,725 --> 00:31:18,525
don't think it's disrespectful to leave it

908
00:31:18,525 --> 00:31:19,935
on the ground because yes that is

909
00:31:19,935 --> 00:31:22,395
their job so like was like saying

910
00:31:22,395 --> 00:31:24,525
if i was yeah like back in

911
00:31:24,525 --> 00:31:24,885
the day

912
00:31:25,155 --> 00:31:26,535
but it was like a treat for

913
00:31:26,535 --> 00:31:28,665
you in a way is essentially leave

914
00:31:28,665 --> 00:31:30,135
all your stuff and walk so it's

915
00:31:30,135 --> 00:31:32,085
not that it's disrespectful it just helps

916
00:31:32,085 --> 00:31:34,065
them out if you if you pick

917
00:31:34,065 --> 00:31:34,935
up your own shit and put it

918
00:31:34,935 --> 00:31:35,985
in the trash can you're going to

919
00:31:35,985 --> 00:31:36,855
say it helps them out if you

920
00:31:36,855 --> 00:31:37,815
leave it so they have something to

921
00:31:37,815 --> 00:31:40,815
do no but they learned the satisfaction

922
00:31:40,815 --> 00:31:42,572
of earning i know people people to

923
00:31:42,585 --> 00:31:44,265

00:36:04,515 --> 00:36:06,615
the the process of taking a little

1049
00:36:06,615 --> 00:36:09,555
bit of liquid and tricky why if

1050
00:36:09,555 --> 00:36:12,465

fml

1072
00:37:01,455 --> 00:37:03,765
when i smoked i realized one i

1073
00:37:03,765 --> 00:37:06,105
became conscious at one point of that

1074
00:37:06,105 --> 00:37:09,195
i wouldn't inhale it directly i would

1075
00:37:09,315 --> 00:37:11,775
sort of sort of gulp the smoke

1076
00:37:11,775 --> 00:37:14,235
into my mouth and then like inhale

1077
00:37:14,235 --> 00:37:16,275
it from there as opposed to just

1078
00:37:16,275 --> 00:37:18,345
like breathing through the cigarette which is

1079
00:37:18,507 --> 00:37:19,665
not like a french inhale

1080
00:37:19,665 --> 00:37:22,155
all of like it was almost yeah

1081
00:37:22,215 --> 00:37:23,595
it was almost like a french inhale

1082
00:37:23,595 --> 00:37:26,565
accepted so it stays in there yeah

1083
00:37:27,045 --> 00:37:28,155
and that would you know was that

1084
00:37:28,155 --> 00:37:29,085
would cause me to get hiccups a

1085
00:37:29,085 --> 00:37:30,165
lot as i say it seems that

1086
00:37:30,165 --> 00:37:32,295
that would be bad for various reasons

1087
00:37:32,415 --> 00:37:34,365
it was it sucked and i don't

1088
00:37:34,365 --> 00:37:36,495

1091
00:37:39,855 --> 00:37:41,535

and the tyto yeah rare arrests and

1183
00:41:05,370 --> 00:41:06,690
are you saying good morning vietnam was

1184
00:41:06,690 --> 00:41:08,760
not in the approved list it wasn't

1185
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:09,600
even though i tried to guess it

1186
00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:11,010
a bunch of times because big guys

1187
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:12,900
luis cabrera is calling me should i

1188
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:14,250
answer yeah

1189
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,340
i have no idea oh i like

1190
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:19,320
when it's a name yeah as opposed

1191
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:21,180
to just like you asked pham khoi

1192
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:24,240
people will have a name within it's

1193
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,550
like whoever pays the bill then i'm

1194
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:29,010
like this is tm i like it

1195
00:41:29,010 --> 00:41:31,170
you know and but it's someone i'm

1196
00:41:31,170 --> 00:41:32,490
working with or something for example they're

1197
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:33,660
calling me and then it says like

1198
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:34,770
you know

1199
00:41:34,830 --> 00:41:38,250
jonathan reiki is calling you and then

1200
00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:39,630
i'm like i answered and it's like

1201
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:41,730
a little girl right nikki or whatever

1202
00:41:41,730 --> 00:41:43,770
you know but it's like don't do

1203
00:41:43,770 --> 00:41:46,140
that well but do you think that

1204
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:47,910
they should list every single person who's

1205
00:41:47,910 --> 00:41:49,230
in a household on it it's just

1206
00:41:49,290 --> 00:41:51,778
a phone number and the okay and

1207
00:41:51,778 --> 00:41:53,280
i think there's someone's name i think

1208
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,480
it should pop you're like you're saying

1209
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:54,930
there's no back

1210
00:41:54,930 --> 00:41:57,510
color har i think it should talk

1211
00:41:57,510 --> 00:41:58,920
if you're already and then the one

1212
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:02,610
that's calling should blink you think the

1213
00:42:02,610 --> 00:42:04,110
color your onus should be on the

1214
00:42:04,110 --> 00:42:06,450
caller to press like two four this

1215
00:42:06,450 --> 00:42:08,850
is the person that's calling exactly exactly

1216
00:42:09,270 --> 00:42:10,710
i think only thing on the call

1217
00:42:10,711 --> 00:42:12,600
just didn't say a name because it

1218
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:14,490
throws you for a loop well like

1219
00:42:14,790 --> 00:42:15,090
at our

1220
00:42:15,090 --> 00:42:17,730
our household cool op's name is on

1221
00:42:17,730 --> 00:42:18,750
the bill like in the middle of

1222
00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:21,630
your street hold you guess she is

1223
00:42:21,630 --> 00:42:25,050
the bill because i i yeah people

1224
00:42:25,050 --> 00:42:26,704
people will say like cool up oh

1225
00:42:26,704 --> 00:42:28,350
go oh no no it's seeing the

1226
00:42:28,350 --> 00:42:30,570
land is capable of us i don't

1227
00:42:30,570 --> 00:42:31,830
think that's good because they're getting their

1228
00:42:31,830 --> 00:42:33,600
expectations they set the bar very high

1229
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:34,530
they think oh i wanna speak to

1230
00:42:34,530 --> 00:42:35,250

conversation about what's in her cart and

1233
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:39,840
then you're on the other end and

1234
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:40,710

00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,070
not a hassle if there's no way

1306
00:44:50,100 --> 00:44:52,350
it's it's always yeah it's always like

1307
00:44:52,350 --> 00:44:54,210
getting all these different parties involved it's

1308
00:44:54,210 --> 00:44:55,200
like you have to take all the

1309
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:57,750
measurements you have to take pictures you

1310
00:44:57,750 --> 00:44:59,850
know all the shit um measure so

1311
00:44:59,850 --> 00:45:00,390
i don't

1312
00:45:00,450 --> 00:45:02,400
team i just donate things but yeah

1313
00:45:02,430 --> 00:45:03,240
you have to you have to take

1314
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:04,170
first you have to take a nude

1315
00:45:04,170 --> 00:45:05,790
picture then you take a picture of

1316
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:07,890
the clothes on then you take a

1317
00:45:07,890 --> 00:45:09,510
picture of yourself nude holding the clothes

1318
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:11,520
next to you how much do you

1319
00:45:11,550 --> 00:45:14,130
think like goodwill and places like that

1320
00:45:14,130 --> 00:45:16,170
will cole the things that are given

1321
00:45:16,590 --> 00:45:19,200
because i feel like it's like i

1322
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:20,610
know i'll deal

1323
00:45:20,610 --> 00:45:23,280
sent i'd also heard that from somebody

1324
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:25,500
that worked at goodwill years ago that

1325
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:27,570
i used to know that the the

1326
00:45:27,570 --> 00:45:29,580
way that's done is not it's not

1327
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:31,170
because they just put like entirely fair

1328
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:33,090
well they they keep good stuff for

1329
00:45:33,090 --> 00:45:35,756
themselves or whatever and you know i

1330
00:45:35,756 --> 00:45:36,930
know it's not dumb and then they

1331
00:45:36,930 --> 00:45:39,300
sell stuff well um yeah it's not

1332
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:40,740
democratic the store is not good

1333
00:45:40,770 --> 00:45:44,310
vote it should be a meritocracy yeah

1334
00:45:45,930 --> 00:45:47,490
so on everyone should hold they should

1335
00:45:47,490 --> 00:45:49,680
hold up each item that's that's donated

1336
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:51,300
and then everyone should vote on which

1337
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:52,680
employees should get to take it home

1338
00:45:52,710 --> 00:45:54,300
yeah who it's most like or who

1339
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:56,610
it's most for and then anything that

1340
00:45:56,610 --> 00:45:58,140
doesn't get voted on can stay and

1341
00:45:58,140 --> 00:45:59,730
they can sell it yeah organ will

1342
00:45:59,730 --> 00:46:01,980
should be just an auction house and

1343
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:03,270
you go in there and they have

1344
00:46:03,270 --> 00:46:05,490
auctions every hour you go in there

1345
00:46:05,670 --> 00:46:07,320
they auction the stuff off and then

1346
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:09,480
whatever doesn't get sold you can have

1347
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:11,370
that if you're an employee like how

1348
00:46:11,370 --> 00:46:15,030
often does goodwill donate a you know

1349
00:46:15,090 --> 00:46:17,490
five thousand shirts to like homeless people

1350
00:46:17,490 --> 00:46:19,530
or something yeah i know it's like

1351
00:46:19,530 --> 00:46:22,230
that every like every hour usually

1352
00:46:23,370 --> 00:46:24,930
i don't know if they're there i

1353
00:46:24,930 --> 00:46:26,430
don't know like the the extent of

1354
00:46:26,430 --> 00:46:28,440
the goodwill operation i believe it's just

1355
00:46:28,470 --> 00:46:30,000
that's it it's the store so it's

1356
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:32,910
it's it's for people to get inexpensive

1357
00:46:32,910 --> 00:46:34,890
clothing they don't think and go to

1358
00:46:34,890 --> 00:46:35,970
a place to get an expensive but

1359
00:46:35,970 --> 00:46:37,110
i will say i feel like in

1360
00:46:37,110 --> 00:46:40,050
l a it's not cheap goodwill no

1361
00:46:40,590 --> 00:46:42,060
it doesn't the prices are not low

1362
00:46:42,060 --> 00:46:43,410
enough they're not as those they

1363
00:46:43,410 --> 00:46:45,210
should be up isn't goodwill also a

1364
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:48,360
charitable organization so yeah i'd say it's

1365
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:49,590
like bad or something i don't know

1366
00:46:49,590 --> 00:46:51,000

1369
00:46:53,730 --> 00:46:55,620

1370
00:46:55,620 --> 00:46:57,690

so good about it it feels great

1390
00:47:32,340 --> 00:47:33,840
i'm just like because i've been shoving

1391
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:35,280
clothes in my closet and then going

1392
00:47:35,340 --> 00:47:37,500
i don't wear any of this and

1393
00:47:37,530 --> 00:47:38,940
it makes me feel bad about myself

1394
00:47:38,970 --> 00:47:40,590
to see it all and feel like

1395
00:47:40,590 --> 00:47:41,790
i'm in a lot of that a

1396
00:47:41,790 --> 00:47:42,660
lot of it i have worn a

1397
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:43,860
lot it's just you know the

1398
00:47:43,890 --> 00:47:46,470
pandemic kind of changed my style and

1399
00:47:46,470 --> 00:47:48,060
all that stuff so i feel like

1400
00:47:48,060 --> 00:47:50,460
my entire closet is aspirational like ok

1401
00:47:50,460 --> 00:47:52,290
i'll get back oh i'll get back

1402
00:47:52,290 --> 00:47:53,790
to that yeah some point

1403
00:47:55,110 --> 00:47:57,390
so true but then i was thinking

1404
00:47:57,390 --> 00:47:59,040
that was not making me feel good

1405
00:47:59,250 --> 00:48:01,110
so i know i was getting so

1406
00:48:01,110 --> 00:48:04,530
close to that that place of like

1407
00:48:04,530 --> 00:48:05,370
there were a couple of things are

1408
00:48:05,370 --> 00:48:07,500
like oh i'm almost there and then

1409
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:08,910
the holidays came and i gained a

1410
00:48:08,910 --> 00:48:10,380
bunch of fuckin weight back and now

1411
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:11,520
i'm trying to take that off and

1412
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:13,080
i'm trying but that's the main thing

1413
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:15,032
is trying not to feel bad about

1414
00:48:15,032 --> 00:48:15,090
it

1415
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:17,490
yeah bro i'm trying to feel yeah

1416
00:48:17,490 --> 00:48:18,540
but i think that's good because then

1417
00:48:18,540 --> 00:48:19,380
i was like you know what i

1418
00:48:19,380 --> 00:48:21,570
just have to like buy jeans that

1419
00:48:21,570 --> 00:48:23,250
fit me right now and that's where

1420
00:48:23,250 --> 00:48:24,840
living and then feel good about that

1421
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:26,100
and then that's making me feel more

1422
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:28,350
excited and then i'm like whatever happens

1423
00:48:28,350 --> 00:48:30,060
next i'll get new jeans you know

1424
00:48:30,060 --> 00:48:32,640
wearing clothes that fit you as opposed

1425
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:34,740
to wearing clothes that almost fit you

1426
00:48:34,770 --> 00:48:35,250
in so

1427
00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:38,130
it's feels so much better yeah it's

1428
00:48:38,130 --> 00:48:40,380
great like diana just literal better and

1429
00:48:40,470 --> 00:48:42,270
yeah we should we should buy each

1430
00:48:42,270 --> 00:48:45,630
other it's a tailor sessions we should

1431
00:48:45,630 --> 00:48:47,190
buy each other wardrobes and just see

1432
00:48:47,190 --> 00:48:48,990
what kind of style i want they

1433
00:48:48,990 --> 00:48:51,690
should give each other five thousand dollars

1434
00:48:52,620 --> 00:48:54,376
okay this is a good idea it's

1435
00:48:54,376 --> 00:48:55,350
this other great idea

1436
00:48:55,410 --> 00:48:56,520
it's a great way let's just eat

1437
00:48:56,530 --> 00:48:58,740
each other five thousand dollars to do

1660
00:57:26,460 --> 00:57:28,020
so mean to service to yourself into

1661
00:57:28,020 --> 00:57:30,570
us yeah well it's a disservice to

1662
00:57:30,570 --> 00:57:32,160
us because we're the ones who trained

1663
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:32,490
you

1664
00:57:33,030 --> 00:57:34,020
and we put all the money into

00:57:34,020 --> 00:57:36,750
this yeah what did the it's a

1666
00:57:36,750 --> 00:57:39,360
lot of money paul it's expensive for

1667
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:40,650
you get your dorky glasses in your

1668
00:57:40,650 --> 00:57:42,510
stupid outfit yeah

1669
00:57:44,190 --> 00:57:47,190
and and the the the the actual

1670
00:57:47,250 --> 00:57:49,770
you know the board ain't cheap you

1671
00:57:49,770 --> 00:57:52,140
know what i mean board the little

1672
00:57:52,140 --> 00:57:54,870
whores the board green did that what

1673
00:57:54,870 --> 00:57:56,010
did they tell you that i did

1674
00:57:57,450 --> 00:57:59,190
well what do you think you did

1675
00:57:59,460 --> 00:58:00,510
for us into

1676
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:03,870
that way i know i was there

1677
00:58:03,870 --> 00:58:06,150
with my dorky glasses and my stupid

1678
00:58:06,150 --> 00:58:08,340
outfit and the bore and there was

1679
00:58:08,340 --> 00:58:10,440
the board and i don't know i

1680
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:13,110
guess i just got nervous i don't

1681
00:58:13,110 --> 00:58:15,060
think it's you got nervous i think

1682
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:16,770
you were trying to help someone less

1683
00:58:16,770 --> 00:58:18,960
fortunate or less intelligent than you and

1684
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:21,090
that's maybe not right i saw this

1685
00:58:21,090 --> 00:58:21,720
person and

1686
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:23,160
and that made me nervous

1687
00:58:23,910 --> 00:58:24,779
and so i thought i got to

1688
00:58:24,779 --> 00:58:26,880
help why are you nervous to see

1689
00:58:26,901 --> 00:58:28,800
you see this person every single day

1690
00:58:28,890 --> 00:58:30,600
at school this is your

1691
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:34,050
no yeah relationship to them you know

1692
00:58:34,050 --> 00:58:34,920
what it is i don't want to

1693
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:36,180
sort of label on it but it's

1694
00:58:36,180 --> 00:58:38,700
my classmate i think yeah but a

1695
00:58:38,700 --> 00:58:40,200
little more than a classmate yeah i

1696
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:42,480
mean my friend yeah yeah but a

1697
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:43,980
little more than i mean you know

1698
00:58:44,220 --> 00:58:47,730
like my status event yeah exactly wesley

1699
00:58:47,730 --> 00:58:49,140
exact you know he's part of our

1700
00:58:49,140 --> 00:58:51,060
family but i know you guys love

1701
00:58:51,060 --> 00:58:51,960
wesley sometimes i think

1702
00:58:52,068 --> 00:58:54,120
like more than me we don't and

1703
00:58:54,120 --> 00:58:56,280
we actually we might start we might

1704
00:58:56,280 --> 00:58:57,540
start loving him more than you if

1705
00:58:57,540 --> 00:58:59,910
you let him continue to let him

1706
00:59:00,450 --> 00:59:01,710
excel in this area

1707
00:59:03,180 --> 00:59:05,760
yeah i know but i guess i

1708
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:07,560
felt bad for him because my best

1709
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:09,960
friend and all and thought like maybe

1710
00:59:10,230 --> 00:59:11,550
i should let him excel in this

1711
00:59:11,550 --> 00:59:13,140
area instead of me for a change

1712
00:59:13,350 --> 00:59:15,690
but you're the gte you're the genius

1713
00:59:15,870 --> 00:59:17,640
i know that's why i wanted him

1714
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:19,470
to feel like it like he doesn't

1715
00:59:19,470 --> 00:59:20,640
even he doesn't even know what the

1716
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:22,920
horses called the i know but

1717
00:59:22,950 --> 00:59:24,750
i told him it's that's the night

1718
00:59:24,780 --> 00:59:27,090
and you just imagine a night riding

1719
00:59:27,090 --> 00:59:28,680
on him and and and he rides

1720
00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:30,750

1721
00:59:30,750 --> 00:59:32,970

1722
00:59:33,210 --> 00:59:35,160

1724
00:59:38,670 --> 00:59:40,530
i mean that shows reruns so we

1725
00:59:40,530 --> 00:59:42,660

1726
00:59:42,660 --> 00:59:46,050

1727
00:59:46,050 --> 00:59:47,880

1831
01:03:44,050 --> 01:03:45,130
to talk to you about something very

1832
01:03:45,130 --> 01:03:48,250
important what is it well it's your

1833
01:03:48,250 --> 01:03:50,020
behavior yeah mine

1834
01:03:50,020 --> 01:03:53,350
mine eat rocks hey we don't say

1835
01:03:53,350 --> 01:03:55,930
that and the cells go anyway because

1836
01:03:55,930 --> 01:03:57,730
it doesn't really make need a refresher

1837
01:03:57,760 --> 01:03:58,990
go out front and read the sign

1838
01:03:59,470 --> 01:04:00,760

1839
01:04:00,760 --> 01:04:02,230
eat rocks because they don't taste good

1846
01:04:10,210 --> 01:04:10,840
