it for like christmas like christmas bells

78
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,810
or whatever maybe or she just never

79
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:25,830
did but it's that thing you tell

80
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:27,120
yourself about where it's like to save

81
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,350
money yeah this is not a waste

82
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:29,640
of money so i won't resent my

83
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,600
child yeah

84
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:35,010
but yeah bell could have cost i

85
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:37,260
know well when you were little what

86
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:37,950
ten cents

87
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:44,880
that's actually not far off probably um

88
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:48,150
i mean every i i saw ah

89
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,010
you know my my father once told

90
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:52,470
me that the seniors i'm sorry it's

91
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:55,230
killing me because i'm the oldest nah

92
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:58,200
we always make buying this and it's

93
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,280
somehow due to my

94
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,380
a relationship with coop as well it

95
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:03,090
is part of that and she's not

96
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:06,600
young anymore either she is usually child

97
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,720
bride you are no elderly she's twelve

98
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,850
year a hundred when you were born

99
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:12,960
in the hay penny was a lot

100
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:13,316
of money

101
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:16,590
my father once told me that the

102
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:18,090
sign of getting old is when you

103
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:21,390
have like inflation sticker shock when everything

104
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:24,270
the price of everything is like upsetting

105
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:25,920
to you um

106
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:28,020
because you remember when you were younger

107
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:29,520
and you're like this shouldn't cost so

108
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,930
much and i felt that the other

109
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:32,430
day this is bad but i saw

110
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,970

back in the day but now and

127
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:10,140

to get like one gallon of gas

129
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,150

anyway so there you go you are

131
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,000
old and because you're upset about it

132
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,310

147
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,080
funny that some of you

148
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,390

149
00:05:57,450 --> 00:06:00,240

rebate

151
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:04,230
he's been a machine at um where

152
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:06,030
i went to theatre school and we

153
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:07,770
learned that trick where you could like

154
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,900
tip it over yeah shake all the

155
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:12,000
stuff out and we did it so

156
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,710
much because we were so broken so

157
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:15,600
hungry all the time and that was

158
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,890
the only food anywhere and we would

159
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:19,470
do it so much that adventure anywhere

160
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,440
any time i guess we lived in

161
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,460
a dystopian future

162
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:26,760
well actually we did live we didn't

163
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,560
go to school right stupid and it

164
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,150
was next to a cost of seventy

165
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:34,140
but it's too to the point where

166
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:35,820
i think costco how long has costco

167
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:36,330
been around

168
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:39,360
i only heard about it in decades

169
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,097
and decades really because i just had

170
00:06:41,097 --> 00:06:42,150
never heard about it till i was

171
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:43,050
like an adult i don't know if

172
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:45,180
we're wrong well why would you care

173
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:47,430
why would you care because materials didn't

174
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:48,750
shop in bulk so i guess i

175
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:49,680
wouldn't need to know is what you're

176
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,540
saying no i mean it's not the

177
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:52,980
most fun place to go as you

178
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:54,660
personally wouldn't be something that's on your

179
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:55,908
radar because you wouldn't go there like

180
00:06:55,908 --> 00:06:57,600
i didn't know about a carburetor until

181
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:59,340
i was you know sixteen and had

182
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:00,870

226
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:26,670
weren't splitting it with ten friends

227
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:28,950
that's true it was them and their

228
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:32,700
private chef when ah when cool i've

229
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:35,610
worked with them we wanted her to

230
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:38,010
ask them were there any sparklers there

231
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:42,240
to see just if like they carried

232
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,710
over because they were there in december

233
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:45,150
i think just to see if like

234
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:47,160
they got passed down to every generation

235
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:49,050
yeah that day when we were doing

236
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:51,300
the detective work to figure out if

237
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:52,500
it was the same house was a

238
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,180
lot of fun yes because i posted

239
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:56,040
on their instagram sardine i think fate

was the first to figure it out

241
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:59,280
yeah and then she she and

242
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:01,080
it was like from all angles we

243
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,700
were like we were like looking in

244
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:05,340

373
00:13:12,115 --> 00:13:13,795
we went up into the hills which

374
00:13:13,825 --> 00:13:15,955
you don't really ever go you know

375
00:13:15,955 --> 00:13:17,485
like driving in the wind in the

376
00:13:17,485 --> 00:13:19,795
middle of maui you know and where

377
00:13:19,825 --> 00:13:22,495
to wear a relative lived and it

378
00:13:22,495 --> 00:13:24,055
was interesting because no one ever you

379
00:13:24,055 --> 00:13:26,095
know would go there when you're on

380
00:13:26,095 --> 00:13:28,345

381
00:13:28,405 --> 00:13:28,675
i love

382
00:13:28,675 --> 00:13:30,205
of seeing where locals live because it

383
00:13:30,205 --> 00:13:31,855
is very cool like the eye it

384
00:13:31,855 --> 00:13:32,725
makes you think it would be the

385
00:13:32,725 --> 00:13:33,985
most beautiful place in the world to

386
00:13:33,985 --> 00:13:36,355

387
00:13:36,355 --> 00:13:37,135
we look into it

388
00:13:38,605 --> 00:13:40,255

389
00:13:40,255 --> 00:13:41,485
at how much it was and were

390
00:13:41,485 --> 00:13:44,125

00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:46,315
us but then we forgot we're all

392
00:13:46,315 --> 00:13:48,265

393
00:13:48,265 --> 00:13:50,155
ten ways oh wait no it's actually

394
00:13:50,155 --> 00:13:50,695
five points

395
00:13:51,985 --> 00:13:53,485
i like when you go to hawaii

396
00:13:53,485 --> 00:13:54,895
and if you know someone who lives

397
00:13:54,895 --> 00:13:56,365

398
00:13:56,365 --> 00:13:58,735
doors we can go behind it yeah

399
00:13:58,765 --> 00:14:00,775
behind hawaii yeah i said yeah it's

400
00:14:00,775 --> 00:14:02,305

431
00:15:14,515 --> 00:15:15,685
things about it but i'm sure i

432
00:15:15,685 --> 00:15:17,425
was thinking like cooler you know whenever

433
00:15:17,425 --> 00:15:19,165
i was a kid but then i

434
00:15:19,345 --> 00:15:20,545
looked at the video and i was

435
00:15:20,545 --> 00:15:22,105
like and i couldn't even like

436
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:25,705
listed like it was like so boring

437
00:15:25,795 --> 00:15:28,525
was it about silverware or yeah and

438
00:15:28,525 --> 00:15:30,145
then like stuff walking with a book

439
00:15:30,145 --> 00:15:32,815
on your head a lot like what

440
00:15:32,845 --> 00:15:35,695

441
00:15:35,695 --> 00:15:37,315
there wasn't some fun at all no

442
00:15:37,315 --> 00:15:39,265
i i know it's so strange and

443
00:15:39,265 --> 00:15:40,585
then another one i think they were

444
00:15:40,585 --> 00:15:41,665
having fun but that was

445
00:15:42,385 --> 00:15:45,325
no doubt and another one was aladdin

446
00:15:45,325 --> 00:15:47,515
themed his aladdin had come out recently

447
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:51,955
and was a gypsy and my uncle

448
00:15:51,955 --> 00:15:55,225
was like i don't know no like

449
00:15:55,255 --> 00:15:58,555
a gypsy man or something yeah they

450
00:15:58,555 --> 00:16:00,445
were wearing like one of the romani

451
00:16:00,955 --> 00:16:02,485
yeah um

452
00:16:02,605 --> 00:16:06,025
and that was supposedly fun and then

453
00:16:06,115 --> 00:16:07,705
ah i did another one that was

454
00:16:07,846 --> 00:16:10,855
that was mostly fun i don't know

455
00:16:10,855 --> 00:16:12,055
if this was somebody else's party or

456
00:16:12,055 --> 00:16:13,285
this is known party but i was

457
00:16:13,285 --> 00:16:15,925
a heroine dalmatians party where we um

458
00:16:16,075 --> 00:16:17,125
ah

459
00:16:17,185 --> 00:16:18,535
pay our facebook and then i got

460
00:16:18,535 --> 00:16:20,185
tails with spots on which was a

461
00:16:20,185 --> 00:16:22,435
tube sock with black spots huh

462
00:16:22,825 --> 00:16:25,375
but but yeah i like cute parties

463
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:26,935
they were very themed um and then

464
00:16:26,935 --> 00:16:29,335
when i got older more i would

465
00:16:29,335 --> 00:16:30,788
just have like house parties and stuff

466
00:16:30,955 --> 00:16:32,725
i remember i was thinking of a

467
00:16:32,725 --> 00:16:35,395
party today that i had on halloween

468
00:16:35,395 --> 00:16:37,045
when i got into seventh the seventh

469
00:16:37,045 --> 00:16:38,185
grade i got a bunch of new

470
00:16:38,185 --> 00:16:42,835
friends right and my parents went all

471
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:44,455
all out i'm thinking about this probably

472
00:16:44,455 --> 00:16:45,715
because i had new friends and they

473
00:16:45,715 --> 00:16:47,517
wanted me to impress them or whatever

474
00:16:47,517 --> 00:16:48,865
and we have this halloween party where

475
00:16:48,865 --> 00:16:51,655
it it was like everyone dressed up

476
00:16:52,015 --> 00:16:53,635
and there was a cauldron where we

477
00:16:53,635 --> 00:16:55,555
bobbed for apples and there was like

478
00:16:55,555 --> 00:16:57,895
a murder mystery element to it and

479
00:16:57,895 --> 00:17:01,375
i remember many things i remember you

480
00:17:01,375 --> 00:17:02,535
get apples you get the murder mystery

481
00:17:02,545 --> 00:17:02,965
and get both

482
00:17:04,375 --> 00:17:07,015
i remember my friends and me suddenly

483
00:17:07,015 --> 00:17:10,495
feeling embarrassed because we were i could

484
00:17:10,495 --> 00:17:11,845
feel we were too old for it

485
00:17:11,845 --> 00:17:14,455
yeah and i felt so bad that

486
00:17:14,455 --> 00:17:16,135
my parents went to all this trouble

487
00:17:16,135 --> 00:17:18,475
and suddenly like i felt embarrassed for

488
00:17:18,475 --> 00:17:20,815
them that they were trying too hard

489
00:17:20,815 --> 00:17:22,675
and i felt embarrassed for myself like

490
00:17:22,675 --> 00:17:23,155
i seem

491
00:17:23,155 --> 00:17:26,275
i'm like a kid and then that

492
00:17:26,275 --> 00:17:27,565
was the last theme party i think

493
00:17:27,565 --> 00:17:30,055
i ever had oh yeah that was

494
00:17:30,055 --> 00:17:32,305
not a thing when i was growing

495
00:17:32,305 --> 00:17:33,985
up party or where i grew up

496
00:17:34,405 --> 00:17:36,925
teams it was just like it it

497
00:17:37,405 --> 00:17:39,565
like mostly what i remember is having

498
00:17:39,595 --> 00:17:42,145
um just like dinner with the family

499
00:17:42,145 --> 00:17:43,244
and it's like i got to have

500
00:17:43,315 --> 00:17:44,845
whatever i wanted from the nurses and

501
00:17:45,295 --> 00:17:48,085
oh several it was a courses party

502
00:17:48,325 --> 00:17:49,555
so i guess it was a theme

503
00:17:49,705 --> 00:17:53,305
ah but like if you went to

504
00:17:53,305 --> 00:17:54,743
a friend's house for their party it

505
00:17:54,743 --> 00:17:56,965
was just like yeah it would take

506
00:17:56,965 --> 00:17:59,185
would be the the theme yeah exactly

507
00:17:59,215 --> 00:18:00,565
play yeah it was just played with

508
00:18:00,565 --> 00:18:02,125
like yeah your little school friends and

509
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:03,475
everything you write making ice cream

510
00:18:03,475 --> 00:18:05,335
yeah that's i guess usually house did

511
00:18:05,335 --> 00:18:06,925
not get like the the person whose

512
00:18:06,925 --> 00:18:08,605
birthday was they got presence but nobody

513
00:18:08,605 --> 00:18:09,835
else did they were not like party

514
00:18:09,835 --> 00:18:12,625
favors and china yeah that's usually how

515
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:14,125
it was i think you'll like most

516
00:18:14,155 --> 00:18:15,413
you'd have a pinata or something and

517
00:18:15,413 --> 00:18:16,735
people would or a slip and slider

518
00:18:16,735 --> 00:18:20,725
whatever but i think the star wars

519
00:18:20,725 --> 00:18:22,555
one was just i don't think anyone

520
00:18:22,555 --> 00:18:23,635
was encouraged to dress up

521
00:18:23,665 --> 00:18:24,685
star wars it was just it was

522
00:18:24,685 --> 00:18:26,156
the star wars cake yeah you know

523
00:18:26,156 --> 00:18:27,385
it was like actually i think i

524
00:18:27,385 --> 00:18:29,034
asked for action figures i should hold

525
00:18:29,034 --> 00:18:29,935
they were on and they were on

526
00:18:29,935 --> 00:18:32,125
the cake i think but the halloween

527
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:33,295
is a theme i mean you can't

528
00:18:33,295 --> 00:18:35,155
have a helloween party and not the

529
00:18:35,155 --> 00:18:37,705
theme not be halloween yeah exactly yeah

530
00:18:37,765 --> 00:18:39,775

00:23:12,945 --> 00:23:14,895

just drive me crazy yeah teams like

681
00:23:37,515 --> 00:23:39,525

drink coffee and i don't know anything

747
00:26:00,555 --> 00:26:01,965
about it so i was like trying

748
00:26:01,965 --> 00:26:03,765
to learn whatever drink was and then

749
00:26:03,765 --> 00:26:05,445
how to make it and then in

750
00:26:05,445 --> 00:26:07,755
new york as in many big cities

751
00:26:07,785 --> 00:26:09,075
everyone's rushing in they know because i

752
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:10,125
go there every day and they know

753
00:26:10,125 --> 00:26:11,715
what they want and and everyone else

754
00:26:11,715 --> 00:26:13,485
there's really good at doing that and

755
00:26:13,485 --> 00:26:15,135
i was like really stressed out i

756
00:26:15,135 --> 00:26:17,145
think i only really i trained a

757
00:26:17,145 --> 00:26:17,505
few days

758
00:26:17,554 --> 00:26:19,245
i think i actually only worked like

759
00:26:19,455 --> 00:26:20,655
did you get fired or were you

760
00:26:20,655 --> 00:26:21,825
like ok i am a lose i

761
00:26:21,825 --> 00:26:22,485
quit i

762
00:26:23,535 --> 00:26:24,765
i was so stressed out by i

763
00:26:24,765 --> 00:26:25,965
would go home and just think about

764
00:26:25,965 --> 00:26:27,555
it the whole time i was home

765
00:26:27,555 --> 00:26:29,415
like i can't go back there when

766
00:26:29,415 --> 00:26:31,005
you yelled at a lot by people

767
00:26:31,005 --> 00:26:33,075
of like come on hon and probably

768
00:26:33,105 --> 00:26:34,845
but like it's all a blur the

769
00:26:34,845 --> 00:26:35,805
big thing to me was like i

770
00:26:35,805 --> 00:26:38,355
just can't go there i can't do

771
00:26:38,355 --> 00:26:40,335
this i don't the idea of going

772
00:26:40,335 --> 00:26:42,285
there is hell and just the fact

773
00:26:42,285 --> 00:26:43,365
that i have to go again makes

774
00:26:43,365 --> 00:26:43,665
every

775
00:26:43,665 --> 00:26:45,675
living moment horrible like i write this

776
00:26:45,675 --> 00:26:47,055
is bad how long did you last

777
00:26:47,295 --> 00:26:48,885
a few days and then i called

778
00:26:48,885 --> 00:26:49,935
and they really spread out but it

779
00:26:49,935 --> 00:26:51,645
was like the torture of my mind

780
00:26:51,855 --> 00:26:53,685
and then i called and quit and

781
00:26:53,685 --> 00:26:54,795
the woman was like not cool about

782
00:26:54,795 --> 00:26:56,055
about whatever but i still wanted to

783
00:26:56,055 --> 00:26:57,285
get my hundred dollar check that i

784
00:26:57,285 --> 00:27:00,525
had and that was really embarrassing because

785
00:27:00,525 --> 00:27:01,185
i had to go in and like

786
00:27:01,185 --> 00:27:03,255
yeah go in yeah yeah oh you

787
00:27:03,255 --> 00:27:03,735
needed it

788
00:27:03,825 --> 00:27:05,025
i would have mailed it to know

789
00:27:05,025 --> 00:27:06,705
there was never even but she's you

790
00:27:06,705 --> 00:27:08,295
can come and get it yeah it's

791
00:27:08,295 --> 00:27:09,855
probably just being bitchy i never even

792
00:27:09,855 --> 00:27:11,235
consider that i could get mailed but

793
00:27:11,235 --> 00:27:13,275
she was definitely inconveniencing you on purpose

794
00:27:13,275 --> 00:27:16,155
yeah i had a very similar situation

795
00:27:16,185 --> 00:27:17,805
when i was in filling and starting

796
00:27:17,805 --> 00:27:19,575
standup i lived with my girlfriend at

797
00:27:19,575 --> 00:27:21,885
the time my day job i've had

798
00:27:21,915 --> 00:27:23,655
in the belfry briefly went away because

799
00:27:23,655 --> 00:27:23,985
the store

800
00:27:23,985 --> 00:27:26,445
it closed down for what to many

801
00:27:26,445 --> 00:27:28,515
bats in the hats yeah in the

802
00:27:28,515 --> 00:27:30,765
belfry yeah the basket confused and they

803
00:27:30,765 --> 00:27:32,625
thought they belonged there hey this is

804
00:27:32,625 --> 00:27:34,575
betsson the rendering all that

805
00:27:35,865 --> 00:27:37,065
and then people got scared because it

806
00:27:37,065 --> 00:27:39,495
had just flying that would be so

807
00:27:39,495 --> 00:27:39,825
cute

808
00:27:40,545 --> 00:27:41,985
it would be cute if the hats

809
00:27:41,985 --> 00:27:44,025
were small enough for the bets sure

810
00:27:44,085 --> 00:27:45,585
sure if that's a big you don't

811
00:27:45,585 --> 00:27:47,235
think about how he's nodding around his

812
00:27:47,235 --> 00:27:49,005
cute the hats fly around his cute

813
00:27:49,065 --> 00:27:50,355
that's cute yeah so either way it's

814
00:27:50,355 --> 00:27:50,565
good

815
00:27:52,095 --> 00:27:54,585
so i had to get a job

816
00:27:54,705 --> 00:27:57,285
and i went and applied at this

817
00:27:57,705 --> 00:27:59,325
at this coffee shop and independent coffee

818
00:27:59,325 --> 00:28:02,505
shop um downtown which is like a

819
00:28:02,505 --> 00:28:04,995
real it was an area where like

820
00:28:05,115 --> 00:28:07,245
there was very high traffic a lot

821
00:28:07,245 --> 00:28:10,005
of business people um and so even

822
00:28:10,005 --> 00:28:11,505
though i had no experience in anything

823
00:28:11,505 --> 00:28:11,745
like

824
00:28:11,775 --> 00:28:12,765
this has never worked in any kind

825
00:28:12,765 --> 00:28:14,295
of food industry at all was always

826
00:28:14,325 --> 00:28:16,455
retail you you did you drink coffee

827
00:28:16,455 --> 00:28:18,195
though unlike lauren no i didn't you

828
00:28:18,195 --> 00:28:22,635

829
00:28:22,635 --> 00:28:25,515
was it was me and the owner

830
00:28:25,515 --> 00:28:29,055

00:28:45,435 --> 00:28:48,765
the register doing everything else oh and

839
00:28:48,765 --> 00:28:50,895
so the training was very enough people

840
00:28:51,165 --> 00:28:54,675
it's not it's not yeah and the

841
00:28:54,675 --> 00:28:56,715
training was very brief and very this

842
00:28:56,715 --> 00:29:00,465
lady was very ah um very terse

843
00:29:00,465 --> 00:29:02,745
fs and she was not friendly and

844
00:29:03,165 --> 00:29:06,105

851
00:29:15,015 --> 00:29:16,545
i would think like oh i don't

853
00:29:17,955 --> 00:29:19,035

855
00:29:20,625 --> 00:29:23,085

00:30:47,905 --> 00:30:49,315
of it you know what i mean

902
00:30:49,315 --> 00:30:50,695

know if that was this i think

908
00:30:56,635 --> 00:30:58,705
this was i think she was being

909
00:30:58,705 --> 00:31:00,385
very sweet to me when i was

910
00:31:00,985 --> 00:31:03,325
completely demoralized but still willing to go

911
00:31:03,325 --> 00:31:05,725
with emasculated and of course a masculinity

912
00:31:06,265 --> 00:31:07,645
well there was another guy there watching

00:31:15,325 --> 00:31:17,125
be really good at that right now

918
00:31:17,155 --> 00:31:19,345

00:31:30,895 --> 00:31:32,245
was also good to tell a marketing

925
00:31:32,275 --> 00:31:34,015
and telemarketing job once that was the

926
00:31:34,045 --> 00:31:35,695
absolute where i was really good and

927
00:31:35,695 --> 00:31:37,195
i was great at it i got

928
00:31:37,195 --> 00:31:39,325
salesman of the month cause i'm very

929
00:31:39,325 --> 00:31:40,555
much and i think that would be

930
00:31:40,555 --> 00:31:43,525
better because you are not seeing the

931
00:31:43,525 --> 00:31:45,205
people face-to-face so if you are nervous

932
00:31:45,205 --> 00:31:46,825
you're like i'm in my bubble and

933
00:31:46,825 --> 00:31:47,785
if they hang up the hat i

934
00:31:47,785 --> 00:31:50,125
think telemarketing would be bad now because

935
00:31:50,125 --> 00:31:50,995
no one ever answers

936
00:31:51,055 --> 00:31:53,035
their phones be right well yeah being

937
00:31:53,035 --> 00:31:56,575

938
00:31:56,605 --> 00:31:57,715

939
00:31:57,715 --> 00:31:59,695

979
00:33:16,765 --> 00:33:18,205

some financial stuff a couple of years

981
00:33:20,215 --> 00:33:22,885

984
00:33:26,755 --> 00:33:28,495
was like working working out with her

985
00:33:28,705 --> 00:33:31,375

992
00:33:41,005 --> 00:33:44,215
fact that there's all this it's crazy

993
00:33:44,662 --> 00:33:45,985
kind of makes me go like wait

994
00:33:45,985 --> 00:33:48,295
a minute i'm a grown-up continue there

995
00:33:48,295 --> 00:33:49,975
are so many websites that i feel

996
00:33:49,975 --> 00:33:52,705
like are just too many untrustworthy but

997
00:33:52,705 --> 00:33:53,845

999
00:33:55,045 --> 00:33:55,165

no way he'll hold out and be

1190
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,390

1191
00:40:56,390 --> 00:40:58,280

look janey on your birthday here's a

1194
00:41:03,290 --> 00:41:06,680
topic that i would i'm very i'm

1195
00:41:06,706 --> 00:41:08,720
very excited about this topic i thought

1196
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:11,600
okay here we go this is about

1197
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:14,990
an adorable thing that my dear cheney

1198
00:41:14,994 --> 00:41:17,780
started doing out of nowhere recently oh

1199
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:20,000
my we will we make the bed

1200
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,110
together frequently

1201
00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:22,640
oh because it's just like it's just

1202
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,680
faster to do it that door everything

1203
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:26,480
is faster it's a horrible chore but

1204
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:27,860
if we do it together i love

1205
00:41:27,890 --> 00:41:29,570
having the bed made though it's coming

1206
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:30,980
in at the end it feels amazing

1207
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:32,330
but when we wash the sheets then

1208
00:41:32,330 --> 00:41:33,800
it's even more stuff that you have

1209
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,600
to yeah yeah i try to force

1210
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:37,460
me to do that with sheet he

1211
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:39,329
does it i admitted sour cheetos i

1212
00:41:39,357 --> 00:41:41,030
want to say things like he's like

1213
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:41,297
i

1214
00:41:41,333 --> 00:41:43,670
only play video games but i think

1215
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:45,680
jamie would probably express it the same

1216
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:47,930
way of me i'm bad for some

1217
00:41:47,930 --> 00:41:49,520
gonna help me i'm bad at making

1218
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:50,930
the bed so that is a collapsing

1219
00:41:51,230 --> 00:41:52,550
yeah she does it by yourself every

1220
00:41:52,550 --> 00:41:55,010
time by yourself yeah wow it's not

1221
00:41:55,130 --> 00:41:56,990
that what are you bad are straightening

1222
00:41:56,990 --> 00:42:00,380
shoemakers away and identify showings okay she

1223
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:01,460
used to be a major eighty has

1224
00:42:01,492 --> 00:42:03,014
very specific thing as well oh really

1225
00:42:03,061 --> 00:42:05,270
she hotels she used to be made

1226
00:42:05,270 --> 00:42:07,070
in hotels and so she's like it's

1227
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:08,270
it's gotta be up to that level

1228
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:10,790
like my my oh my father when

1229
00:42:10,790 --> 00:42:12,231
he wanted me to make the bed

1230
00:42:12,274 --> 00:42:13,640

1231
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:15,140
like make it be like the army

1232
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:16,370
where he like if i can just

1233
00:42:16,375 --> 00:42:17,660
order off of it and it's like

1234
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:18,980
it doesn't have to be this way

1235
00:42:19,064 --> 00:42:20,960
yeah like we're just normal people i

1236
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:21,590

1237
00:42:21,650 --> 00:42:23,840

1238
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:26,780

for you my i will say my

1387
00:47:46,460 --> 00:47:48,200
one complaint with replies is that they

1388
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:50,300
often don't come to a conclusion they

1389
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:52,100
just like presented onto facts and then

1390
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:53,990
they're like anyway who knows they move

1391
00:47:53,990 --> 00:47:55,940
on i don't love that but i

1392
00:47:55,940 --> 00:47:57,590
do understand it's it's it's difficult to

1393
00:47:57,590 --> 00:47:58,640
solve everything

1394
00:47:58,910 --> 00:48:00,800
um but they did a thing about

1395
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:02,090
that i don't know like solve they

1396
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:03,500

guy basically on the other right call

1400
00:48:09,830 --> 00:48:11,360
and like got to the bottom of

1401
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:12,920
where the call was coming from and

1402
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:14,300
what they were doing and how the

1403
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:15,590

know how to play he's trying to

1492
00:51:16,135 --> 00:51:17,425
get me to play and that's been

1493
00:51:17,425 --> 00:51:19,135
a struggle because it's a bone of

1494
00:51:19,135 --> 00:51:21,025
contention i was already named a louisville

1495
00:51:21,055 --> 00:51:22,915
want to learn and then he'll be

1496
00:51:22,915 --> 00:51:24,685
like just sit down and move pieces

1497
00:51:24,685 --> 00:51:25,825
and i'll just tell you what you're

1498
00:51:25,825 --> 00:51:26,905
doing and what's wrong or whatever then

1499
00:51:26,905 --> 00:51:27,985
i'm like i'll tell you what you're

1500
00:51:28,015 --> 00:51:28,525
doing wrong

1501
00:51:28,585 --> 00:51:29,785
yeah and then like i was playing

1502
00:51:29,785 --> 00:51:31,255
and i'm just like willy nilly moving

1503
00:51:31,255 --> 00:51:32,725
them around and then he won and

1504
00:51:32,725 --> 00:51:34,225
then i was like k and then

1505
00:51:34,255 --> 00:51:36,775
you know it's like yeah fine it's

1506
00:51:36,775 --> 00:51:39,055
not really the um you know you

1507
00:51:39,055 --> 00:51:40,495
can well yeah and you can't play

1508
00:51:40,495 --> 00:51:42,205
against a person who plays all the

1509
00:51:42,205 --> 00:51:43,945
time he's willing to teach me i'm

1510
00:51:43,945 --> 00:51:45,685
just really unwilling to learn and i

1511
00:51:45,685 --> 00:51:47,755
think it is my fault it sounds

1512
00:51:47,755 --> 00:51:48,715
like a one hundred yeah

1513
00:51:48,805 --> 00:51:51,385
yeah i like i've thought about giving

1514
00:51:51,385 --> 00:51:52,525
in and then i'm like i really

1515
00:51:52,525 --> 00:51:53,875
don't want to it's just that thing

1516
00:51:53,875 --> 00:51:55,495
of like it's not like i'm gonna

1517
00:51:55,507 --> 00:51:57,505
be playing all the time yeah it's

1518
00:51:57,505 --> 00:51:59,515
also not like like playing someone who

1519
00:51:59,515 --> 00:52:02,155
plays scrabble every day and and then

1520
00:52:02,155 --> 00:52:03,865
allowing the person to have like the

1521
00:52:03,865 --> 00:52:05,395
two letter word list that they can

1522
00:52:05,395 --> 00:52:07,675
look at or or the dictionary or

1523
00:52:07,675 --> 00:52:08,875
whatever so they can get

1524
00:52:08,875 --> 00:52:10,285
it up to speed just like chess

1525
00:52:10,285 --> 00:52:11,725

1538
00:52:35,605 --> 00:52:37,855
like fight for it so he's he's

1539
00:52:37,855 --> 00:52:39,235
a big chestnut you just want someone

1540
00:52:39,235 --> 00:52:40,315

1541
00:52:40,315 --> 00:52:41,995

1543
00:52:43,645 --> 00:52:44,815
mean yeah anytime isn't this funny is

1544
00:52:44,815 --> 00:52:46,315
playing with many plays damning any plays

1545
00:52:46,345 --> 00:52:47,755
like a handful people on the ass

1546
00:52:47,755 --> 00:52:49,315
so he should just do that why

1547
00:52:49,315 --> 00:52:51,145
subject everyone who comes into your house

1548
00:52:51,145 --> 00:52:54,055
to that sky as they often give

1549
00:52:54,055 --> 00:52:56,095
in a lot of people are like

1550
00:52:56,125 --> 00:52:57,205

1551
00:52:57,205 --> 00:52:59,395
like are you a black mirror yeah

1553
00:53:00,475 --> 00:53:01,825
person you want to talk to a

1554
00:53:01,825 --> 00:53:03,925
human being much like you in apple

1555
00:53:03,955 --> 00:53:04,465
inc

1556
00:53:05,637 --> 00:53:09,595

oh my god this is official yeah

1558
00:53:11,155 --> 00:53:11,995
i also feel like if they were

1559
00:53:11,995 --> 00:53:13,015
calling an iphone it would just say

1560
00:53:13,045 --> 00:53:14,395
apple because they would have had that

1561
00:53:14,395 --> 00:53:16,075
figured out like they wouldn't have something

1562
00:53:16,135 --> 00:53:17,605
wouldn't do that course they wouldn't but

1563
00:53:17,605 --> 00:53:19,375
i'm saying like it should say apple

1564
00:53:19,375 --> 00:53:20,155
if you want to try to trick

1565
00:53:20,155 --> 00:53:22,495

1652
00:56:41,815 --> 00:56:44,815
board game um but it's literally just

1653
00:56:44,815 --> 00:56:47,395

melon show my mom because we were

1676
00:57:40,765 --> 00:57:42,745
doing things my mom did and that

1677
00:57:42,745 --> 00:57:43,675
was something we don't i was little

1678
00:57:43,705 --> 00:57:45,085
and we had like audio because what

1679
00:57:45,085 --> 00:57:46,825
kind of things would she ask you

1680
00:57:46,825 --> 00:57:47,095
about

1681
00:57:49,495 --> 00:57:52,165
like would you rather have she would

1682
00:57:52,165 --> 00:57:53,665
make them up and stuff oh great

1683
00:57:53,695 --> 00:57:55,435
would you rather have a pink convertible

1684
00:57:55,975 --> 00:57:57,925
with a lightning streak on the side

1685
00:57:58,585 --> 00:58:00,805
or would you rather have a piece

1686
00:58:00,805 --> 00:58:01,675
of my dna

1687
00:58:03,385 --> 00:58:06,175
like a really fast bicycle with streamers

1688
00:58:06,175 --> 00:58:07,105
on it you know i mean could

1689
00:58:07,105 --> 00:58:08,515
just make up anything but i think

1690
00:58:08,515 --> 00:58:10,585
it's fun if it's like well you

1691
00:58:10,585 --> 00:58:12,055
could probably sell the car for more

1692
00:58:12,055 --> 00:58:15,355
than a bike so um that's not

1693
00:58:15,355 --> 00:58:17,725
the question but also are you wait

1832
01:04:29,950 --> 01:04:31,150
up every morning for the last five

1833
01:04:31,150 --> 01:04:31,420
years

1837
01:04:39,430 --> 01:04:42,490
know alright asked me so scott yeah

1838
01:04:44,170 --> 01:04:45,520
would you rather be

1839
01:04:48,850 --> 01:04:54,220
invisible to the people that love you

1840
01:04:54,610 --> 01:04:55,720
and that's how you find out who

1841
01:04:55,720 --> 01:04:58,150
loves you or

1842
01:05:03,370 --> 01:05:05,320
or the people you hate are invisible

1843
01:05:05,320 --> 01:05:08,260
to you but they hate you who

1844
01:05:09,700 --> 01:05:12,850
i think it would be terrible to

1845
01:05:12,850 --> 01:05:16,450
be invisible to one person in particular

1846
01:05:16,450 --> 01:05:18,340
who loves me so your mom me

1847
01:05:19,840 --> 01:05:22,330
well that would be awful and i

1848
01:05:22,330 --> 01:05:23,710
don't really care who loves me or

1849
01:05:23,710 --> 01:05:26,290
who doesn't love me so that's not

1850
01:05:26,290 --> 01:05:28,450
like an enticement the finding out part

1851
01:05:28,450 --> 01:05:31,600
of it so i guess it would

1852
01:05:31,600 --> 01:05:32,800
have to be the other one where

1853
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:34,810
like they're invisible do i still hear

1854
01:05:34,810 --> 01:05:38,920
them yeah ooh that's creepy and are

1855
01:05:38,920 --> 01:05:39,490
they whispering

1856
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:41,200
that's all they talked about how much

1857
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:42,460
they hate you and they know they're

1858
01:05:42,460 --> 01:05:44,560
invisible to me no they don't oh

1859
01:05:44,560 --> 01:05:45,820
well then i could hear what people

1860
01:05:45,820 --> 01:05:47,350
love but i don't even like knowing

1861
01:05:47,350 --> 01:05:48,820
what people think about me have you

1862
01:05:48,820 --> 01:05:50,200

crazy yeah pretty crazy that's crazy but

1866
01:05:56,680 --> 01:05:58,721
fuckin blew my mind that's so bloom

1867
01:05:58,721 --> 01:05:59,680
with every episode

1868
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:01,420
it's like the show every episode i

1869
01:06:01,450 --> 01:06:04,000
okay me so i'd say that i'd

1870
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:05,950
say the second the second right everyone

1871
01:06:05,950 --> 01:06:08,470
would pick the second ah no not

1872
01:06:08,470 --> 01:06:10,129
me i'd like much rather be invisible

1873
01:06:10,129 --> 01:06:10,450
to the people

1874
01:06:14,620 --> 01:06:15,340
alright lauren

1875
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:17,920
would you

1876
01:06:19,900 --> 01:06:23,410
like to go take a take a

1877
01:06:23,410 --> 01:06:25,570
trip to the moon with everything that

1878
01:06:25,570 --> 01:06:27,400
it entails like you'd have to train

1879
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:29,200
you'd have to play among the stars

1880
01:06:31,180 --> 01:06:32,770
um it would take you you know

1881
01:06:32,770 --> 01:06:33,880
as long as it took them and

1882
01:06:33,880 --> 01:06:36,610
all that kind of stuff okay or

1883
01:06:37,630 --> 01:06:41,020
would you or would you

1884
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:46,780
like to never achieve any more professional

1885
01:06:46,780 --> 01:06:49,060
success than you have at this moment

1886
01:06:49,060 --> 01:06:51,550
like you like basically everything dries up

1887
01:06:51,550 --> 01:06:53,740
at this moment and then you choose

1888
01:06:53,740 --> 01:06:55,660
whatever life that you would you would

1889
01:06:55,660 --> 01:06:56,980
choose if you were like oh this

1890
01:06:57,370 --> 01:06:58,780
whole thing is so either have to

1891
01:06:58,780 --> 01:07:00,130
go to the moon or everything dries

1892
01:07:00,130 --> 01:07:02,110
up yes so you're saying yeah that's

1893
01:07:02,110 --> 01:07:02,320
so

1894
01:07:02,320 --> 01:07:04,000
so that seems so grubby for me

1895
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:04,660
to be like i'll go to the

1896
01:07:04,660 --> 01:07:04,990
moon

1897
01:07:06,250 --> 01:07:07,600
but this is why it's hard to

1898
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:08,440
get to go to the moon this

1899
01:07:08,440 --> 01:07:09,460
is why it's a hard choice though

1900
01:07:09,460 --> 01:07:10,840
because like that seems like a lot

1901
01:07:10,840 --> 01:07:12,100
of work and a lot of time

1902
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:13,330
it's a lot of work but i'd

1903
01:07:13,330 --> 01:07:15,460
become so famous from it would you

1904
01:07:15,460 --> 01:07:17,110
live beyond the moon people will go

1905
01:07:17,110 --> 01:07:18,610
to the moon new go to the

1906
01:07:18,610 --> 01:07:20,050
moon who's gone to the moon since

1907
01:07:20,050 --> 01:07:21,460
that's the thing i don't even know

1908
01:07:21,850 --> 01:07:24,070
has anybody gone has anyone been to

1909
01:07:24,070 --> 01:07:25,240
the moon i don't feel like they're

1910
01:07:25,240 --> 01:07:26,320
sending people regularly

1911
01:07:26,320 --> 01:07:29,320
we know they're there not for sure

1912
01:07:29,380 --> 01:07:31,150
i honestly the host the post office

1913
01:07:31,150 --> 01:07:33,970
goes there every every year just become

1914
01:07:34,030 --> 01:07:34,540
a male

1915
01:07:36,310 --> 01:07:36,700
why

1916
01:07:37,840 --> 01:07:41,230
why are they aliens yeah the aliens

1917
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:45,370
know like i told you i actually

1918
01:07:45,400 --> 01:07:46,870
really don't want to go to outer

1919
01:07:46,870 --> 01:07:49,330
space it would be right i feel

1920
01:07:49,330 --> 01:07:50,350
like it would be frightening so i

1921
01:07:50,350 --> 01:07:51,880
think i have to accept the fact

1922
01:07:51,880 --> 01:07:54,220
that everything dries up as it is

1923
01:07:54,220 --> 01:07:55,930
and i have to get a regular

1924
01:07:55,930 --> 01:07:57,884
job i guess as a barista um

1925
01:07:57,884 --> 01:07:58,000
no

1926
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,100
no i don't say boy that same

1927
01:08:00,130 --> 01:08:02,200
point she's maxed out at her success

1928
01:08:02,200 --> 01:08:04,360
level that doesn't mean she can't continue

1929
01:08:04,360 --> 01:08:07,000
working the same job no i mean

1930
01:08:07,150 --> 01:08:08,260
i mean the cheat

1931
01:08:09,310 --> 01:08:10,990
it it all i guess what i

1932
01:08:10,990 --> 01:08:13,060
meant as everything dries that everything is

1933
01:08:13,150 --> 01:08:14,650
yeah you have to pick another dyson

1934
01:08:14,740 --> 01:08:16,510
yeah i think about that sometimes it

1935
01:08:16,510 --> 01:08:19,420
doesn't seem kind of like cool so

1936
01:08:19,420 --> 01:08:20,650
yeah let's go do something else and

1937
01:08:20,680 --> 01:08:22,360
yeah ham to worry about this bullshit

1938
01:08:22,360 --> 01:08:24,880
thing but you and and you had

1939
01:08:24,910 --> 01:08:27,430
some success nominated for an emmy and

1940
01:08:27,430 --> 01:08:29,380
then i get to me none for

1941
01:08:30,040 --> 01:08:31,420
go work at the airport right and

1942
01:08:31,420 --> 01:08:32,170
you don't have to go to the

1943
01:08:32,170 --> 01:08:33,730
moon which i actually think i don't

1944
01:08:33,730 --> 01:08:34,720
want to go to the moon enough

1945
01:08:34,720 --> 01:08:35,650
that i don't think i would want

1946
01:08:35,650 --> 01:08:37,000
to go to the tow horrible i

1947
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:38,590
would absolutely love none of them really

1948
01:08:38,620 --> 01:08:41,080
yeah just the sales and difficult force

1949
01:08:41,080 --> 01:08:43,510
and the one feel it you know

1950
01:08:43,510 --> 01:08:45,730
my favorite ride is that rye where

1951
01:08:45,730 --> 01:08:47,740
you're at to help you stand in

1952
01:08:47,740 --> 01:08:49,540
a big circle and later

1953
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:51,430
full force i went on that i

1954
01:08:51,430 --> 01:08:52,360
went on that when i was young

1955
01:08:52,360 --> 01:08:54,202

of delicate little stomach and all that

1958
01:08:59,470 --> 01:09:01,150
people would tell you about was like

2047
01:12:04,045 --> 01:12:04,825
over looking at

2048
01:12:06,745 --> 01:12:10,195
i mean people there are people certain

2049
01:12:10,195 --> 01:12:13,555
actresses who killed people in drunk driving

2050
01:12:13,705 --> 01:12:16,645
shoes and they're fine i think very

2051
01:12:16,645 --> 01:12:18,685
gayheart okay it wasn't sandy

2052
01:12:19,015 --> 01:12:21,595
matthew broader randy that's right matthew broderick

2053
01:12:22,015 --> 01:12:22,675
but

2054
01:12:24,055 --> 01:12:25,945
it does weigh on you and but

2055
01:12:25,945 --> 01:12:28,105
i feel like i always have dreams

2056
01:12:28,105 --> 01:12:31,015
where i've killed someone anyway and i

2057
01:12:31,015 --> 01:12:32,695
have to live with that guilt so

2058
01:12:32,755 --> 01:12:35,215
but just everyday waking up going oh

2059
01:12:35,215 --> 01:12:37,135
right i killed someone would be really

2060
01:12:37,135 --> 01:12:40,465
tough but you do it probably because

2061
01:12:40,465 --> 01:12:43,075
i don't want to follow right around

2062
01:12:43,315 --> 01:12:43,915
that would be worse

2063
01:12:43,975 --> 01:12:45,175
waking up every day going all i

2064
01:12:45,175 --> 01:12:46,890

the same capacity that i'm able to

2190
01:17:48,355 --> 01:17:51,415
now and communicate with people the same

2191
01:17:51,415 --> 01:17:53,575
way and i think being here's the

2192
01:17:53,575 --> 01:17:54,685
thing no one wants you to do

2193
01:17:54,685 --> 01:17:56,155
that oh they don't want me to

2194
01:17:56,155 --> 01:17:56,785
sing now

2195
01:17:57,265 --> 01:17:58,795
you have a beautiful singing voice but

2196
01:17:58,795 --> 01:17:59,755
no one taught me the thing no

2197
01:17:59,755 --> 01:18:01,075
one likes your character people like when

2198
01:18:01,675 --> 01:18:03,775
people like when using okay so now

2199
01:18:03,775 --> 01:18:05,935
i'm just a singer but not really

2200
01:18:05,935 --> 01:18:07,255
so not for a job like i'm

2201
01:18:07,255 --> 01:18:09,115
just oh you you want it to

2202
01:18:09,115 --> 01:18:12,415
be your job turns hard i think

2203
01:18:12,415 --> 01:18:14,395
i'd rather be deaf than i guess

2204
01:18:14,815 --> 01:18:15,865
how good do you think you could

2205
01:18:15,865 --> 01:18:16,165
sing

2206
01:18:17,365 --> 01:18:19,195
if i was the in this scenario

2207
01:18:19,225 --> 01:18:21,505
just right now not amazingly at all

2208
01:18:21,505 --> 01:18:24,085
it's your little no do you sing

2209
01:18:24,085 --> 01:18:27,235
the raised by tv theme yes but

2210
01:18:27,835 --> 01:18:29,755
do you do all the parts a

2211
01:18:29,755 --> 01:18:30,175
yeah

2212
01:18:31,435 --> 01:18:33,745
um but ah except for the barbecue

2213
01:18:33,745 --> 01:18:35,815
sauce at the end yes that's gateways

2214
01:18:35,905 --> 01:18:37,915
which she's doing them i feel hey

2215
01:18:37,915 --> 01:18:39,745
really yeah yeah he can't he cannot

2216
01:18:39,745 --> 01:18:41,215
carry a tune at all he knows

2217
01:18:41,245 --> 01:18:42,835
a well he hits he hits it

2218
01:18:42,835 --> 01:18:44,785
right but it's just it's too high

2219
01:18:45,715 --> 01:18:47,275
you should try to sing a song

2220
01:18:47,275 --> 01:18:49,165
with him i will in general i

2221
01:18:49,165 --> 01:18:50,815
well you should just try it just

2222
01:18:50,815 --> 01:18:51,175
try

2223
01:18:51,535 --> 01:18:53,215

01:18:53,215 --> 01:18:55,133
it but okay i put it up

2225

2226
01:18:57,385 --> 01:18:59,215
really struggling with this one i guess

2227
01:19:00,295 --> 01:19:01,460
i'm gonna have another look because i

2228
01:19:01,465 --> 01:19:02,755
guess i guess i would prefer the

2229
01:19:02,755 --> 01:19:04,015
second one so i could still do

2230
01:19:04,045 --> 01:19:04,675
comedy

2231
01:19:05,935 --> 01:19:08,215

2243
01:19:29,275 --> 01:19:31,405

2247
01:19:36,055 --> 01:19:38,335
very lame now everyone hated your comedy

2248
01:19:38,335 --> 01:19:39,565
so much they asked to be hit

2249
01:19:39,565 --> 01:19:40,855
in the head so they would all

2250
01:19:40,855 --> 01:19:41,575
have amnesia

2251
01:19:43,195 --> 01:19:43,945

2252
01:19:43,945 --> 01:19:45,715
head again and then remembered alright good
