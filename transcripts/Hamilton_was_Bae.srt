the other day okay i was talking

125
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:17,460
i had heard a little gossipy story

126
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:18,720
about someone i knew who was doing

127
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,680
much cocaine and i was like oh

128
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,030
that's so gross and i was telling

129
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:23,490
this other person ah it's really just

130
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:25,470
disappointing to me that this person was

131
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:27,450
doing cocaine because you you see it

132
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:29,550
as weakness i just think it's

133
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,070
gross to do again and then this

134
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:33,630
person that i was talking to made

135
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:34,650
me feel like i was like a

136
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:36,150
square for that like he was just

137
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:38,070
like oh it's so fun and i

138
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:40,740
was like no i don't like that

139
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:41,790
and i don't think it's cool to

140
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:43,470
do that and i'm not fun and

141
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:44,820
it's not cool but i'm not like

142
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:46,500
against all drugs or something but the

143
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,180
idea of like doing coke in a

144
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:50,160
restaurant or something like bums me out

145
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:52,680
i totally agree about cocaine it is

146
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:55,200
i'm not against i'm not a puritan

147
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,850
about drugs at all and i've done

148
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,130
various drugs but cocaine was one that

149
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:01,530
never interested me be first of all

150
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:03,600
the idea of snorting something that's part

151
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,760
of what really is rather oh yeah

152
00:06:06,256 --> 00:06:08,160
i much rather put a needle in

153
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,320
my eyeball but also

154
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,540
so any anytime i'd ever been around

155
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:14,610
anyone on coke they always seem like

156
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:17,790
such asshole yeah it just seemed it

157
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:19,680
didn't seem fun and it seemed like

158
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,020
i it seemed like it was a

159
00:06:22,025 --> 00:06:24,600
thing that high for a a type

160
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,100
of person that i didn't want i

161
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,480
think that's how i feel about ticks

162
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,040
everyone i like not i know a

163
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,390
lot people who i'm friends with who've

164
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,320
done it where i'm like that's not

165
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,790
like part of their identity but people

166
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:34,320
i know who do it a lot

167
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:37,080
i typically think are asshole yeah i

168
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:39,780
yeah i also discovered i also have

169
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:42,360
a theory about cocaine is in terms

170
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,270
of ah artistry that i think it's

171
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:50,130
it's a drug that you you that

172
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:50,640
people

173
00:06:50,683 --> 00:06:54,750
can't come back from when like creative

174
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:56,190
people is part of their creed seems

175
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:57,900
like it shears off something in your

176
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,880
brain because people i think people can

177
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,380
come back from booze like they got

178
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,840
back from heroin and still be creative

179
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,670
but people that were like hardcore coke

180
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:08,760
heads yeah it's usually music people they

181
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:10,800
they seem to have lost something when

182
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:12,810
they recover it's interesting like who i'm

183
00:07:12,810 --> 00:07:13,440
an interesting guy

184
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:16,230

dressed to the nines and and they

229
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,280
had all these people around the table

230
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,750

dawn of bottle service and it

236
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,280

i love to cook and listen to

349
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:38,910

you love turning doing coke then turning

353
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,930
on this show i'm sorry that we

354
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:51,150
killed your buzz the last ten minutes

355
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:53,070

358
00:12:55,890 --> 00:12:58,050

359
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,640
hey look i can it

360
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:08,190
papa i allow ives i think another

361
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:09,660
element of it just to kind of

362
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:12,807
add to my reasoning is it's hearing

363
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:14,880
what people who i know didn't do

364
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:16,470
those this person i'm not talking about

365
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:18,510
them but i'm saying didn't do it

366
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:20,160
really before and now we're doing a

367
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,020
lot right right it's always weird when

368
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:23,730
someone's in our forties

369
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:25,410
or something in there like oh i'm

370
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:27,060
into coke now yeah it just feels

371
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:29,160
like do that from when you're twenty

372
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,450

381
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:47,880
i was in my oils molly or

382
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,680
mbna i was in my i was

383
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,180
in my thirties the first time i

384
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:53,670
tried it because it was not i

385
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:55,890
think when i was in high school

386
00:13:55,890 --> 00:13:57,900
cool it was not a thing and

387
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,070
if it was it was like the

388
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:00,930
very beginning i don't think it was

389
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:02,850
i don't i never really heard about

390
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:04,980
it so there were some raves in

391
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,240
like eighty eight that i went to

392
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,350
that i bet people were taking i

393
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:08,910
think maybe i would see people like

394
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:11,580
ten years younger than me yeah probably

395
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:13,860
that was when you would be doing

396
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:15,990
that in high school right um and

397
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:16,050
it

398
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:18,660
it was very popular and right um

399
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,010
so i was telling the story and

400
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:21,180
the story was not about

401
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:24,330
not about the first time i tried

402
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:25,800
this drug story it was was about

403
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,840

417
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:57,270
anyways like whoa why would you it

418
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:59,910
seems like that seems really like weird

419
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:01,050
like you would already use that when

420
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:03,930
you are younger yeah it's like she

421
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:06,210
like what she is she she was

422
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,710
older than you are young no younger

423
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:09,684
than me and wouldn't let it go

424
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,880
to the point where it was like

425
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:14,310
okay now you're starting to insult me

426
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:17,430
right yeah it's like that is ridiculous

427
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:20,340
that you did that that said in

428
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:21,900
my story i'm i'm probably only talking

429
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:23,430
about one person who shouldn't do

430
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,450
cause i mean it just evolved now

431
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:29,220
i'm just saying easy to me it

432
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:31,380
all started from my feelings whether it

433
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:33,000
was the sequel to it wasn't me

434
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,770

490
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:35,940
the rules of the lip-sync where then

491
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:37,140
you had to do it for a

492
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:39,380
teacher before you went on stage so

493
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:42,120

what do you got

710
00:25:58,875 --> 00:26:00,555
we had an episode of the show

711
00:26:00,855 --> 00:26:02,715
know what where

712
00:26:04,095 --> 00:26:09,855
someone was unjustly spanked oh boy and

713
00:26:09,855 --> 00:26:11,565
i feel that there must be consequences

714
00:26:11,595 --> 00:26:14,445
yes semyon yeah or that it was

715
00:26:14,445 --> 00:26:17,325
you shoving was you don't try the

716
00:26:17,325 --> 00:26:18,255
shaggy defense here

717
00:26:19,935 --> 00:26:22,635
now we ask to convene a tribunal

718
00:26:22,725 --> 00:26:24,615
so here's what it is okay so

719
00:26:24,825 --> 00:26:26,595
so it's upon listening talk about it

720
00:26:26,595 --> 00:26:29,715
i was spanked for us for telling

721
00:26:29,715 --> 00:26:31,215
a story that i'd told on a

722
00:26:31,215 --> 00:26:33,435
different podcast and the person who spanked

723
00:26:33,435 --> 00:26:35,055
me heard it on the other podcast

724
00:26:35,295 --> 00:26:37,125
and said that i'd already told it

725
00:26:37,155 --> 00:26:39,315
and he spanked me and that person

726
00:26:40,215 --> 00:26:42,705
what happened with chevron and so there

727
00:26:42,705 --> 00:26:44,655
are a few options that lay before

728
00:26:44,655 --> 00:26:46,785
us we could a spank chevron to

729
00:26:46,785 --> 00:26:47,895
even it out but i don't want

730
00:26:47,895 --> 00:26:49,065
to do a power imbalance

731
00:26:50,325 --> 00:26:51,885
it doesn't feel right it doesn't me

732
00:26:51,945 --> 00:26:52,845
i know i want to get away

733
00:26:52,845 --> 00:26:54,345
with it um but i don't i

734
00:26:54,345 --> 00:26:55,155
don't want to do it so i

735
00:26:55,164 --> 00:26:57,315
wanna get away with it i'm saying

736
00:26:57,345 --> 00:26:58,425
you want to do it and you

737
00:26:58,425 --> 00:27:00,285
get away don't buy that probably but

738
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:01,215

739
00:27:01,215 --> 00:27:02,385
with it okay cute

make him sing something as well as

834
00:30:26,025 --> 00:30:28,065
he possibly while he squats and a

835
00:30:28,065 --> 00:30:30,045
quarter while he squats in a corner

836
00:30:30,352 --> 00:30:31,605

people the captain justified wrote and said

913
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:17,410

when when this happens we were saying

919
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:29,350
the discussion starts as that's not a

920
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:29,560
reg

921
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:31,120
killer thing that you put on sandwiches

922
00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:33,910

923
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:36,610
bond me as if we said there

924
00:33:36,610 --> 00:33:38,470

968
00:35:10,810 --> 00:35:12,280
no i don't know like there was

969
00:35:12,730 --> 00:35:14,230
when we went to the ah when

970
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:15,550
we ate with hanford by the beach

971
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:16,690

972
00:35:16,690 --> 00:35:19,090
very cool but like somebody bandai be

973
00:35:19,090 --> 00:35:21,130
twenty calls yeah but just walking around

974
00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:22,540
sydney to me was like yeah i've

975
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:23,980
been in a city i don't know

976
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:25,028
when you're on tour it's kind of

977
00:35:25,028 --> 00:35:26,590
like yeah i love the time we

978
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:28,060
had no time it's very different than

979
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:28,840
when you're traveling so

980
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,490
somewhere and you like you get to

981
00:35:30,490 --> 00:35:33,123
stay there for multiple days yes lord

982
00:35:33,123 --> 00:35:34,510
yeah all the cool thing i think

983
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:35,410
it is very hard to get the

984
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,510
flavor of the city in a day

985
00:35:37,870 --> 00:35:40,990
yeah yeah totally but it was bad

986
00:35:41,290 --> 00:35:42,730
imagine if you are a mage if

987
00:35:42,730 --> 00:35:44,800
you are going there before sydney's great

988
00:35:44,830 --> 00:35:47,230
imagine if you're from australia and then

989
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:48,880
you come here and they and you

990
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:50,560
and you're on tour and for some

991
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,155
reason you're only in van nuys and

992
00:35:52,155 --> 00:35:53,410
then you're like l a suh but

993
00:35:53,410 --> 00:35:55,210
we were in sydney i know but

994
00:35:55,210 --> 00:35:56,140
we only saw a little part of

995
00:35:56,170 --> 00:35:58,060
van nuys of australia

996
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:04,090
no i do some whenever people come

997
00:36:04,090 --> 00:36:05,140
out here to l a and they

998
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:07,360
they plan whatever they going to do

999
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:09,490
around these tourist things like rodeo drive

1000
00:36:09,490 --> 00:36:10,840
or whatever i always feel very sorry

1001
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,310
for them i know but there is

1002
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:13,300
part of it where you kind of

1003
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:15,370
have to see that and like get

1004
00:36:15,370 --> 00:36:17,170
it yeah because you can't just because

1005
00:36:17,170 --> 00:36:18,790
it was fertile ground so light can

1006
00:36:18,790 --> 00:36:19,210
be like i

1007
00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:20,710
get it like it's like you should

1008
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:23,470
l a it's a chill sprawling ridiculous

1009
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:25,030
city that like you might as well

1010
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:26,530
do a bus tour or do something

1011
00:36:26,530 --> 00:36:27,490
where you can see a lot of

1012
00:36:27,490 --> 00:36:28,960
it i don't know i don't think

1013
00:36:28,990 --> 00:36:30,310
it's the worst thing ever i will

1014
00:36:30,310 --> 00:36:32,380
also say anyone who thinks that they

1015
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:33,970
need to see rodeo drive when they

1016
00:36:33,970 --> 00:36:36,010
come here you absolutely do you definitely

1017
00:36:36,010 --> 00:36:38,740
don't so so small yeah you're gonna

1018
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:39,400
drive and wave

1019
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:41,140
yes but it's like you go it's

1020
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:44,016
such a hike fun everywhere probably that

1021
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:44,920
where it's just yeah a bunch of

1022
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:47,200
fancy stores like yeah that i can't

1023
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,910
imagine being on one of those tmc

1024
00:36:48,910 --> 00:36:50,650
buses those no no it's all i

1025
00:36:50,650 --> 00:36:52,330
can think about it would be horrible

1026
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,770
but i just follow i've said that

1027
00:36:53,770 --> 00:36:55,120
and then we were on that we

1028
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:56,560
were on that double decker bus and

1029
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:58,750
in england it was great we wrote

1030
00:36:58,750 --> 00:36:59,560
a double no i wasn't

1031
00:36:59,590 --> 00:37:01,209
no you weren't there but but cool

1032
00:37:01,210 --> 00:37:02,350
up and i took it around england

1033
00:37:02,350 --> 00:37:03,460
and i was like wow this really

1034
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:05,920
makes me like you're on vacation though

1035
00:37:05,950 --> 00:37:07,391
no no it was wrong it was

1036
00:37:07,391 --> 00:37:08,650
a tour one and then i told

1037
00:37:08,650 --> 00:37:09,940
my canford about it and he took

1038
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:11,500
it and said it was great so

1039
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:13,240
i don't know so maybe hands on

1040
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:15,190
the tour it's anybody see legacies or

1041
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:16,240
it's gonna be the best one but

1042
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,370
this is where the bombs they had

1043
00:37:18,370 --> 00:37:19,690
those bumfights and

1044
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:20,500
you think that's

1045
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:23,740
this is the famous alley where they

1046
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:25,120
had those bumfights

1047
00:37:26,290 --> 00:37:27,820
i just think tmc is not the

1048
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:29,530
most reputable there was a guy who

1049
00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:31,870
occasionally would show up outside of largo

1050
00:37:32,470 --> 00:37:34,180
in the at the by the stage

1051
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:37,780
door and cool it it depending on

1052
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,640
who the guest would be an alley

1053
00:37:39,641 --> 00:37:41,380
can be creepy oh yeah ab's that

1054
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:44,260
allie's terrifying what ali is not creepy

1055
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:45,790
yeah but that one's got a lot

1056
00:37:45,790 --> 00:37:47,650
of traffic of of people who are

1057
00:37:47,650 --> 00:37:49,450
not of their right mind they just

1058
00:37:49,450 --> 00:37:51,968
shouldn't make alleys anymore right yeah another

1059
00:37:51,968 --> 00:37:52,600
solution

1060
00:37:52,663 --> 00:37:54,100
i think there's some nice out like

1061
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:56,770
what crime alley primarily where well it

1062
00:37:56,770 --> 00:38:00,820
gave yeah chris yeller ca scientologists i

1063
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:02,020
know you know i loved her though

1064
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:03,580
in the eighties i did take sure

1065
00:38:03,610 --> 00:38:04,779
she was like summer school and he

1066
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:06,820
knew shown her role yeah she's great

1067
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:08,110
in summer school i love her and

1068
00:38:08,110 --> 00:38:11,980
cheers same loved-one cheers yeah ah i'm

1069
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:12,760
chuffed there was

1070
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:15,700
a local church i loved from chairs

1071
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:17,410
i guess alleys are good for what

1072
00:38:17,410 --> 00:38:19,870
deliveries we're talking about that's the top

1073
00:38:19,870 --> 00:38:22,450
of the lease too alleys are fine

1074
00:38:22,570 --> 00:38:25,330
in a non-major cities where you think

1075
00:38:25,330 --> 00:38:27,460
alleys should be almost suburban now there's

1076
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:29,110
the only reason to have valley is

1077
00:38:29,110 --> 00:38:30,670
in a major city or doesn't have

1078
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:32,860
alleys it doesn't have alleys no

1079
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,840
think about it well i guess people

1080
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,220
in new york are just fine blocking

1081
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:38,770
streets off like are parking there yeah

1082
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:42,340
wait so yes this guy he would

1083
00:38:42,370 --> 00:38:43,960
use from tmc and huge if i

1084
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,460
had like a fancy person on my

1085
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:48,370
show he would wait in the alley

1086
00:38:48,370 --> 00:38:49,360
for them to come out of the

1087
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,980
stage door my god and then they

1088
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:52,540
