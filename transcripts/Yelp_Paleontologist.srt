hours a day watching you just put

59
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,660
your brain in a jar but then

60
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:32,430

come back like twenty years from now

65
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,050
and be like hey i'm

66
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,910
here from my brain i would like

67
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:42,990
to put my brain in a jar

68
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:44,370
but i also like would like to

69
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:45,840
see it in the jar and i

70
00:02:45,862 --> 00:02:47,100
don't know if i could do that

71
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:48,690
if the brains in the jar but

72
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:50,700
what if it you like your brand

73
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:53,970
because he's still receiving transmissions so you

74
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:55,950
could well yeah like your brain is

75
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:58,830
still working it's just resting okay let's

76
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:00,240
see what brain oh what's the point

77
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,100
ain't that you get to feel like

78
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,480
you're sleeping what you're doing stuff so

79
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,760
what two brains yeah walking around and

80
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,770
shit yeah two brains you have a

81
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:10,920
backup brain that will register sight in

82
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,290
those like you know any sort of

83
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:14,760
ah transmissions and stuff

84
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:16,980
so that's enough for you to see

85
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:19,500
that brain in the jar but it's

86
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,940
not where you have to think all

87
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:22,860
the time that's all i want and

88
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:25,830
then righteously um speaking of two brains

89
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:27,900
do you remember how we used to

90
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,570
think or maybe that we were told

91
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:33,030
that dinosaurs some dinosaurs had two brains

92
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,190
do you remember that i remember like

93
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:35,970
having to you

94
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:36,570
spring

95
00:03:38,427 --> 00:03:40,230
ah ah wait like they were too

96
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:41,580
like they were two nuts like to

97
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:43,380
like um no they were not side

98
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:47,310
by side chestnut i don't remember like

99
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:48,720
there they had one in their head

100
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,160
and one in there bud or something

101
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:52,140
yeah like go it's in their spine

102
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:53,910
of their tail or something really remember

103
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:55,290
that yeah i remember hearing that when

104
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:56,340
i was a kid you know what

105
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:57,840
kind of not all dinosaurs but

106
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:00,210
certain dinosaurs like stegosaurus oh the double

107
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:01,500
dinosaur brain myth

108
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:04,710
yeah for decades popular articles and books

109
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:06,570
claimed that the armor plated sega sores

110
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:08,340
and the biggest of the sauropod dinosaurs

111
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,910
had second brains guys so many ads

112
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:13,200
are popping up oh guy

113
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:16,080
it's for real

114
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:17,940
i clicked out of it so i

115
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:19,560
don't know what's going on alright second

116
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:23,040
brain okay second brains and their romps

117
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,980
these dinosaurs said couldn't there lady lumps

118
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,310
these dinosaurs huh it was said could

119
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:32,130
reason a posteriori thanks to them extra

120
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:33,600
mass of tissue it was a cute

121
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,310
idea but it's totally wrong hypothesis that

122
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:36,210
actually underscores a

123
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,215
different dinosaur mystery do you want to

124
00:04:38,215 --> 00:04:40,050
know what that is yeah you may

125
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:42,270
as well here's where the dinosaur brain

126
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:46,380
expert emily buchholtz outlined the double emily

127
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:49,732
bought holes like the double brand new

128
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:52,080
lead published second edition of the complete

129
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,180
dinosaur the idea stems from the work

130
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:56,400
of nineteenth century yale paleontologist on

131
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,380
f neil charles mom sorry did you

132
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:02,070
say a yelp paleontologist yale but paul

133
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:03,060
i think you should use the name

134
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:04,740
auth neil as one of your characters

135
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:05,910
so funny you'll

136
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:09,180
in an assessment of the sauropod camara

137
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:11,760
cyrus marsh notice that the amount of

138
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:14,820
vertebrae over the dinosaurs hips and large

139
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,530
to an expanded canal that was larger

140
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:18,240
than the cavity for the dennis brains

141
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:20,160
the brain this is the most suggestive

142
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,630
fact he wrote and according to buck

143
00:05:21,642 --> 00:05:24,720
colts and eighteen eighty one more skillful

144
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:27,120
described a similar expansion

145
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:28,680
and the neural canal stegosaurus is a

146
00:05:28,682 --> 00:05:32,220
posterior brain case okay but can we

147
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:34,590
just talk about how her names like

148
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:36,450
avid hole in she's his name is

149
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:39,060
off neil it's crazy because we still

150
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:40,290
go out every year it feels like

151
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:42,000
they're like this dennis who actually was

152
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,460
covered in feathers and we yeah yeah

153
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,770
i don't know showers doing something or

154
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:47,150
maybe some of

155
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:49,350
fur we were taught about that yeah

156
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:50,760
they're going to find out is that

157
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,740
there's no such thing as dinosaurs and

158
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:54,240
the earth is only five thousand years

159
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,490
old yes i love that you guys

160
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:59,760
believe that thank you it's so fun

161
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:02,250
to show different perspectives what i remember

162
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:03,420
as a kid thinking how good they

163
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:06,090
have if they had two brains what

164
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:06,870
would the other brain

165
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:09,900
yeah what's the other brain controlling yeah

166
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:11,730
and now i'm relieved to find out

167
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:13,110
that it doesn't make any sense and

168
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:14,670
of course it enough to brains is

169
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:16,830
is the size of the brain the

170
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:18,540
thing that makes you smarter because that's

171
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:19,860
what i always heard his motion of

172
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:20,310
the ocean

173
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:23,280
but i had always heard like oh

174
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,601
dinosaurs yeah they were big but they

175
00:06:24,601 --> 00:06:26,280
had tiny pea-sized brains that's why they

176
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,030
weren't smart

177
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:33,000
almost fine yeah i thought they were

178
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,050
willfully ignorant

179
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:36,990
they were just like i don't want

180
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:39,150
to learn this yeah just wanna go

181
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:41,400
see an effect highly common sense

182
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,370
i got a lot of dinosaurs sense

183
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:46,140
i never heard their brains were that

184
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:48,360
small i don't know why i heard

185
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:51,150
that but i did and i couldn't

186
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:52,410
tell you why but i could tell

187
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:54,930
you that there is no clear correlation

188
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:57,840
between absolut early brain size and intelligence

189
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:00,480
assuming that absolutely brain size decisive for

190
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,430
intelligence than whales or elephants should be

191
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:02,610
more

192
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,680
intelligent than humans and horses more intelligent

193
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,720
than chimpanzees which definitely is not the

194
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,510
case yeah oh fuck sorry horses you're

195
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:12,660
damn dunk i saw a roast or

196
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:15,690
video of this elephant doing a show

197
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:17,940
i saw an elephant elephant doing a

198
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:20,910
joke this hand took the hat off

199
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:22,320
the woman portrait

200
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,300
both and then she's like you may

201
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26,280
have that anyway and put her back

202
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,380
on her head i challenge him i

203
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:29,760
tried to enjoy a similar thing like

204
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:30,960
that where an elephant played a little

205
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,580
prank on somebody might have been the

206
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:34,440
exact same thing some other one after

207
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,060
i saw that spicy nolan and then

208
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,380
of course a bunch of people are

209
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:39,630
like that elephant has been cruelly trained

210
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,580
i knew that had to be the

211
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:42,750
fucking deal

212
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:45,630
i can't remember that video and socks

213
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:49,080
we've right it's like i yeah of

214
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,730
course elephants aren't just going to naturally

215
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:52,530
do that i guess but it's still

216
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:54,420
i thought it might be smart enough

217
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:56,550
to do that i think they're smart

218
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:00,000
we've talked to like elephants we talked

219
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,550
about the video about the elephant backing

220
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:05,040
up and the guy sweeping his cage

221
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:05,820
and we talked about that

222
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:08,670
that doesn't mean guy guy sweeping up

223
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:11,040
the elephant's cage he's just minding his

224
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,260
own business this elephant backs up in

225
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:14,670
the guy's head gets stuck in the

226
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:17,520
elephant's butt hole we never talked about

227
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,850
this okay so it sounds like colts

228
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:24,060
and backs his buck colts up in

229
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:25,680
this guy's head gets stuck in it

230
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:27,120
and he pops it out in immune

231
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:27,990
really bars

232
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:33,360
ah sassy

233
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:36,750
i mean that makes sense i guess

234
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:39,060
i mean i do if we've talked

235
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,470
about elephants i've definitely said this but

236
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,630
i just always remember and this isn't

237
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,280
as good as that by any means

238
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,270
but when i was little i went

239
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:46,710
to the zoo and they had a

240
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:48,930
video the elephant was the elephant cage

241
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:52,230
was empty at lincoln park zoo and

242
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:54,120
then there was a small tv hanging

243
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:54,960
in the corner of the

244
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:56,400
cage and it had a video playing

245
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,930
over and over of this elephant giving

246
00:08:57,930 --> 00:08:59,910
birth and the the elephants come out

247
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:02,459
in a full sack and then oh

248
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:02,940
wow

249
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,340
and it just plops onto the ground

250
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,140
maybe that's it but i did think

251
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:08,130
about that when i was in labor

252
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:09,390
because there was a point where my

253
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:10,770
water hadn't broken and they said the

254
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:12,180
baby can be born with the water

255
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,530
being broken then i was like wow

256
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:15,210
like oh yeah i forgot what the

257
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:17,640
term is yeah for that there's a

258
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,290
classic term it's crazy to see a

259
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:21,420
video of a human baby with that

260
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:22,947
where they did the sun doesn't break

261
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:23,760
whatever and they come out

262
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,077
and then they pop the second on

263
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,340
the baby's ah

264
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,760
a way with they just had a

265
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,520
tv in the zoo so yeah zoo

266
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:35,760
for tds yeah one way to get

267
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,010
around oh life like animals must be

268
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:40,530
so expensive yeah just jeebies i mean

269
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:42,810
but tv tell you how small the

270
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:44,820
spaces are for the animals actually yeah

271
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:46,440
you're an adult and you realize like

272
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:47,670
oh they didn't have more room back

273
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:48,240
there and this is

274
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:49,920
actually really sad like when the like

275
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,710
bigger bigger cats are like pacing back

276
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:55,410
and forth like oh dressing room i

277
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:57,570
remember going to i used to love

278
00:09:57,570 --> 00:09:58,380
going to zoo when i was a

279
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:00,420
kid philadelphia zoo all zoo in the

280
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:03,930
country went to the la zoo and

281
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:08,307
it destroyed zoos for me forever yes

282
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,730
like the like there is no philadelphia

283
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:13,020
wonder is it really cool because it's

284
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:14,160
old and have a made a lot

285
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,080
of improvements i mean like i haven't

286
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,370
been there in forever but i can

287
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:18,540
tell you i remember going in the

288
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:20,250
reptile house and there was a big

289
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:23,190
ah sea turtle who was just like

290
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:26,160
pressed up against the glass like throw

291
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,630
my house right out of the water

292
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,070
yeah he's put him up

293
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:29,760
glass

294
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:33,240
tits up yeah and it was just

295
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,250
like well that can't be this as

296
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:38,700
this animal's not thriving right yeah i

297
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,620
remember like at the lincoln park zoo

298
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:42,720
there's a lot of gorillas and they

299
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,820
would there was always a moment because

300
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:46,500
a lot to you how many growers

301
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,150
is alive i mean i know that's

302
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:50,790
a lotta yard i think

303
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:52,830
in chicago i think that's a lot

304
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:55,320
oh so you'll know you're quantifying it

305
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:58,350
by location because twenty two is like

306
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:00,690
huge and twenty five twenty five to

307
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:02,040
me is like a lot of gorillas

308
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,560
but five items in three

309
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:10,110
but this gorilla would always go up

310
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:13,560
and bash his arms against the glass

311
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:15,120
sheet and when you're a little kid

312
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:17,100
everyone goes like run away and said

313
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,810
it was crazy and that's like that's

314
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:21,960
fucked up ultimately that's bleak as hell

315
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,340
away but should they what do you

316
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:24,750
want him to be like running around

317
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:25,650
on the five freeway

318
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,960
well i'd rather he didn't see alternative

319
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:30,840
yes either is on the five or

320
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,100
because he can't they they take him

321
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,030
to california but put them on the

322
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:35,160

then yes one one role and they

383
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:47,640
did really well and then that was

384
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:47,850
it

385
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,070

00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:57,660
charles cosmo i saw one of those

390
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:00,180
buzzfeed articles or maybe it wasn't buzzfeed

391
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:02,310
and i'm but some other place that

392
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:04,650
was like these actors did a great

393
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:06,660
job but then never worked again or

394
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:08,220
they walked away from show business

395
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,510
and then i click on it's all

396
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:11,370
people who obviously just couldn't get another

397
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:14,100
part you know like so now that's

398
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:15,810

00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,230
got another role again and that's like

403
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:24,330
just strangely we never heard from them

404
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:26,790

ah wow and i almost googled them

456
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,240
but i was on the plane so

457
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,920
i couldn't i never pay for wi-fi

458
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,180
on the plane i i used my

459
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,250
time off but it should be included

460
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:26,520
in planes it should be included yeah

461
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:27,960
candles should be at this time because

462
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,280
now it's like twenty dollars

463
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:31,380
like to it's my addiction that i

464
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:32,700
need to pay twenty dollars to go

465
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,710
online you know do it it's the

466
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:36,780
chasm between people who can't afford it

467
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:38,610
and can't is so vast it's not

468
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:40,290
like yeah it's not like it's easy

469
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:42,510
okay five dollars you can have wi-fi

470
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,880
it's a now it's a thirty dollar

471
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:47,790
thanks guys it's a should make sure

472
00:16:47,795 --> 00:16:49,200
just here because then everyone would do

473
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:49,560
it and they get

474
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:52,560
more money i feel like hotels it's

475
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,200
gotten it's gotten cheaper or free now

476
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:56,790
yeah because it used to be like

477
00:16:57,330 --> 00:16:59,400
oh well if you send your computer

478
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,320
and it's free but a wi-fi that's

479
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,990
technology that costs so much i think

480
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:06,210
it's like so rude to make wi-fi

481
00:17:06,210 --> 00:17:07,980
costs something in a hotel that's like

482
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:09,660
just yeah really well also there

483
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:12,030
should be free wi-fi across all cities

484
00:17:12,090 --> 00:17:14,430
as well why if i find any

485
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:16,680
free everywhere there there are certain i

486
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:19,440
thought santa ah san francisco rather had

487
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,210
that for awhile where it's like free

488
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:23,100
wi-fi across the entire city and they

489
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:24,930
were like the infrastructure was like that

490
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:26,730
yeah it's a great idea because it's

491
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:27,000
like

492
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:30,060
everyone needs it now and so there

493
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:32,670
shouldn't be you know a barrier for

494
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:34,260
people who have less money to be

495
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:36,420
online well i think i think we

496
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:38,730
should have to pay for everything because

497
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:41,010
it's the market the free market and

498
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:43,050
if you earn like cars public of

499
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:46,620
california then go right ahead but i

500
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:48,360
like to pay for things

501
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:51,360
if i get sick i want to

502
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,150
rack up thousands and thousands of dollars

503
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:55,980

00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:57,660
on the threesome tweet

505
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:00,930

okay about that experience you're not hearing

530
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,790
a lot about people getting sick on

531
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:14,430
planes mainly scary killarney kickoff all the

532
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:16,950
maskey weirdos who are like yeah i'm

533
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:18,900
wearing a song instead i got i

534
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:21,240
watched the most fucking annoying man

535
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,980
and yesterday or or away this was

536
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:24,240
a couple of days to me please

537
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,590
don't be me playing too hard it's

538
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:28,080
me isn't it hopefully something so his

539
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,310
name was scott paul

540
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:33,630
ou um jake p this guy so

541
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:35,100
like everyone in the airport is wearing

542
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,780
a mask except for some people will

543
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:38,430
pull it down just to be annoying

544
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:39,420
i think like if you're eating a

545
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:40,890
time but there's people who are just

546
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:43,230
clearly trying to not wear it yeah

547
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,550
but whatever once you're on the plane

548
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:47,640
it's enforced so but it's also suggested

549
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,620
in the airport and desired by most

550
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:50,520
people because there's a boy

551
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,740
million people walking around with their covert

552
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:57,300
houses but um this guy of course

553
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:59,760
he was one of yours guys he

554

638
00:22:17,585 --> 00:22:19,235

00:22:25,355 --> 00:22:27,155
thing though i feel like i've seen

642
00:22:27,155 --> 00:22:28,295
things online where people will say that

643
00:22:28,295 --> 00:22:29,075
people did

644
00:22:29,585 --> 00:22:31,535
protest taking their shoes off in the

645
00:22:31,535 --> 00:22:34,605

you think so yeah i mean there's

762
00:26:34,655 --> 00:26:36,245
certain things that pop up that i'm

763
00:26:36,395 --> 00:26:38,105
but here's the thing if you forget

764
00:26:38,105 --> 00:26:40,505
about those things you might relive them

765
00:26:41,315 --> 00:26:42,424
or you might relive them or it

766
00:26:42,424 --> 00:26:45,665
might it might chip away at the

767
00:26:45,725 --> 00:26:48,275
the person that you are now because

768
00:26:48,275 --> 00:26:49,715
even gotten no experience

769
00:26:49,715 --> 00:26:49,955
nsw

770
00:26:51,155 --> 00:26:51,995
yeah that's true

771
00:26:53,735 --> 00:26:57,425
yeah like anything bad happened without having

772
00:26:57,425 --> 00:26:59,405
to look cooler that you wanted to

773
00:26:59,405 --> 00:27:01,235
forget then yeah he did forget it

774
00:27:01,235 --> 00:27:02,675
that he might not have empathy towards

775
00:27:02,675 --> 00:27:04,205
people who experienced that bad thing or

776
00:27:04,205 --> 00:27:08,225
something i sometimes wonder like if i

777
00:27:08,255 --> 00:27:09,725
if i hadn't had the experiences that

778
00:27:09,725 --> 00:27:11,765
i had when i was younger would

779
00:27:11,765 --> 00:27:13,235
i have ended up in common

780
00:27:13,235 --> 00:27:15,455
a i know i know what i

781
00:27:15,455 --> 00:27:17,345
mean i think it's better like if

782
00:27:17,345 --> 00:27:19,835
you had to relive your life you

783
00:27:19,835 --> 00:27:21,425
should just do a totally different one

784
00:27:22,145 --> 00:27:25,355
i think i want to forget anything

785
00:27:25,415 --> 00:27:27,005
i wouldn't want to forget anything i

786
00:27:27,005 --> 00:27:28,085
mean there are things i would forget

787
00:27:28,085 --> 00:27:28,985
i wanna forget i guess but i

788
00:27:28,985 --> 00:27:30,328
wouldn't want for anything from childhood cause

789
00:27:30,328 --> 00:27:31,505
i feel like yeah that shapes you

790
00:27:31,745 --> 00:27:33,245
but then there's a couple adult things

791
00:27:33,245 --> 00:27:33,365
that

792
00:27:33,495 --> 00:27:34,535
like it'd be great to not have

793
00:27:34,535 --> 00:27:36,545
experienced that or not remember there are

794
00:27:36,545 --> 00:27:38,705

883
00:30:58,925 --> 00:31:00,875

884
00:31:00,875 --> 00:31:03,485

to her house where she's she's already

896
00:31:33,755 --> 00:31:35,675
to give birth and then they like

897
00:31:36,305 --> 00:31:38,795
open up a flap in the stomach

898
00:31:40,265 --> 00:31:42,665
and like like part it like this

899
00:31:42,965 --> 00:31:44,735
like it's two saloon doors in a

900
00:31:44,795 --> 00:31:47,555
in a old western town and there's

901
00:31:47,555 --> 00:31:49,115
an eight year old inside

902
00:31:50,735 --> 00:31:53,735
and i'm like wait was this baby

903
00:31:53,735 --> 00:31:55,415
in you for eight years and it

904
00:31:55,415 --> 00:31:57,875
was like no that baby has been

905
00:31:59,075 --> 00:32:01,145
outside but we thought it needed a

906
00:32:01,145 --> 00:32:05,195
little more time inside because to develop

907
00:32:05,195 --> 00:32:06,905
so we we put it so we

908
00:32:06,905 --> 00:32:09,185
put it back in and now now

909
00:32:09,185 --> 00:32:11,525
it's already and then they pulled it

910
00:32:11,525 --> 00:32:14,225
out of the stomach and then these

911
00:32:14,225 --> 00:32:16,500
ah yeah and it was eight years

912
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:18,725

00:32:21,575 --> 00:32:22,805
long time but yeah but there's a

916
00:32:22,805 --> 00:32:24,425
lot of metaphor

00:32:40,475 --> 00:32:41,615
think that metaphor is lower

924
00:32:42,695 --> 00:32:45,935
i think two things one it could

925
00:32:45,935 --> 00:32:48,275
be you thinking about you know your

926
00:32:48,275 --> 00:32:51,185
plans for your family and the things

927
00:32:51,455 --> 00:32:53,075
and maybe you've been thinking about this

928
00:32:53,075 --> 00:32:54,305
for a long time so it feels

929
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:56,285
like a eight year old child

930
00:32:58,325 --> 00:33:01,625
or it could be that you want

931
00:33:01,625 --> 00:33:02,983
to see a little kid burst up

932
00:33:05,135 --> 00:33:08,705
ah

933
00:33:10,145 --> 00:33:15,725
ah that could be yeah is joe

934
00:33:15,725 --> 00:33:18,365
rogan everybody joe is joe rogan um

935
00:33:18,395 --> 00:33:19,505
anyway for the first time in a

936
00:33:19,505 --> 00:33:20,045
long time

937
00:33:21,155 --> 00:33:22,385
how did you feel when you woke

938
00:33:22,385 --> 00:33:24,275
up ah well it was one of

939
00:33:24,275 --> 00:33:25,925
those dreams well first of all okay

940
00:33:25,925 --> 00:33:27,035
it was also i saw this person

941
00:33:27,035 --> 00:33:28,655
at a party and and we had

942
00:33:28,955 --> 00:33:30,365
you know how you have very vivid

943
00:33:30,365 --> 00:33:32,945
dreams when you drink quite a bit

944
00:33:32,975 --> 00:33:34,295
you know what i mean and it's

945
00:33:34,295 --> 00:33:36,245
like you're not sleeping all that well

946
00:33:36,575 --> 00:33:38,435
because you're sort of like going to

947
00:33:38,435 --> 00:33:40,625
be hung over and your dehydrator or

948
00:33:40,625 --> 00:33:41,225
whatever and

949
00:33:41,315 --> 00:33:43,535
and yet you're having these vivid ass

950
00:33:43,535 --> 00:33:45,245
dreams that you remember it was like

951
00:33:45,245 --> 00:33:46,445
the first thing that i thought of

952
00:33:46,445 --> 00:33:47,435
when i woke up and i was

953
00:33:47,435 --> 00:33:49,715
like oh that was weird but it

954
00:33:49,865 --> 00:33:51,548
all made sense of course when you're

955
00:33:51,785 --> 00:33:52,925
a time of like oh yes of

956
00:33:52,925 --> 00:33:54,755

00:33:59,735 --> 00:34:00,845
you don't want to see my saloon

961
00:34:00,845 --> 00:34:01,385
flaps open

962
00:34:01,385 --> 00:34:02,345

963
00:34:02,345 --> 00:34:04,235

964
00:34:04,235 --> 00:34:06,455
be outside when they're not ready yeah

965
00:34:06,455 --> 00:34:08,405

974
00:34:38,795 --> 00:34:39,815

express to toot

981
00:34:52,595 --> 00:34:54,335
when they're listening to your family listen

982
00:34:54,335 --> 00:34:57,395
to them go to a audio table

983
00:34:57,395 --> 00:34:58,655

984
00:34:58,655 --> 00:35:00,245
it was a book first right yeah

985
00:35:00,245 --> 00:35:01,835

988
00:35:07,685 --> 00:35:09,815

because he had a scary dream is

1162
00:41:49,425 --> 00:41:51,285

1163
00:41:51,315 --> 00:41:53,325

1164
00:41:53,325 --> 00:41:54,645

1165
00:41:54,645 --> 00:41:56,265
talk about his dreams that will be

1166
00:41:56,445 --> 00:41:58,815
interesting for sure did you find dream

1167
00:41:58,815 --> 00:42:02,055
depot boring call i never did i

1168
00:42:02,055 --> 00:42:03,405
look i one of the people i

1169
00:42:03,405 --> 00:42:04,635
liked your people's dreams if they have

1170
00:42:04,635 --> 00:42:06,615
a weird dream i like to hear

1171
00:42:06,615 --> 00:42:08,981
it it's like that's all just because

1172
00:42:08,985 --> 00:42:10,785
your dream doesn't make it uninteresting no

1173
00:42:10,785 --> 00:42:11,415
that's true i think

1174
00:42:11,478 --> 00:42:13,515
you have a problem we've started to

1175
00:42:13,515 --> 00:42:15,915
say like that people should never tell

1176
00:42:15,915 --> 00:42:18,135
their dreams because of that like it's

1177
00:42:18,135 --> 00:42:19,425
kind of become this thing of like

1178
00:42:19,455 --> 00:42:21,225
you should literally never say that you

1179
00:42:21,225 --> 00:42:22,755
had a dream yeah i mean it's

1180
00:42:22,815 --> 00:42:25,215
very foundation the dream depot was based

1181
00:42:25,215 --> 00:42:26,895
upon i tell you what i wouldn't

1182
00:42:26,895 --> 00:42:28,125
have dreamed depot if we didn't have

1183
00:42:28,125 --> 00:42:30,525
dreams dreams didn't exist there would be

1184
00:42:30,525 --> 00:42:31,605
no dream depot i thought

1185
00:42:31,605 --> 00:42:34,275
think my rest my case yeah if

1186
00:42:34,275 --> 00:42:35,895
dreams didn't exist there'd be a dream

1187
00:42:35,895 --> 00:42:37,725
depot which means thusly you would never

1188
00:42:37,725 --> 00:42:39,225
have bought the train whistle which you

1189
00:42:39,255 --> 00:42:40,272
never would be able to use and

1190
00:42:40,272 --> 00:42:42,795
no one have ever invented trains if

1191
00:42:42,795 --> 00:42:45,135
i didn't have this train whistle dream

1192
00:42:45,135 --> 00:42:48,045
depot never would have happened ah yes

1193
00:42:48,435 --> 00:42:50,595
thank you um but i think that

1194
00:42:50,625 --> 00:42:51,730
yeah i think it's become

1195
00:42:51,795 --> 00:42:54,675
thing i would rather hear somebody describe

1196
00:42:54,765 --> 00:42:56,914
even a boring dream than somebody telling

1197
00:42:56,914 --> 00:42:58,575
me something in a really exciting thing

1198
00:42:58,575 --> 00:43:01,095
that happened in real life yeah i

1199
00:43:01,095 --> 00:43:03,435
don't want to hear anything real exam

1200
00:43:03,945 --> 00:43:06,225
got your ride my bike that's exactly

1201
00:43:06,225 --> 00:43:06,405
what i

1202
00:43:08,655 --> 00:43:10,785
i would rather have somebody describe a

1203
00:43:10,785 --> 00:43:12,195
dull dream to me then tell me

1204
00:43:12,195 --> 00:43:13,965
what they thought something said when they

1205
00:43:13,965 --> 00:43:16,450
first looked at it i hate that

1206
00:43:16,455 --> 00:43:17,655
well that to me is like that's

1207
00:43:17,655 --> 00:43:19,605
just in your head that's not that's

1208
00:43:19,635 --> 00:43:22,185
only amusing tuesday that it didn't mean

1209
00:43:22,215 --> 00:43:23,475
anything to me when yeah that's what

1210
00:43:23,475 --> 00:43:25,425
you thought it said it doesn't say

1211
00:43:25,425 --> 00:43:27,285
that i've had that experience where i

1212
00:43:27,315 --> 00:43:27,525
thought

1213
00:43:27,555 --> 00:43:29,205
something said something it didn't say and

1214
00:43:29,205 --> 00:43:30,735
then it was amusing to me it's

1215
00:43:30,735 --> 00:43:31,995
not abusing anyone else i know it's

1216
00:43:31,995 --> 00:43:33,705

00:43:40,125 --> 00:43:41,565
they just think i said a different

1221

thank you if they think i said

1222
00:43:42,765 --> 00:43:44,175
like a different joke that i said

00:43:59,925 --> 00:44:03,225
a boyfriend who would read every every

1232
00:44:03,225 --> 00:44:04,905
billboard that they ever passed when they

1233
00:44:04,905 --> 00:44:07,215
were driving that's so annoying

1234
00:44:08,505 --> 00:44:11,805
that's like a disorder just like because

1235
00:44:11,805 --> 00:44:13,365
it was so boring and just trying

1236
00:44:13,365 --> 00:44:14,865
to fill the time just like yeah

00:44:15,615 --> 00:44:18,525

like just take something to talk about

1243
00:44:29,055 --> 00:44:30,885
our own talk just shut us it's

1244
00:44:30,915 --> 00:44:33,225
when people are that uncomfortable with silence

1245
00:44:33,435 --> 00:44:36,645
it's very um it's it's it's hard

1246
00:44:36,645 --> 00:44:38,055
to deal with i bet he wishes

1247
00:44:38,055 --> 00:44:39,915
that they had podcasts whenever that happened

1248
00:44:41,145 --> 00:44:41,805
right

1249
00:44:43,545 --> 00:44:44,745
you know what i was thinking oh

1250
00:44:44,745 --> 00:44:49,179
you're uncomfortable silence israeli sad is it

1251
00:44:49,185 --> 00:44:50,565

1252
00:44:50,637 --> 00:44:52,965

1285
00:46:01,665 --> 00:46:02,985
funny they are like the doughboys are

1286
00:46:02,985 --> 00:46:04,365

1287
00:46:04,365 --> 00:46:04,965

1296
00:46:22,335 --> 00:46:23,745
i thought that was just his personality

1297
00:46:23,775 --> 00:46:24,525

00:46:25,125 --> 00:46:27,408

that described the plot of a movie

1330
00:47:39,075 --> 00:47:40,695
using the movie title as the spine

alrighty

1422
00:52:07,010 --> 00:52:08,721
i'm gonna try another one alright people

1423
00:52:08,721 --> 00:52:10,850
with the character and the actor that

1424
00:52:10,970 --> 00:52:14,090
that doesn't happen a lot no usually

1425
00:52:14,090 --> 00:52:16,460
a character lives on when a movie's

1426
00:52:16,460 --> 00:52:18,950
done actor exactly if the actor dies

1427
00:52:18,980 --> 00:52:20,510
but the character doesn't die in the

1428
00:52:20,510 --> 00:52:22,250
movie the character is still alive yeah

1429
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:26,000
and and more movies should end with

1430
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:26,720
every character die

1431
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:28,520
dying so that it equals out just

1432
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:30,860
to be safe yes yeah but unfortunately

1433
00:52:30,860 --> 00:52:33,890
most actors die before characters do yeah

1434
00:52:34,370 --> 00:52:37,040
