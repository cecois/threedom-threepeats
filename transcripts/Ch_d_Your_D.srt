60
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:32,280

00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:36,450
in one guy hit him once in

64
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:37,680

65
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,190
shattered every bone in his chat and

66
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:43,740
and made and he needed reconstructive surgery

67
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:45,630
and his eye kind of drooped a

68
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:47,610
little bit and i was like this

69
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:49,740
is i mean the the anytime you

70
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:51,600
see someone getting hit in movies it's

71
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,150
usually like to knock someone out or

72
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:56,100
people are just hitting each other or

73
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:57,840
something you know but no nothing ever

what started started with this that's okay

167
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,900
it started with this it started with

168
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:05,280
ah crab apples

169
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:07,500
there was a a house up the

170
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,700
street from us that had a crab

171
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:11,220
apple that's trained gigantic crab apple tree

172
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,640
and so we would throw that's grandma

173
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,945
apple isn't gonna kill someone right from

174
00:06:16,945 --> 00:06:18,630
wrong i'll say swerve not that people

175
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:19,770
should be throwing anything at a car

176
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:21,360
but i'm saying a rock is much

177
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:23,730
more dangerous than a crab yes canned

178
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:26,280
crab apple will be hard yeah i

179
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,170
guess i guess it's mushi crab apple

180
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:31,620
musashi countries myself did you say moose

181
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:33,540

182
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:34,590
mushi i didn't say for real

183
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:37,320
yeah just making sure it's for burning

184
00:06:37,336 --> 00:06:40,080
that's not how i say martius obviously

185
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:41,580
that's not how i say mushi

186
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,930

325
00:11:43,845 --> 00:11:44,655
to people but it was more like

326
00:11:44,655 --> 00:11:45,795
the swim team would do that kind

327
00:11:45,795 --> 00:11:46,815
of shit to each other i don't

328
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:48,375
know why typical swim team and my

329
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:50,985
cousin used to do these kind of

330
00:11:50,985 --> 00:11:52,215
pranks with her friends a lot and

331
00:11:52,215 --> 00:11:53,955
they would like put hot dogs on

332
00:11:54,015 --> 00:11:56,625
plastic forks filling the whole lawn all

333
00:11:56,625 --> 00:11:58,725
these animals would come and like eat

334
00:11:58,755 --> 00:12:01,185
them over night went wow what was

335
00:12:01,185 --> 00:12:04,005
the chevron sort of tune yeah hotdog

336
00:12:04,455 --> 00:12:06,275
all that and you just like that

337
00:12:06,285 --> 00:12:08,685
identify tongues in plastic forks sticking out

338
00:12:08,685 --> 00:12:11,235
of this little grass oh in order

339
00:12:11,235 --> 00:12:13,215
to elevate them yes so there's the

340
00:12:13,365 --> 00:12:15,225
caucus the helium stick a hotdog on

341
00:12:15,225 --> 00:12:16,305
top of it and then got it

342
00:12:16,335 --> 00:12:17,415
all these animals come and eat it

343
00:12:17,415 --> 00:12:18,885
overnight so we're talking dog

344
00:12:18,885 --> 00:12:22,051
dogs cats others raccoons coons what's the

345
00:12:22,185 --> 00:12:24,705
opossum the squirrels what's the point though

346
00:12:24,705 --> 00:12:25,815
for when you come out in the

347
00:12:25,815 --> 00:12:27,945
morning there are no hotdogs there well

348
00:12:27,945 --> 00:12:30,345
i just think my dogs know and

349
00:12:30,475 --> 00:12:32,325
you go to thinking deal with all

350
00:12:32,325 --> 00:12:34,065
the animals and so then there would

351
00:12:34,065 --> 00:12:35,715
be a lot being torn up or

352
00:12:35,715 --> 00:12:38,388
lie okay but like then they also

353
00:12:38,388 --> 00:12:38,955
would do with a

354
00:12:39,075 --> 00:12:40,905
like flamingos all over someone's lawn but

355
00:12:40,905 --> 00:12:41,895
this was more of like i think

356
00:12:41,895 --> 00:12:43,035
once they're getting older and they would

357
00:12:43,035 --> 00:12:44,115
like have the money for

358
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:46,425
so i'm just cry

359
00:12:47,295 --> 00:12:51,405
yeah that legitimately scared you something about

360
00:12:51,405 --> 00:12:52,905
it was really good idea

361
00:12:55,095 --> 00:12:56,595
someone came in and did and i

362
00:12:56,595 --> 00:12:58,545
didn't feel like i heard anything and

363
00:12:58,545 --> 00:13:01,005
then suddenly someone came in to deliver

364
00:13:01,035 --> 00:13:02,865
my jacket to me which i'd left

365
00:13:03,495 --> 00:13:05,625
my previous location got it and was

366
00:13:05,625 --> 00:13:07,515
right behind you and paul pointed and

367
00:13:07,515 --> 00:13:08,475
you turned around and that was a

368
00:13:08,475 --> 00:13:12,765
legitimate screen smile on my face yeah

369
00:13:12,765 --> 00:13:14,085
it wasn't like a horrified life

370
00:13:16,035 --> 00:13:16,455

532
00:18:45,585 --> 00:18:48,375
that well i don't know what do

533
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:50,025
you have anything important in there you

534
00:18:50,055 --> 00:18:51,675
know i've i've started i've ticked up

535
00:18:51,675 --> 00:18:53,265
my ipod which is the only important

536
00:18:53,265 --> 00:18:55,125
thing now i'm wondering

537
00:18:56,685 --> 00:18:59,775
if you're saying that a thing that

538
00:18:59,775 --> 00:19:01,725
you talked about before it happened again

539
00:19:01,935 --> 00:19:03,855
if someone heard it on the show

540
00:19:03,855 --> 00:19:04,785
and goes and tries to do it

541
00:19:04,785 --> 00:19:08,385
now no oh well i live i

542
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:10,665
thought that i'm saying does that count

543
00:19:10,725 --> 00:19:12,825
as a spangle offense know the first

544
00:19:12,825 --> 00:19:15,495
part was definitely not bankable saying saying

545
00:19:15,495 --> 00:19:16,485
that this happened to me

546
00:19:16,485 --> 00:19:18,375
me the other night look and then

547
00:19:18,405 --> 00:19:19,785
you guys were so confused and i

548
00:19:19,785 --> 00:19:22,185
was i was intentionally not saying what

549
00:19:22,185 --> 00:19:24,645
it was trial by fire

550
00:19:26,505 --> 00:19:28,095
whatever is what does this tell my

551
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:30,315
jury is that right what i don't

552
00:19:30,315 --> 00:19:31,815
know what you're talking about people i

553
00:19:31,845 --> 00:19:34,095
know so why can't you just decide

554
00:19:34,245 --> 00:19:35,775
that someone is wrong and then we

555
00:19:35,775 --> 00:19:37,515
go for them because look yesterday i

556
00:19:38,055 --> 00:19:40,005
mean you banked when i didn't have

557

we would drive around ah and we

699
00:24:38,495 --> 00:24:40,955
would if we saw construction equipment we

700
00:24:40,955 --> 00:24:42,035

701
00:24:42,035 --> 00:24:44,225
put it on his front porch so

702
00:24:44,225 --> 00:24:45,245

those those pranks where someone does it

759
00:26:58,295 --> 00:26:59,645
to you and you never find out

760
00:26:59,645 --> 00:27:00,995
who it is those are the bad

761
00:27:00,995 --> 00:27:03,845
ones like something like yeah something like

762
00:27:03,845 --> 00:27:04,355
that happened too

763
00:27:04,385 --> 00:27:06,755
a friend of mine where someone was

764
00:27:06,755 --> 00:27:08,285
pranking their house a couple of times

765
00:27:08,285 --> 00:27:10,025
and i think they were so upset

766
00:27:10,055 --> 00:27:11,885
about the first example of it that

767
00:27:11,885 --> 00:27:13,985
the person felt like they could never

768
00:27:13,985 --> 00:27:16,505
say it was them yeah and and

769
00:27:16,505 --> 00:27:18,695
it's become a big mystery somebody to

770
00:27:18,695 --> 00:27:20,105
me one time they left a weird

771
00:27:20,105 --> 00:27:22,445
sign on my door that was vaguely

772
00:27:23,045 --> 00:27:24,515
vaguely threatening but it was

773
00:27:24,575 --> 00:27:26,435
clearly supposed to be a joke but

774
00:27:26,435 --> 00:27:28,295
it was still weird because i didn't

775
00:27:28,295 --> 00:27:29,525
know who did it right and it

776
00:27:29,525 --> 00:27:31,745
was very unnerving when i found out

777
00:27:31,745 --> 00:27:32,615
who did it was somebody that i

778
00:27:32,615 --> 00:27:33,755
didn't know that well and i was

779
00:27:33,755 --> 00:27:35,105
like that's not a cool thing to

780
00:27:35,105 --> 00:27:36,845

781
00:27:36,845 --> 00:27:39,485

through high school i went there every

816
00:28:49,535 --> 00:28:52,475

the whole summer no just for a

818
00:28:53,855 --> 00:28:54,785
week oh so

819
00:28:55,145 --> 00:28:56,615
and and my parents would go in

820
00:28:56,615 --> 00:28:58,382
the end they were separated from you

821
00:28:58,382 --> 00:29:01,085
the whole time you were separate in

822
00:29:01,085 --> 00:29:02,885
they got to like for a week

823
00:29:02,885 --> 00:29:04,985
being on this lake and hang out

00:29:04,985 --> 00:29:06,965
with adults and the kids were taking

825
00:29:06,965 --> 00:29:08,495
care of it separate yeah it was

826
00:29:08,495 --> 00:29:10,475
not bad so so i forgot we

827
00:29:10,475 --> 00:29:12,965
were where we were in um elementary

828
00:29:12,995 --> 00:29:14,135
it was just more like you know

829
00:29:14,135 --> 00:29:14,855
elementary school

830
00:29:15,335 --> 00:29:16,895
but then um then there was like

831
00:29:17,225 --> 00:29:19,295
indian village i think was when you

832
00:29:19,295 --> 00:29:21,605
were in junior high which was tps

833
00:29:21,605 --> 00:29:23,225
you would sleep in tps and stuff

834
00:29:23,615 --> 00:29:24,935
and then finally when you were in

835
00:29:24,935 --> 00:29:26,405
high school you want to make them

836
00:29:26,405 --> 00:29:28,235
or the widow they were already premade

837
00:29:28,235 --> 00:29:29,405
and stuff and then finally when you

838
00:29:29,405 --> 00:29:32,585
were in high school premade tv premise

839
00:29:32,615 --> 00:29:34,805
primitive from it's primitive

840
00:29:35,105 --> 00:29:37,925
quantity proposes setting the chai so finally

841
00:29:37,925 --> 00:29:38,705
when you were in high school you

842
00:29:38,705 --> 00:29:40,655
got to be in cabins with like

843
00:29:40,685 --> 00:29:42,305
you know seven of your other friends

844
00:29:42,755 --> 00:29:45,335
bunk beds and we had we we

845
00:29:45,335 --> 00:29:46,925
would have to go through inspection every

846
00:29:46,925 --> 00:29:48,125

847
00:29:48,125 --> 00:29:49,805

849
00:29:51,845 --> 00:29:54,035

850
00:29:54,035 --> 00:29:55,265
was in charge of us

851
00:29:55,295 --> 00:29:56,825

852
00:29:56,825 --> 00:29:58,835

00:35:44,776 --> 00:35:46,480
just an amazing artist we saw him

1025
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,710
the other day at this thing i

1026
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:50,289
was doing and yeah mike yeah and

1027
00:35:50,289 --> 00:35:51,370
it was like er no

1028
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:52,840
everyone was trying to figure out he

1029
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,760
never will everyone was trying to figure

1030
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:55,990
out if it was him everyone was

1031
00:35:55,990 --> 00:35:58,780
like his that stevie wonder or stevie

1032
00:35:58,780 --> 00:35:59,950
wonder looking guy

1033
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:03,550
and it finally came down to like

1034
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:06,220
i think he's not looking at anything

1035
00:36:06,550 --> 00:36:08,560
and so we were like ah and

1036
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,240
then he's holding the book upside down

1037
00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:11,680
right and then we heard what he

1038
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,207
was saying oh it is stevie wonder

1039
00:36:13,207 --> 00:36:14,260
but it was a good five minutes

1040
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:16,600
where people were crouched around well there's

1041
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,100
probably a reason why he wears sunglasses

1042
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:19,450
because his eyes look like they can

1043
00:36:19,450 --> 00:36:21,130
see is that what you're saying what

1044
00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:22,570
what what are you saying no i'm

1045
00:36:22,570 --> 00:36:24,520
just saying we were like oh he's

1046
00:36:24,610 --> 00:36:25,510
no we just how does a guy

1047
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:28,690
wearing sunglasses oh i thought you were

1048
00:36:28,690 --> 00:36:30,560
seeing his eyes and no no no

1049
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,630
no we'd like he thought he was

1050
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:33,250
something we thought oh this is maybe

1051
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:34,674
just a guy wearing sunglasses just like

1052
00:36:34,674 --> 00:36:36,520
a cool guy with long braids yeah

1053
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:38,200
well honestly exactly like stevie wonder

1054
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:42,790
but no eva anderson because she does

1055
00:36:42,790 --> 00:36:46,690

1056
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:49,000

00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,770

1059
00:36:51,730 --> 00:36:53,920
dad oh yeah yeah her dad terry

1060
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,600
anderson so once a year she would

1061
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,790
get the call to to do their

1062
00:36:57,790 --> 00:36:59,530
dual duo act oh

1063
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:01,360
and so and she would be i

1064
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:03,160
know she's you know she was at

1065
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:04,750
the magic house on the one one

1066
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:06,280

1071
00:37:13,390 --> 00:37:14,860
circle of the magic castle and all

1072
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:17,410
that she she knows that cocoa is

1073
00:37:17,410 --> 00:37:19,690
like it's literally just a trick

1074
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:23,230
the interpreter is is feeding all the

1075
00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:25,986
information with just like cocoa doing gibberish

1076
00:37:25,990 --> 00:37:27,490
and the interpreter is just saying like

1077
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,800
oh coco says this this this so

1078
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:32,290
what end but isn't it american sign

1079
00:37:32,290 --> 00:37:35,080
language no it's not something where like

1080
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:37,255
anyone can interpret what coco saying it's

1081
00:37:37,270 --> 00:37:39,820
the interpreter is interpreting oh so no

1082
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,710

00:44:48,140 --> 00:44:50,450
the game of murder now we just

1280

by asking questions and you can now

1291
00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:13,070
repeat a question that's been asked and

1292
00:45:13,070 --> 00:45:14,540
whoever guesses it right gets to start

1293
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:16,190

a tool would you consider technology to

1359
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:35,780

1360
00:48:35,930 --> 00:48:38,390
answer with seconds i know but i'm

1361
00:48:38,390 --> 00:48:40,549
trying to technology i was like electronics

1362
00:48:41,330 --> 00:48:42,410
so that's what i was just not

1363
00:48:42,410 --> 00:48:44,450
electronics go and tool it's not really

1364
00:48:44,450 --> 00:48:45,920
a tool it's an internet

1365
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:48,110
shit is it in this room

current post

1371
00:49:07,370 --> 00:49:08,300

00:49:14,150 --> 00:49:14,540
see it

1374
00:49:18,020 --> 00:49:19,910
damn it's a riddle

1375
00:49:23,810 --> 00:49:25,190

1376
00:49:28,430 --> 00:49:29,150

1377
00:49:29,930 --> 00:49:31,160
is it very old

1378
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:35,930
the invention of this thing it has

1379
00:49:35,990 --> 00:49:38,000
it's been around a long time i

1380
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,350
guess not doing yes or no is

1381
00:49:39,740 --> 00:49:41,000
different because i can lead you that

1382
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:41,960
was probably more useful

1383
00:49:43,335 --> 00:49:44,420
it's been around for

1384
00:49:45,950 --> 00:49:48,740
many many many many hundreds of years

1385
00:49:48,740 --> 00:49:52,070

1389
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:59,720
hundreds of years actually thousands if we're

1390
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:02,660
talking about zen's and thousand other cultures

1391
00:50:02,660 --> 00:50:05,660
and years is it oh other

1392
00:50:05,660 --> 00:50:07,040
