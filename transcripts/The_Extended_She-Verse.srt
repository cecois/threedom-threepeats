00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:00,480
did you know a scope you probably

136
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,100
know this maybe it was to lauren

137
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,660
back in the old tin pan alley

138
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:05,520
days i'm out somebody will

139
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:09,150
and for this reason i'm out they

140
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:11,700
would somebody write a song and then

141
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:14,190
every popular singer would do a cover

142
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:15,570
of it they'd do their own version

143
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:18,990
of it and then like one person's

144
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:21,750
cover would be the most popular one

145
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:23,970
but there would be multiple versions of

146
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:26,130
the same song out yeah so okay

147
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:26,880
i didn't really read

148
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,160
allies this but i've i've noticed that

149
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,720
when i'm searching for an oldie that

150
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,210
there are like many renditions but i

151
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:34,830
never really put it together thought about

152
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:35,700
it that was like a sort of

153
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,170
intentional thing to see which one would

154
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,330
pop it's just yeah i don't for

155
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:42,510
graphics i think it also went into

156
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:44,460
the sixties to where like bob dylan

157
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,260
a lot of his songs were written

158
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:47,040
for

159
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,860
for other people to sing them and

160
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:51,420
they became hits for other people even

161
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:53,190
though he's saying them himself on albums

162
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:54,390
you know like eight miles high and

163
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:57,930
all the cast yeah yeah but ah

164
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,810

every single

169
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:09,270

betters is the difference

173
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:23,640
say miles high intro was this about

174
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,450
a plane ride i did

175
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,930
the plainly went up eight miles

176
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:31,080
i just loved his stage or is

177
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,580
that it was always the same as

178
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:34,439
always one sentence wait oh wow he

179
00:06:34,439 --> 00:06:36,660

181
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,840
horse this song about a plane ride

182
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:40,200
i took

183
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,990
because like i don't need any context

184
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:47,460
know i don't want anyone else i

185
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:49,500

like longer and then it leads to

203
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:32,220
the big hit single things so like

204
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:34,080
in negotiate example it would be like

230
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:20,880

look very pale and wan

234
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,420
i mean the outdoor light i'm i'm

235
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:33,180
sitting right by the window yeah and

236
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:34,170
i feel like i'm getting a lot

237
00:08:34,170 --> 00:08:36,210
of nice natural light in here you

238
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:37,920
are but for some reason on my

239
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:40,260
computer screen it looks you know you

240
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:41,700
you have to wipe the jibs off

241
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,110
the skull oh here

242
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:45,690
for once

243
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:52,050
but okay here's my point please wow

244
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:55,770
what if gaultier he introduces the song

245
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,390
because he wants to keep the song

246
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:01,440
interesting yeah he he warns everyone hey

247
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:02,580
i'm gonna tell you the story behind

248
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,320
the song but i'm gonna actually keep

249
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,780
it kind of dull so that it

250
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:06,960
does

251
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:10,290
didn't render the song superfluous yeah right

252
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,000
so you will get some io things

253
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,220
and foe because all gonna be boring

254
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,900
shit like about the weather what i

255
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:18,000
what i haven't breakfast paul what would

256
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,340
you rather would you rather hear a

257
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:21,900
story or hear a song

258
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:24,780
well i mean it depends on the

259
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:27,000
storyteller it depends on the singer but

260
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:29,580
okay so the world's greatest storyteller

261
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,520
versus the world's greatest singer so j

262
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,300
k rowling

263
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,380
members so what's your alias what's your

264
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:41,490
aka oh robert goals bley to the

265
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:42,540
remembering i don't know

266
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:48,000
what does she write under that alias

267
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:49,890
weight she has like another alias yeah

268
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:51,150
j k rowling not her name i

269
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:54,480
would assume ah i don't know just

270
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,700
kidding rowling has hurt shame she wrote

271
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:58,980
she wrote a bunch of of mystery

272
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:01,170
novels or something under a a male

273
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:03,600
alias well that's probably where

274
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,660
yeah they're they're all about they have

275
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,490
trans stuff in them don't i will

276
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:10,800
say i with ray were the were

277
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,310
those books successful is the question i

278
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:15,900
think she put them out under the

279
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:17,940
alias because she just wanted to she

280
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:19,020
didn't want a bunch of j k

281
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:21,570
rowling fans to to buy it who

282
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,270
expecting you know wizard shit and stuff

like that

284
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:26,580
but then i think her alias got

285
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:28,470
revealed before it ever even came out

286
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:31,380
so it happened anyway or something well

00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,540

and so like they're down like a

313
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:33,510
wheelbarrow but they're on there holding onto

314
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:35,580

and then they have their hands on

318
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:43,500
their legs are being held up into

319
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:44,580
the air and

320
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:46,080
they're being pushed into the center of

321
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,090
the circle where there are balls and

322
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:49,410
they have to try to grab them

323
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:51,000
and bring them to their signs in

324
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,160
their mouths are just using their hands

325
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:56,520

make them marble eggs and then make

329
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:04,500

and gioco yeah

335
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,570

okay so they own like hand trucks

337
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:24,570

338
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:26,310
believe also mentioned in the stuff this

339
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:29,310
scooter i'm trying to describe we used

340
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:30,900
to use them in gym class in

341
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,520
elementary school and i don't know if

342
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,960
there's a thing that you used to

343
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,790
use like that where it's basically a

344
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:35,940
pl

345
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:37,890
plastic board with handles on the side

346
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:39,870
and four wheels on the bottom like

347
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:41,580
the bottom of a hamper or something

348
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:43,920
it's like and you're just you are

349
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,140
laying your chest onto the plastic and

350
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,820
holding onto the sides and then you're

351
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:49,939
being pushed into the center and then

352
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:51,180
like the thing i'm grabbing like a

353
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:54,480
mechanic users yeah but not exactly it

354
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,763
it's like a how can i

355
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:58,530
it's sad because is it escape board

356
00:12:58,530 --> 00:13:00,990
with a handle no it's a square

357
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:04,620
it's square so so equidistant on each

358
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:07,710
side exactly the same on all four

359
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:10,080
sides wow and anyone can measure it

360
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,670
and it's going to be proven true

361
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:15,660
and i've definitely told this story that

362
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:16,770
when i was in fifth grade we

363
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:18,930
used to play with those on like

364
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:21,270
friday and gym class yeah and i

365
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:23,070
was racing my friend around the gym

366
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:24,870
with basically running with my legs but

367
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:26,280
then using the scooter yeah it's like

368
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:29,130
you're sort of pike position and i

369
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:31,230
flew straight into the wall my glasses

370
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:33,060

409
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:04,440
it sounds like you

410
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:07,320
that's when i was attempting i would

411
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,540
just get put into weird random jobs

412
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:10,890
but to be a temp you have

413
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:13,350
to take like a typing test and

414
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:15,360
i remember i got

415
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:18,360
it was all computerized and i got

416
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:21,090
i got off at one point i

417
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:23,460
can't remember why you're supposed to like

418
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:25,050
type out a piece of paper that

419
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:26,160
they give you when they time you

420
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:27,960
and i got i got it off

421
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,790
and so like everything was gibberish when

422
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:32,730
i turned it in and and ah

423
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:34,320
the person taking the test because i

424
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,660
i got one thing

425
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:38,850
ing off and i'm done pretending to

426
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:41,820
type i got one thing off ok

427
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:43,710
you can't see what it's typing yes

428
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:44,880
you can't see what you're typing so

429
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,590
it messed up everything so the entire

430
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:49,200
thing was gibberish and i said oh

431
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,190
i mean i think i got one

432
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:51,570
thing wrong and it did all that

433
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:53,220
and she goes yeah you're probably fine

434
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:54,510
and she just gave me like shit

435
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:56,490
like because normally you can see it

436
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:56,790
yeah yeah

437
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:58,590
yeah i think is a key detail

438
00:15:58,710 --> 00:16:01,208
yeah exactly detail it's a kid to

439
00:16:01,208 --> 00:16:03,410
tell but also like what's the worst

440
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,710
it's going gonna happen is the company

441
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:06,990
that hires the temp for a day

442
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:08,760
or two is going to call them

443
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:09,870
and say you sent us a bad

444
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:11,100
temp but they'll be like oh no

445
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:13,560
we're so sorry sorry that eighteen year

446
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:16,230
old in the pool of other eighteen

447
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:16,830
year olds

448
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:18,926
it wasn't quite up to snuff yet

449
00:16:18,926 --> 00:16:20,547
let's see i always felt like and

450
00:16:20,547 --> 00:16:21,480
i had a lot of friends who

451
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,000
tempt um i always felt like that

452
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,380
was more stressful in a weird way

453
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:27,631
than i mean many jobs just me

454
00:16:27,631 --> 00:16:28,919
out but the idea of temping was

455
00:16:28,919 --> 00:16:30,690
stressful because it's like you go in

456
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:31,710
and you don't know anything and you

457
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:33,000
have to do things and act like

458
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,590
you know stuff that seems really hard

459
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:36,900
there's no pressure on you because no

460
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:37,110
one

461
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:39,000
cares what you do so they don't

462
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,160
give you any assignments no no you

463
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:42,300

464
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:45,030

471
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:57,270

563
00:20:30,545 --> 00:20:31,985
many of the work well i they

564
00:20:31,985 --> 00:20:33,485
dropped paint chips and then i ate

565
00:20:33,485 --> 00:20:36,305
them oh yeah because that they were

566
00:20:36,335 --> 00:20:40,025
chips yeah um but anyhoo i had

567
00:20:40,025 --> 00:20:42,515
learned on a blog of a interior

568
00:20:42,515 --> 00:20:44,375
designer that i like call ah called

569
00:20:44,405 --> 00:20:46,208
emily henderson i'm not british but that

570
00:20:46,385 --> 00:20:48,245
is her name she posted years ago

571
00:20:48,245 --> 00:20:49,535
on her blog about this idea i

572
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:50,780
don't know if she invented it but

573
00:20:50,866 --> 00:20:52,235
from the blog i remember thinking that

574
00:20:52,235 --> 00:20:53,765
she did to if you're gonna paint

575
00:20:53,765 --> 00:20:55,700
a room you get like posterboard and

576
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:56,345
new paint

577
00:20:56,825 --> 00:20:58,835
pieces of board the different colors and

578
00:20:58,835 --> 00:20:59,555
then you can hold them up in

579
00:20:59,555 --> 00:21:01,325
the different light you know sunlight over

580
00:21:01,325 --> 00:21:03,035
here a little dark you know what

581
00:21:03,035 --> 00:21:07,385
i mean so that yeah um and

582
00:21:07,595 --> 00:21:08,855
i thought oh such a great idea

583
00:21:08,885 --> 00:21:10,505
so then i was gonna do that

584
00:21:10,685 --> 00:21:11,525
when i'm going to paint a room

585
00:21:11,525 --> 00:21:13,595
in my house which i'm doing now

586
00:21:13,625 --> 00:21:15,545
and i went to this paint store

587
00:21:15,575 --> 00:21:16,625
and now they sell

588
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:19,625
all foam boards cut two little squares

589
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:20,675
and they have a little label on

590
00:21:20,675 --> 00:21:21,785
the back that says what kind of

591
00:21:21,785 --> 00:21:23,045
pain is this where did i put

592
00:21:23,045 --> 00:21:24,395
it what was the date and i

593
00:21:24,395 --> 00:21:25,295
thought that was really cute but i

594
00:21:25,295 --> 00:21:26,465
also wondered if they stole that from

595
00:21:26,465 --> 00:21:28,115
her and then i also just wanted

596
00:21:28,115 --> 00:21:29,497
to say it's great because if you

597
00:21:29,525 --> 00:21:30,725
are someone who's interested in this kind

598
00:21:30,725 --> 00:21:32,285
of stuff you can save all the

599
00:21:32,285 --> 00:21:34,565
colors that you've painted and then later

600
00:21:34,565 --> 00:21:35,495
you might want to do a different

601
00:21:35,495 --> 00:21:36,725
room and go oh this would actually

602
00:21:36,725 --> 00:21:36,785

684
00:24:42,005 --> 00:24:44,585
a disgusting combo it was it was

685
00:24:44,647 --> 00:24:46,805
and then some brown as well it's

686
00:24:46,805 --> 00:24:50,165
terrible and so and so now now

687
00:24:50,165 --> 00:24:52,055
i am also replaced as a prank

688
00:24:52,055 --> 00:24:54,845
show it kind of is because like

689
00:24:54,845 --> 00:24:57,037
truly people would be so upset when

690
00:24:57,037 --> 00:24:58,385
they go back in their house because

691
00:24:58,385 --> 00:25:00,305
it's boring it was so cheap

692
00:25:00,545 --> 00:25:01,745
first picture with a prank the home

693
00:25:01,745 --> 00:25:03,815
viewer yeah yeah and the whole fucking

694
00:25:03,815 --> 00:25:05,705
with us they were pranking homes

695
00:25:06,815 --> 00:25:08,285
this guy there was one designer who

696
00:25:08,285 --> 00:25:10,655
would always put like little like humpty

697
00:25:10,655 --> 00:25:12,125
dumpty around the room it was just

698
00:25:12,125 --> 00:25:15,095
really weird early yeah very farm themed

699
00:25:15,395 --> 00:25:16,745
that's yours and to be fair i

700
00:25:16,745 --> 00:25:18,035
mean i don't know that was how

701
00:25:18,605 --> 00:25:19,985
he was he was an actual egg

702
00:25:20,015 --> 00:25:21,215
he was a negative is kind of

703
00:25:21,215 --> 00:25:23,885
his yeah gosh i guess no one

704
00:25:23,914 --> 00:25:25,895
mentioned it ever you know because aig

705
00:25:25,895 --> 00:25:26,945
man who wore pants

706
00:25:26,945 --> 00:25:28,925
it's yeah well he's very fragile

707
00:25:30,185 --> 00:25:31,925
but so so finally when i moved

708
00:25:31,925 --> 00:25:34,745
to a different place we just keep

709
00:25:34,745 --> 00:25:38,465
everything white basically or off-white yeah yeah

710
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:39,725
it's just so much better and so

711
00:25:39,725 --> 00:25:41,975
much calmer and yeah yeah way better

712
00:25:42,905 --> 00:25:45,185
million colors yeah you like well i

713
00:25:45,185 --> 00:25:46,625
mean you have so it depends on

714
00:25:46,625 --> 00:25:48,005
the space too you have the where

715
00:25:48,005 --> 00:25:50,195
you are right now yeah oh my

716
00:25:50,345 --> 00:25:51,635
my i'll just say your address if

717
00:25:51,635 --> 00:25:52,085
that's ok

718
00:25:54,155 --> 00:25:55,835
but um your podcast space has great

719
00:25:55,835 --> 00:25:57,065
wallpaper and i think of it's like

720
00:25:57,065 --> 00:25:59,285
a smaller room that's used for a

721
00:25:59,285 --> 00:26:01,715
special purpose or like ah ah ah

722
00:26:01,745 --> 00:26:03,425
powder or something like that you yeah

723
00:26:03,455 --> 00:26:05,435
great wallpaper you know yeah yeah i've

724
00:26:05,435 --> 00:26:08,165
done i've done some wallpaper yeah right

725
00:26:08,285 --> 00:26:11,225
if you're director of powder powder for

726
00:26:11,255 --> 00:26:12,215
your daniel powder

727
00:26:13,295 --> 00:26:14,165
yeah she's down

728
00:26:15,425 --> 00:26:17,555
soothing powder ever since you had a

729
00:26:17,555 --> 00:26:18,095
bad day

730
00:26:19,685 --> 00:26:21,095
maybe he's like getting hit by lightning

731
00:26:21,095 --> 00:26:23,525
he's like the character head of bed

732
00:26:23,795 --> 00:26:25,505
i had a bad day do you

733
00:26:25,505 --> 00:26:27,545
think because you almost fired my powder

734
00:26:27,905 --> 00:26:30,575
probably because the singer's name is that

735
00:26:30,575 --> 00:26:32,285
so yeah that makes sense the song

736
00:26:32,285 --> 00:26:33,935
would be inspired by what they're doing

737
00:26:34,205 --> 00:26:37,145
something similar very everybody was calling him

738
00:26:37,145 --> 00:26:38,705
powder and it made him have a

739
00:26:38,705 --> 00:26:39,425
bad day

740

there there was a period of time

794
00:28:31,145 --> 00:28:32,075
where it's trendy to have like a

795
00:28:32,075 --> 00:28:34,145
little three d image on your t-shirt

796
00:28:34,175 --> 00:28:34,925

just be the cover but sometimes it

823
00:29:29,255 --> 00:29:30,815
would be the whole book where it

824
00:29:30,815 --> 00:29:33,125
would be all those sort of lenticular

825
00:29:33,125 --> 00:29:35,165

916
00:32:20,535 --> 00:32:23,055

917
00:32:23,055 --> 00:32:25,815
about pirates like kids don't need to

918
00:32:25,845 --> 00:32:27,285
have pirates explained to them they just

919
00:32:27,285 --> 00:32:28,905
seem to be on board right away

920
00:32:28,995 --> 00:32:30,525
you know what i mean but everybody's

921
00:32:30,525 --> 00:32:31,965
so worried about if two men are

922
00:32:31,965 --> 00:32:34,845
kissing yeah explain it to your bait

923
00:32:35,025 --> 00:32:38,355
yeah your guy oh i know i

924
00:32:38,355 --> 00:32:38,505
know

925
00:32:38,766 --> 00:32:40,725
so many things like that yeah all

926
00:32:40,725 --> 00:32:43,305
the concepts that kids grasp without they

927
00:32:43,305 --> 00:32:45,495
don't give surely they don't care but

928
00:32:45,495 --> 00:32:47,865
here's my question because i was reading

929
00:32:47,865 --> 00:32:50,445
some some books about animals and the

930
00:32:50,445 --> 00:32:51,555
only animal the ones

931
00:32:53,175 --> 00:32:54,165
wow what do we got we got

932
00:32:54,285 --> 00:32:57,195
a horse he's ah that's your question

933
00:32:57,765 --> 00:33:00,615
what are they oh no no the

934
00:33:00,615 --> 00:33:02,505
only animals she's seen are two dogs

935
00:33:02,625 --> 00:33:05,055
to spread our scientific in-person right yes

936
00:33:05,085 --> 00:33:08,205
in person so when i'm reading these

937
00:33:08,205 --> 00:33:10,395
books i'm like oh the the cat

938
00:33:10,395 --> 00:33:12,735
goes meow right sure like she is

939
00:33:12,795 --> 00:33:15,195
no what a fucking cat is i

940
00:33:15,195 --> 00:33:16,335
know but she's gonna start to learn

941
00:33:16,335 --> 00:33:17,535
all that it's actually kind of weird

942
00:33:17,535 --> 00:33:19,215
i thought the same thing i also

943
00:33:19,215 --> 00:33:20,415
feel like that's what the pictures for

944
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:22,005
a while but that's what i find

945
00:33:22,005 --> 00:33:23,625
really fascinating is that

946
00:33:24,885 --> 00:33:26,145
and i think i mentioned this but

947
00:33:26,145 --> 00:33:28,665
like holly i was very shocked when

948
00:33:28,665 --> 00:33:30,735
like she was noticing all types of

949
00:33:30,735 --> 00:33:33,855
dogs as being dogs and all cartoons

950
00:33:33,855 --> 00:33:35,355
of dogs as being dogs and like

951
00:33:35,595 --> 00:33:37,815
she knows she knows i mean dorm

952
00:33:37,815 --> 00:33:39,975
of like this type of nose and

953
00:33:40,605 --> 00:33:42,675
and four legs if they're tiny if

954
00:33:42,675 --> 00:33:44,085
they're huge like she knows what they

955
00:33:44,085 --> 00:33:44,925
are when we're out it's just that

956
00:33:44,925 --> 00:33:46,905
it's that's amazing to me but katherine

957
00:33:46,905 --> 00:33:48,735
jones never wanted to anything else instead

958
00:33:48,735 --> 00:33:51,225
it was adult not once

959
00:33:52,395 --> 00:33:54,675
not a chair now that's more like

960
00:33:54,675 --> 00:33:56,115
wow not once

961
00:33:57,165 --> 00:33:59,445
she's never once she's never once called

962
00:33:59,445 --> 00:34:02,295
something other than it's name she's never

963
00:34:02,295 --> 00:34:04,245
once done that she always calls things

964
00:34:04,245 --> 00:34:06,285
exactly what exactly what it is yeah

965
00:34:07,695 --> 00:34:08,955
like a cat and a dog are

966
00:34:08,955 --> 00:34:10,995
so similar like really what are the

967
00:34:10,995 --> 00:34:13,365
differences when you really break it down

968
00:34:13,425 --> 00:34:14,745
um names

969
00:34:15,915 --> 00:34:16,245
yeah

970
00:34:17,595 --> 00:34:19,485
like your da they're the exact same

971
00:34:19,485 --> 00:34:23,745
thing no this bold i don't think

972
00:34:23,745 --> 00:34:25,815
they're really exact like if you looked

973
00:34:25,845 --> 00:34:27,375
if if you saw a cat and

974
00:34:27,375 --> 00:34:29,295
a dog could you tell which was

975
00:34:29,295 --> 00:34:29,715
which

976
00:34:31,935 --> 00:34:35,205
i wouldn't want to because i wouldn't

977
00:34:35,205 --> 00:34:36,285
want to be rude but wait

978
00:34:38,685 --> 00:34:42,225
timeless what what japanese on with wild

979
00:34:42,225 --> 00:34:44,145
horses she was like talking about when

980
00:34:44,145 --> 00:34:45,285
she was reading these books with her

981
00:34:45,285 --> 00:34:47,415
kids when they were really little she

982
00:34:47,415 --> 00:34:48,945
liked didn't know the difference between a

983
00:34:48,948 --> 00:34:50,085
goat and sheep

984
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:53,020
and it made me laugh so much

985
00:34:53,025 --> 00:34:53,955
that you took them like a petting

986
00:34:53,955 --> 00:34:54,975
zoo and she was like i don't

987
00:34:54,975 --> 00:34:57,525
know what each one is but now

988
00:34:57,525 --> 00:34:59,235
they're supposed to know what every thing

989
00:34:59,235 --> 00:35:00,645
is it's just like some are very

990
00:35:00,645 --> 00:35:02,265
hard like a mongoose or something i

991
00:35:02,265 --> 00:35:03,825
don't know that if i saw something

992
00:35:04,635 --> 00:35:05,865
if i saw a mongoose would i

993
00:35:05,865 --> 00:35:07,185
be able to say that's a mongoose

994
00:35:07,275 --> 00:35:09,315
rikki tikki my dear boy

995
00:35:10,425 --> 00:35:11,535
i'm sure i would say it's a

996
00:35:11,535 --> 00:35:13,065
rikki tikki tavi but what i say

997
00:35:13,065 --> 00:35:14,505
it's a mongoose i don't yeah you

998
00:35:14,505 --> 00:35:17,865
would yeah you would well yeah you

999
00:35:17,925 --> 00:35:19,185
know fun is going to the zoo

1000
00:35:19,185 --> 00:35:20,685
with all the animals can be really

1001
00:35:20,685 --> 00:35:22,845
weird like when watching holly look at

1002
00:35:22,845 --> 00:35:24,225
ah i don't i never know how

1003
00:35:24,225 --> 00:35:25,545
to say it but like a taper

1004
00:35:25,605 --> 00:35:28,875
tpr tpr yeah i'm like that's a

1005
00:35:28,875 --> 00:35:30,375
really weird animal and she was kinda

1006
00:35:30,375 --> 00:35:30,525
where

1007
00:35:30,525 --> 00:35:32,175
faded out she was like huh ooh

1008
00:35:32,265 --> 00:35:34,935
like ooh it's like so strange and

1009
00:35:34,935 --> 00:35:35,985
like i don't really know what it

1010
00:35:35,985 --> 00:35:38,985
is well we have these cards they're

1011
00:35:38,985 --> 00:35:42,135
like flashcards with animals that emerald likes

1012
00:35:42,135 --> 00:35:43,275
to look at because they're black and

1013
00:35:43,275 --> 00:35:46,395
white and very striking and there's you

1014
00:35:46,395 --> 00:35:48,435
know there's good ones or skunk there's

1015
00:35:48,435 --> 00:35:50,475
penguin she really likes penguin perfect for

1016
00:35:50,475 --> 00:35:50,685
black

1017
00:35:50,715 --> 00:35:52,605
and light too yeah yeah but then

1018
00:35:52,605 --> 00:35:55,575
some and and it's like penguin ah

1019
00:35:55,575 --> 00:35:57,345
skunk orca stuff like that and then

1020
00:35:57,345 --> 00:36:01,935
suddenly there's ring-tailed lemur they make some

1021
00:36:01,935 --> 00:36:03,885
fucking leaps with this stuff i feel

1022
00:36:03,885 --> 00:36:05,073
the same way or i'm going yeah

1023
00:36:05,085 --> 00:36:07,725
luke really i'm just like why are

1024
00:36:07,725 --> 00:36:09,465
we jumping now she has to know

1025
00:36:09,465 --> 00:36:10,845
what a ring halo lee

1026
00:36:10,845 --> 00:36:13,455
rumor is yeah why don't we just

1027
00:36:13,455 --> 00:36:15,915
say lima why don't we just go

1028
00:36:15,945 --> 00:36:17,475
like let's just kind of narrow it

1029
00:36:17,505 --> 00:36:19,035
like let's just broaden it a little

1030
00:36:19,035 --> 00:36:21,615
bit because sometimes it gets very monkey

1031
00:36:21,615 --> 00:36:23,805
or something you'd like him even monkey

1032
00:36:23,955 --> 00:36:25,571
gorilla i start to go now i've

1033
00:36:25,571 --> 00:36:27,315
got all these types of monkey rang

1034
00:36:27,315 --> 00:36:29,685
a tapes and here's a trick here's

1035
00:36:29,685 --> 00:36:30,255
my theory

1036
00:36:31,065 --> 00:36:32,835
okay so i learned all the animals

1037
00:36:32,925 --> 00:36:36,225
from my a to z book or

1038
00:36:36,465 --> 00:36:38,595
eight hundred for yuki listener thanks and

1039
00:36:38,595 --> 00:36:40,725
this was like last year you focused

1040
00:36:40,725 --> 00:36:41,565
on that and you really it was

1041
00:36:41,655 --> 00:36:43,335
it was during the pandemic yeah yeah

1042
00:36:43,935 --> 00:36:45,525
but um where it's like you know

1043
00:36:45,555 --> 00:36:46,905
a is for aardvark and all that

1044
00:36:46,905 --> 00:36:48,855
kind of true there should there should

1045
00:36:48,855 --> 00:36:50,445
only be twenty four animals and they

1046
00:36:50,445 --> 00:36:51,165
should all be a differ

1047
00:36:51,165 --> 00:36:52,995
that letter so you can just memorize

1048
00:36:52,995 --> 00:36:54,195
that do you know there are twenty

1049
00:36:54,195 --> 00:36:56,325
six letters in the alphabet but

1050
00:36:57,675 --> 00:37:00,585
wait wasn't the show twenty four about

1051
00:37:00,585 --> 00:37:01,395
the alphabet

1052
00:37:06,165 --> 00:37:07,965
were you accounting for x and z

1053
00:37:07,965 --> 00:37:09,375
and saying cut those out we don't

1054
00:37:09,375 --> 00:37:10,785
need yeah we don't don't we don't

1055
00:37:10,785 --> 00:37:13,485
need zebras and animals zebras zebras key

1056
00:37:13,485 --> 00:37:15,555
you're right no waste to the waste

1057
00:37:15,585 --> 00:37:16,605
yeah but we need to get rid

1058
00:37:16,605 --> 00:37:19,095
of x x is a really tricky

1059
00:37:19,095 --> 00:37:22,095
word with learning letter with learning words

1060
00:37:22,125 --> 00:37:22,575
like just

1061
00:37:22,635 --> 00:37:23,775
like why do we need x we

1062
00:37:23,775 --> 00:37:25,245
have a c k we need we

1063
00:37:25,245 --> 00:37:27,465
should make up a bunch of louis

1064
00:37:27,465 --> 00:37:27,855
c k

1065
00:37:29,145 --> 00:37:30,495
we should make up a muslim saint

1066
00:37:30,495 --> 00:37:33,555
louis x that started with x and

1067
00:37:33,555 --> 00:37:35,145
then just kinda like get those into

1068
00:37:35,145 --> 00:37:36,525
the culture so that we can just

1069
00:37:36,525 --> 00:37:38,415
start having fun things on the page

1070
00:37:38,415 --> 00:37:40,455
like a xylophone is not well yeah

1071
00:37:40,485 --> 00:37:42,195
wow we have we have xylophone we

1072
00:37:42,195 --> 00:37:44,775
have xenophobes thank you for that x-ray

1073
00:37:44,775 --> 00:37:47,265
and we have x pacers yeah it's

1074
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:49,035
not enough it's not enough

1075
00:37:49,275 --> 00:37:50,775
we need more than you and that's

1076
00:37:50,775 --> 00:37:52,305
why we're saying we want to do

1077
00:37:52,305 --> 00:37:54,165
things losers out there to create new

1078
00:37:54,165 --> 00:37:56,415
words but it should be like she'd

1079
00:37:56,415 --> 00:37:59,235
be like xenophobe as like that's what

1080
00:37:59,265 --> 00:38:01,305
x stands for zena folks with zeal

1081
00:38:01,395 --> 00:38:02,595
yeah because this is kind of stuff

1082
00:38:02,595 --> 00:38:04,815
we want the decoding kit they don't

1083
00:38:04,815 --> 00:38:07,365
everyone should be a phobia yeah yeah

1084
00:38:07,425 --> 00:38:08,265
yeah awful

1085
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:10,785
oh boy okay so some on the

1086
00:38:10,785 --> 00:38:11,655
animals

1087
00:38:12,885 --> 00:38:16,065
what who who are the picks for

1088
00:38:16,305 --> 00:38:18,135
each letter like a you've got gotta

1089
00:38:18,135 --> 00:38:19,633
go aardvark because of the double a

1090
00:38:19,665 --> 00:38:21,105
because the double a it's so good

1091
00:38:21,165 --> 00:38:23,025
and by the way who's who's calling

1092
00:38:23,025 --> 00:38:25,395
an aardvark aardvark saying like oh i'm

1093
00:38:25,395 --> 00:38:26,475
gonna put a double a at the

1094
00:38:26,475 --> 00:38:28,785
beginning of this like what what lunatic

1095
00:38:28,935 --> 00:38:30,585
ne yeah they were just having fun

1096
00:38:30,675 --> 00:38:32,715
i think i'm gonna say yeah it's

1097
00:38:32,715 --> 00:38:32,921
true

1098
00:38:32,925 --> 00:38:34,605
what about anteater i think anteaters are

1099
00:38:34,605 --> 00:38:37,065
more financial than an aardvark fun in

1100
00:38:37,065 --> 00:38:39,255
the sense of like genocide for ants

1101
00:38:39,945 --> 00:38:41,835
because of the widget it looks like

1102
00:38:41,835 --> 00:38:42,795
a vacuum

1103
00:38:44,355 --> 00:38:45,975
it doesn't look like exactly it's probably

1104
00:38:45,975 --> 00:38:47,625
the animal that looks most like a

1105
00:38:47,625 --> 00:38:51,285
vacuum out of any i don't know

1106
00:38:51,315 --> 00:38:53,295
elephant though even that looks like longest

1107
00:38:53,295 --> 00:38:55,215
time i thought aardvark and anteater were

1108
00:38:55,215 --> 00:38:57,345
the same thing and i think there's

1109
00:38:57,345 --> 00:38:59,295
a lot of confusion around right that

1110
00:38:59,295 --> 00:39:00,525
there's it only be one and we

1111
00:39:00,525 --> 00:39:03,915
eliminate whatever we make them extinct whenever

1112
00:39:03,915 --> 00:39:04,125
the other

1113
00:39:04,125 --> 00:39:05,199
the one is do you know why

1114
00:39:05,199 --> 00:39:06,765
i thought that because of the cartoon

1115
00:39:06,765 --> 00:39:08,175
the aardvark and i was just going

1116
00:39:08,235 --> 00:39:09,825
oh i think you'd say about arthur

1117
00:39:09,825 --> 00:39:11,835
the aardvark not on game

1118
00:39:12,795 --> 00:39:14,355
alright well he's a great guy is

1119
00:39:14,355 --> 00:39:15,705
he the guy from the famous hand

1120
00:39:16,485 --> 00:39:19,185
yeah the in the fist oh yes

1121
00:39:19,185 --> 00:39:22,275
exactly now okay have you seen the

1122
00:39:22,335 --> 00:39:25,695
pride and prejudice with um tom lambs

1123
00:39:25,695 --> 00:39:28,185
gans from succession oh my god or

1124
00:39:28,185 --> 00:39:29,775
nightly i saw that a million years

1125
00:39:29,775 --> 00:39:31,155
ago but when i put together that

1126
00:39:31,155 --> 00:39:32,145
it was him in that i wanted

1127
00:39:32,145 --> 00:39:32,655
to watch

1128
00:39:32,685 --> 00:39:35,055
that again because i love him i

1129
00:39:35,055 --> 00:39:36,495
saw for the first time a couple

1130
00:39:36,495 --> 00:39:37,365
of years ago and it was really

1131
00:39:37,365 --> 00:39:39,585
enjoyable um so i recommend every watch

1132
00:39:39,855 --> 00:39:41,655
but i know that there's a thing

1133
00:39:41,655 --> 00:39:43,095
that he does with his hand that

1134
00:39:43,095 --> 00:39:45,825
i remembered that that a lot of

1135
00:39:45,885 --> 00:39:47,415
people that are fans of that movie

1136
00:39:47,445 --> 00:39:48,525
remember that and they think it's very

1137
00:39:48,525 --> 00:39:50,415
romantic and i forgot to look for

1138
00:39:50,415 --> 00:39:51,615
it when i watched the movie and

1139
00:39:51,615 --> 00:39:52,695
i still don't know who

1140
00:39:52,845 --> 00:39:54,315
was but it was apparently a very

1141
00:39:54,315 --> 00:39:57,075
notable thing that he does oh i

1142
00:39:57,075 --> 00:39:58,605
don't remember but i always picture the

1143
00:39:58,635 --> 00:40:00,795
arthur hand when i hear he does

1144
00:40:00,795 --> 00:40:02,175
it with her hand or he does

1145
00:40:02,175 --> 00:40:03,405
it with his own hand he does

1146
00:40:03,405 --> 00:40:05,055
something with his own hand that is

1147
00:40:05,085 --> 00:40:08,925
apparently very magical magical it's not him

1148
00:40:08,925 --> 00:40:11,715
delta man her something romantic finger banging

1149
00:40:12,015 --> 00:40:12,795

but you had lunch davao boxcar

1224
00:43:11,325 --> 00:43:13,485
ah i remember reading a book about

1225
00:43:13,785 --> 00:43:15,945
so this is in my early twenties

1226
00:43:15,975 --> 00:43:17,325
i don't i don't know the title

1227
00:43:17,955 --> 00:43:19,737
but i remember it was about relationships

1228
00:43:19,737 --> 00:43:20,385
and it was about

1229
00:43:22,425 --> 00:43:25,635
i remember it being about how like

1230
00:43:26,565 --> 00:43:30,015
there are different types of people in

1231
00:43:30,015 --> 00:43:32,955
the world shit what was it about

1232
00:43:32,955 --> 00:43:34,724
i just remember the gist so it

1233
00:43:34,724 --> 00:43:37,545
changed your life the database just if

1234
00:43:37,545 --> 00:43:39,675
it is like a successful relationship is

1235
00:43:39,675 --> 00:43:41,745
usually with two people who

1236
00:43:41,745 --> 00:43:42,885
i have a lot of stuff going

1237
00:43:42,885 --> 00:43:45,435
on interesting in their own lives and

1238
00:43:45,435 --> 00:43:47,055
then they meet up at the end

1239
00:43:47,055 --> 00:43:47,985
of the day and they check in

1240
00:43:47,985 --> 00:43:49,365
with each other about their own lives

1241
00:43:49,365 --> 00:43:50,595
and they hear about each other's own

1242
00:43:50,595 --> 00:43:54,405
lives and an alessi not being codependent

1243
00:43:54,765 --> 00:43:56,264
yes i think it was about codependency

1244
00:43:56,265 --> 00:43:58,575
it was a less successful relationship is

1245
00:43:58,575 --> 00:44:00,315
to people who are constantly wondering what

1246
00:44:00,315 --> 00:44:01,485
the other person is doing

1247
00:44:02,085 --> 00:44:04,005
and or like sitting around the house

1248
00:44:04,005 --> 00:44:06,465
letting the other person shine and while

1249
00:44:06,465 --> 00:44:08,115
they don't do anything or whatever and

1250
00:44:08,115 --> 00:44:10,845
so i remember that being kind of

1251
00:44:10,845 --> 00:44:12,675
like yes that's the type of relationship

1252
00:44:12,675 --> 00:44:14,805
i want is with someone who has

1253
00:44:14,805 --> 00:44:17,625
their own thing going on and is

1254
00:44:17,985 --> 00:44:19,395
not just sitting around waiting for me

1255
00:44:19,395 --> 00:44:21,105
to do stuff you know so yeah

1256
00:44:22,185 --> 00:44:24,285
i'm trying to think if i you

1257
00:44:24,285 --> 00:44:25,725
know i think i had different moments

1258
00:44:25,725 --> 00:44:27,285
with books where it was like like

1259
00:44:27,285 --> 00:44:29,055
read like eckhart totally or whatever then

1260
00:44:29,055 --> 00:44:31,005
i was like yes and then i

1261
00:44:31,305 --> 00:44:33,855
stopped you know thinking about any of

1262
00:44:33,855 --> 00:44:35,205
that so i don't know that there

1263
00:44:35,205 --> 00:44:37,035
was like a book that really stuck

1264
00:44:37,035 --> 00:44:39,015
with me forever that changed something for

1265
00:44:39,015 --> 00:44:40,665
me in that way other than just

1266
00:44:40,665 --> 00:44:42,225
being books i enjoyed reading

1267
00:44:42,735 --> 00:44:44,805
um but maybe one day i'll have

1268
00:44:44,805 --> 00:44:46,875
that book dealing with the public i

1269
00:44:46,875 --> 00:44:47,985
could think of that kind of had

1270
00:44:47,985 --> 00:44:49,815
a big impact on my life was

1271
00:44:49,815 --> 00:44:50,175
ah

1272
00:44:51,165 --> 00:44:52,275

1474
00:51:58,360 --> 00:51:59,920

1476
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:05,620
um okay okay i do i do

1477
00:52:05,620 --> 00:52:07,570
have a story alright i was working

1478
00:52:07,570 --> 00:52:08,290
in a restaurant

1479
00:52:09,820 --> 00:52:12,130
and a manager came in wearing all

1480
00:52:12,130 --> 00:52:14,590
yellow and she was she'd been crying

1481
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:27,100
the year was nineteen eighty one

1482
00:52:29,350 --> 00:52:32,470
me and my friend new year's eve

1483
00:52:33,490 --> 00:52:36,730
were playing a video game and our

1484
00:52:36,730 --> 00:52:39,820
goal is to turn the game over

1485
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:42,942
which is to reset the score yeah

1486
00:52:42,942 --> 00:52:44,830
you get a score so high that

1487
00:52:44,830 --> 00:52:46,510
eventually goes back to zero

1488
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:51,040
our aim is to do this before

1489
00:52:51,130 --> 00:52:53,080
the clock strikes twelve

1490
00:52:54,100 --> 00:52:54,790
at midnight

1491
00:52:56,470 --> 00:52:58,030
we are listening to a top forty

1492
00:52:58,030 --> 00:52:58,810
radio station

1493
00:53:00,070 --> 00:53:03,220
we are playing the game we're making

1494
00:53:03,220 --> 00:53:05,470
it happen we're trading off asking the

1495
00:53:05,470 --> 00:53:06,520
controller to each other

1496
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:09,250

1497
00:53:10,900 --> 00:53:15,970
exactly at eleven bongs of the clock

1498
00:53:17,380 --> 00:53:20,470
we turned the game over we celebrated

1499
00:53:22,540 --> 00:53:23,380

00:56:29,620 --> 00:56:30,850
it was a man or a woman

1577
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:33,910

like you know so and i was

1579
00:56:36,010 --> 00:56:37,510
pretty close to it and i looked

1580
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:39,550
back and there wasn't a lifeguard so

1581
00:56:39,550 --> 00:56:41,380
i went out out there and it

1582
00:56:41,380 --> 00:56:42,970
was pretty shallow so it was like

1583
00:56:43,570 --> 00:56:45,250
there was really nothing going on but

1584
00:56:45,250 --> 00:56:46,390
it was this girl who had gotten

1585
00:56:46,390 --> 00:56:46,960
a cramp

1586
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:51,370

1610
00:57:55,870 --> 00:57:58,059
scary house in the neighborhood that we

1611
00:57:58,090 --> 00:57:59,680
always dared each other like go up

1612
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:02,494
and touch the door whatever and halloween

1613
00:58:02,505 --> 00:58:06,490

1614
00:58:06,550 --> 00:58:09,520
um and i remember my friend went

1615
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:10,180

you went on a killing spree

1619
00:58:21,130 --> 00:58:23,080

that we kind of walk along the

1637
00:59:03,820 --> 00:59:04,660

across america we sort of did because

1662
01:00:01,780 --> 01:00:03,550

was i don't really remember anything else

1666
01:00:11,410 --> 01:00:13,960
happening i remember when we were kids

1667
01:00:14,050 --> 01:00:15,970
in maine and um

1668
01:00:17,410 --> 01:00:18,940
ah we were little kids we were

1669
01:00:18,940 --> 01:00:21,520
like a tight knit group of ah

1670
01:00:21,580 --> 01:00:25,990
outcasts freaks and nerds and um well

1671
01:00:26,350 --> 01:00:27,430
we found that there was a clown

1672
01:00:27,430 --> 01:00:28,330
that lived in the sewer

1673
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:31,450
and isn't that what talked to about

1674
01:00:31,450 --> 01:00:34,330
weird that always happens it was so

1675
01:00:34,780 --> 01:00:36,430
this is like the thing i ah

1676
01:00:36,460 --> 01:00:38,800
kids today don't understand but if you're

1677
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:40,480
an eighties kid you get it yeah

1678
01:00:40,630 --> 01:00:43,660
um sounds were clowns like they lived

1679
01:00:44,110 --> 01:00:46,810
exclusively in sewers back then they weren't

1680
01:00:46,810 --> 01:00:48,460
all bad either some were found out

1681
01:00:48,490 --> 01:00:49,480
they were great in fact if you

1682
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:49,540
eh

1683
01:00:50,365 --> 01:00:52,375
like you if you were the proprietor

1684
01:00:52,375 --> 01:00:54,535
of a circus and you need to

1685
01:00:54,535 --> 01:00:56,095
hire clowns you would just go to

1686
01:00:56,095 --> 01:00:58,165
the sewers yell hey throw a man

1687
01:00:58,195 --> 01:01:00,354
oh yeah and they wanted jobs so

1688
01:01:00,354 --> 01:01:01,315
they were kind of always tend to

1689
01:01:01,345 --> 01:01:03,805
weightings yeah because their dream was to

1690
01:01:03,805 --> 01:01:07,045
live in an apartment so yeah um

1691
01:01:07,075 --> 01:01:08,875
so there's other all high rises because

1692
01:01:08,875 --> 01:01:10,285
they made so much money exam

1693
01:01:10,285 --> 01:01:12,475
exactly don't even get me started on

1694
01:01:12,475 --> 01:01:16,255
the clown uprising so i remember this

1695
01:01:16,255 --> 01:01:19,975
rising homage like real bad um and

1696
01:01:19,975 --> 01:01:22,075
then we felt stupid because even though

1697
01:01:22,225 --> 01:01:23,815
one of us did get killed he

1698
01:01:23,815 --> 01:01:25,285
turned out to be just a big

1699
01:01:25,285 --> 01:01:28,015
spider from outer space matter okay that's

1700
01:01:28,015 --> 01:01:29,725
crazy that you didn't realize that

1701
01:01:30,475 --> 01:01:31,945
he looks i'm telling you if you

1702
01:01:31,945 --> 01:01:33,415
saw him he looked like a clown

1703
01:01:34,105 --> 01:01:38,635
okay do a picture yeah writer okay

1704
01:01:38,635 --> 01:01:39,775
yeah that looks like a cloud that

1705
01:01:39,775 --> 01:01:41,815
looks exactly like no way oh wait

1706
01:01:42,565 --> 01:01:44,215
you turned to this it's lenticular

1707
01:01:45,565 --> 01:01:48,535
outer space k you didn't return yeah

1708
01:01:48,595 --> 01:01:50,695
we never looked at him sideways oh

1709
01:01:50,875 --> 01:01:52,165
we always looked at him straight on

1710
01:01:52,825 --> 01:01:54,415
i have one deep in the eyes

1711
01:01:54,715 --> 01:01:55,405
oh okay good

1712
01:01:56,965 --> 01:02:01,105
so back in like this was the

1713
01:02:01,105 --> 01:02:04,225
ninety s i was like

1714
01:02:05,545 --> 01:02:06,805
i guess you would say i was

1715
01:02:06,805 --> 01:02:12,805
like a paleontologist and i loved dinosaurs

1716
01:02:13,015 --> 01:02:15,835
sure and i die no dna right

1717
01:02:15,865 --> 01:02:18,925
i got involved in this like wasn't

1718
01:02:18,925 --> 01:02:20,725
like a museum it was like it

1719
01:02:20,725 --> 01:02:22,825
wasn't an amusement park wasn't a zoo

1720
01:02:22,855 --> 01:02:24,145
it was kind of like all of

1721
01:02:24,145 --> 01:02:25,405
the above combine

1722
01:02:26,845 --> 01:02:28,165
which i thought was a great idea

1723
01:02:28,195 --> 01:02:29,935
and i sort of was brought in

1724
01:02:29,935 --> 01:02:32,785
to like um check out you know

1725
01:02:32,785 --> 01:02:35,725
these dinosaurs that have been made um

1726
01:02:35,815 --> 01:02:37,555
from the dna that they found in

1727
01:02:37,555 --> 01:02:39,775
like amber and fossils and stuff oh

1728
01:02:40,075 --> 01:02:41,455
i know and that's the only way

1729
01:02:41,455 --> 01:02:43,105
to do it it was a really

1730
01:02:43,105 --> 01:02:44,515
big thing so like we kind of

1731
01:02:44,515 --> 01:02:45,175
made

1732
01:02:45,565 --> 01:02:50,725
dinosaurs and they were aggressive and oh

1733
01:02:50,785 --> 01:02:52,645
i know it every couple years one

1734
01:02:52,645 --> 01:02:53,965
of them would get out or be

1735
01:02:53,965 --> 01:02:56,845
like kind of untenable will probably shut

1736
01:02:56,845 --> 01:02:59,125
that program down right no they kept

1737
01:02:59,125 --> 01:03:01,573
doing it they kept doing it yeah

1738
01:03:01,615 --> 01:03:04,225
okay they are interrelations they eventually clone

1739
01:03:04,225 --> 01:03:05,725
humans now

1740
01:03:05,725 --> 01:03:07,165
no the cutters kept thinking it'd be

1741
01:03:07,165 --> 01:03:08,665
fun to see a train of thought

1742
01:03:08,665 --> 01:03:10,465
i'm pretty sure they did nope they

1743
01:03:10,465 --> 01:03:11,755
