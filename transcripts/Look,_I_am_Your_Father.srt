00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:42,900
so she's younger than me according to

359
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,940
her like so she says she's in

360
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:46,740

371
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:09,180

373
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:12,780
asking you basically anything because because if

374
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:15,690
your bios basic yeah but but is

375
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:18,060

00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:20,070
i tell everyone i'm professional or just

377
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:21,480

379
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:23,610

380
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:26,580
what does she do she does she

381
00:14:26,591 --> 00:14:28,969
sort of come from that's the spanking

382
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:30,780
ten oh this is not the spanking

383
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:32,640
good baby it's a shame because this

384
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,410
cool cat on the it's okay is

385
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:35,610
that the spanking pet it's not even

386
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:38,100
a sharpie it's just some capitalists ballpoints

387
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,830
yeah oh this is no that's being

388
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:42,660
paying me indeed we need one of

389
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:43,860
those things a little hand

390
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:44,010
on

391
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:48,270
she has one share at one point

392
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:49,920
said she kind of said like i'm

393
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,630
actually older than that and then and

394
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:52,740
then when we tried to find out

395
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:55,320
the truth she wouldn't not go further

396
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:56,850
and then then i just my own

397
00:14:56,850 --> 00:14:59,610
sleuthing online so you're you're a creep

398
00:15:00,210 --> 00:15:01,830
yeah but it's most out of my

399
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:05,880
furious anger oh okay so far a

400
00:15:05,895 --> 00:15:08,010
furiously angry about it that bothers me

401
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:09,510
which is like the idea that you

402
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:10,650
get a lot of credit for being

403
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,090
as good as you are at a

404
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:14,940
young age oh so it's like twenty

405
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:16,650
two when you started and you're so

406
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:18,210
amazing and that twenty two and you

407
00:15:18,216 --> 00:15:19,410
got this thing and you did this

408
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:20,340
yeah and

409
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:22,470
then like then everyone's going like she's

410
00:15:22,470 --> 00:15:24,050
like a like a prodigy over the

411
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:26,310
other kids but she's not and then

412
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:27,450
i also feel like it's also fine

413
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:28,650
to have been working at something for

414
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:29,850

the funniest most interesting cool people that

643
00:24:11,625 --> 00:24:13,087

653
00:24:27,495 --> 00:24:28,144
ah that

654
00:24:28,215 --> 00:24:29,595
it would be a show to watch

655
00:24:29,595 --> 00:24:31,875
yeah like real like people who actually

656
00:24:31,875 --> 00:24:33,645
might connect on a personality level i

657
00:24:33,675 --> 00:24:34,875
don't know if i would want to

658
00:24:34,875 --> 00:24:36,255

659
00:24:36,255 --> 00:24:37,485

660
00:24:37,485 --> 00:24:38,955
like hey john i don't know i

661
00:24:38,955 --> 00:24:40,785

00:24:48,585 --> 00:24:50,205
i don't i don't watch those shows

665
00:24:50,265 --> 00:24:51,375
but i feel like a big part

666
00:24:51,375 --> 00:24:53,265
of their appeal is how horrible the

667
00:24:53,265 --> 00:24:55,365
people are right sort of but i

668
00:24:55,365 --> 00:24:56,742
can there are so many would you

669
00:24:56,742 --> 00:24:58,185
like me to chose when it's like

670
00:24:58,215 --> 00:24:59,655
oh my god they're can't believe they

671
00:24:59,655 --> 00:25:01,185
haven't had a deeper conversation than that

672
00:25:01,185 --> 00:25:02,235
at this point they're gonna get married

673
00:25:02,235 --> 00:25:04,695
like yeah watching the bachelorette last night

674
00:25:04,995 --> 00:25:06,885
i'm not giving anything away but it's

675
00:25:06,885 --> 00:25:08,505
like they i was

676
00:25:08,625 --> 00:25:10,035
the one of the guys says like

677
00:25:10,065 --> 00:25:11,865
oh she's so deep like we've shared

678
00:25:11,865 --> 00:25:12,975
so much about our lives and was

679
00:25:12,975 --> 00:25:14,955
like if it's anything that i've seen

680
00:25:15,015 --> 00:25:16,575
yeah don't you think kids out though

681
00:25:16,695 --> 00:25:17,955
maybe but i was like just kinda

682
00:25:17,955 --> 00:25:19,605
things been deep enough that like it

683
00:25:19,605 --> 00:25:20,865
really because they can't set up the

684
00:25:20,865 --> 00:25:23,145
cameras used all the time i know

685
00:25:23,145 --> 00:25:24,885
we've talked about it so but also

686
00:25:24,915 --> 00:25:26,535
i think that i don't think that

687
00:25:26,535 --> 00:25:27,765
they actually share i think the cameras

688
00:25:27,765 --> 00:25:28,695
are on most of the time

689
00:25:28,695 --> 00:25:30,135
i'm what they're when they're interacting with

690
00:25:30,135 --> 00:25:31,695
the guy but no remember they eat

691
00:25:31,695 --> 00:25:33,825
off camera before the dawn camera private

692
00:25:33,825 --> 00:25:34,845
i think i don't think it's yeah

693
00:25:34,875 --> 00:25:36,407
but that's what i'm saying is i

694
00:25:36,585 --> 00:25:38,505
don't think they're together oh they eat

695
00:25:38,505 --> 00:25:40,245
separately i think they didn't bring essay

696
00:25:40,275 --> 00:25:42,435
arrived the date having a separate them

697
00:25:42,435 --> 00:25:44,235
and they just eat before they just

698
00:25:44,265 --> 00:25:45,795
all day dates i'm saying that they

699
00:25:45,795 --> 00:25:48,735
eat first with the cameras off of

700
00:25:48,735 --> 00:25:48,855
it

701
00:25:49,425 --> 00:25:51,315
well yeah it was never clear how

702
00:25:51,315 --> 00:25:52,365
you just put on your jack i

703
00:25:52,395 --> 00:25:53,415
did i'm i have to go

704
00:25:54,615 --> 00:25:56,685
guys are talking on the bachelorette conversation

705
00:25:57,045 --> 00:25:59,655
ah yeah made me uncomfortable um yeah

706
00:25:59,655 --> 00:26:01,305
i don't know if it was if

707
00:26:01,305 --> 00:26:03,255
it was i guess it would be

708
00:26:04,275 --> 00:26:06,285
i guess i would feel more invested

709
00:26:06,285 --> 00:26:08,475
if it was people whose personalities i

710
00:26:08,505 --> 00:26:11,475
enjoyed yeah you know i guess i

711
00:26:11,479 --> 00:26:12,465
would be more but then i don't

712
00:26:12,465 --> 00:26:13,305
know if that would just make me

713
00:26:13,305 --> 00:26:14,715
more uncomfortable the idea

714
00:26:14,775 --> 00:26:17,085
of them competing i think what annoyed

715
00:26:17,085 --> 00:26:19,005
me would be interesting hurtful if he'll

716
00:26:19,005 --> 00:26:21,015
yeah had to have brain but well

717
00:26:21,015 --> 00:26:22,425
that's the thing because it's also a

718
00:26:22,425 --> 00:26:24,525
fitch people that if it's the type

719
00:26:24,525 --> 00:26:26,115
of people that are not usually the

720
00:26:26,115 --> 00:26:27,495
type of people that would be on

721
00:26:27,495 --> 00:26:29,535
one of these shows why would they

722
00:26:29,535 --> 00:26:30,765
be on the show hey you know

723
00:26:30,975 --> 00:26:32,745
to watch them compete it's like you

724
00:26:32,745 --> 00:26:34,395
really can't wrap my brain around warren

725
00:26:34,395 --> 00:26:34,935
was on the show

726
00:26:34,935 --> 00:26:37,815
show yeah and then she got duped

727
00:26:37,815 --> 00:26:38,805
by one of these guys like the

728
00:26:38,805 --> 00:26:40,485
bachelorette always seems to get duped by

729
00:26:40,485 --> 00:26:43,065
someone who has ill intentioned yeah there

730
00:26:43,075 --> 00:26:44,325
is not there for the right reasons

731
00:26:44,325 --> 00:26:45,705
he would be so interesting to see

732
00:26:45,705 --> 00:26:47,355
lauren get duped by way this is

733
00:26:47,355 --> 00:26:48,948
a common saying on the show yeah

734
00:26:48,948 --> 00:26:51,555
yeah oh mean like for for weeks

735
00:26:51,585 --> 00:26:53,745
wannabes what other reasonable like to be

736
00:26:53,745 --> 00:26:54,795
on t because they want to be

737
00:26:54,795 --> 00:26:55,095

00:26:58,665 --> 00:27:01,905
ram girlfriends back home who lawfully come

act like they knew it or did

748
00:27:14,079 --> 00:27:15,255
they act like they're surprised

749
00:27:15,767 --> 00:27:17,805
super surprised yeah but it'd be really

750
00:27:17,805 --> 00:27:19,365

feel surprised that i'm ever in a

situation i just never assumed i'd have

856
00:31:06,405 --> 00:31:07,905
to do that yeah that you always

857
00:31:07,905 --> 00:31:09,255
thought that you would get into acting

00:31:09,255 --> 00:31:10,275
i never have to kiss it like

859
00:31:10,275 --> 00:31:12,701

00:31:12,701 --> 00:31:13,875
you know what's funny i've i've done

861
00:31:13,875 --> 00:31:15,855

862
00:31:15,855 --> 00:31:18,255
of pilots where i played here ver

863
00:31:19,425 --> 00:31:20,925
you can't even do that anymore

864
00:31:21,795 --> 00:31:23,145
you gotta like try to kiss someone

865
00:31:23,145 --> 00:31:25,455
and they go harder in your face

866
00:31:26,235 --> 00:31:28,365
i've i've played i've played like husbands

867
00:31:28,365 --> 00:31:29,565
a couple of times in pilots and

868
00:31:29,565 --> 00:31:31,545
one i remember one where i hot

869
00:31:31,755 --> 00:31:33,885
where i had to kiss my wife

870
00:31:34,335 --> 00:31:35,595
and it was the first time i

871
00:31:35,685 --> 00:31:38,475
i had kissed a smoker after not

872
00:31:38,475 --> 00:31:40,185
being a smoker oh yeah and that

873
00:31:40,185 --> 00:31:41,085
was our row

874
00:31:41,355 --> 00:31:43,185
i've been realising like oh how many

875
00:31:43,665 --> 00:31:45,525
girls have i gone out with that

876
00:31:46,423 --> 00:31:47,385
about it where you kind of let

877
00:31:47,385 --> 00:31:49,460
it go but yeah it's like yeah

878
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:51,495
yeah i've dated when you think about

879
00:31:51,495 --> 00:31:54,105
it smokers and it's always gross to

880
00:31:54,105 --> 00:31:55,425
start but then i just think the

881
00:31:55,425 --> 00:31:57,405
human drive to do that shit just

882
00:31:57,405 --> 00:31:58,905
must be so intense that we just

883
00:31:58,965 --> 00:32:00,615
use the old gross shit you just

884
00:32:00,615 --> 00:32:01,245
end up going like

885
00:32:01,275 --> 00:32:03,135
who cares yeah but then i played

886
00:32:03,135 --> 00:32:06,495
a husband another time where ah we

887
00:32:06,495 --> 00:32:08,955
didn't kiss there was nothing written in

888
00:32:08,955 --> 00:32:10,305
there but there was also like there

889
00:32:10,305 --> 00:32:11,985
was a scene at the end where

890
00:32:11,985 --> 00:32:13,515
it was like are we in real

891
00:32:13,515 --> 00:32:15,495
life we will be with kiss yes

892
00:32:15,495 --> 00:32:17,265
yeah but then we were both kind

893
00:32:17,265 --> 00:32:18,585
of on the same page of like

894
00:32:18,615 --> 00:32:20,565
we don't need like one noise telling

895
00:32:20,565 --> 00:32:21,375
us to do it so we're not

896
00:32:21,405 --> 00:32:22,485
gonna do it right but then i

897
00:32:22,485 --> 00:32:24,945
remember thinking it's weird do you know

898
00:32:24,945 --> 00:32:26,595
what avi yeah like if you were

899
00:32:26,595 --> 00:32:28,935
watching that you'd be like huh but

900
00:32:29,535 --> 00:32:31,245
when they don't would you miss it

901
00:32:31,275 --> 00:32:33,195
if it wasn't there yeah you know

902
00:32:33,225 --> 00:32:35,535
but it seemed because i remember like

903
00:32:35,535 --> 00:32:37,245
spending a lot of time thinking like

904
00:32:37,335 --> 00:32:38,445
are they going to make us do

905
00:32:38,445 --> 00:32:40,755
this i'm ok you don't have a

906
00:32:40,755 --> 00:32:41,565
re but

907
00:32:41,595 --> 00:32:42,795
then after it was over i was

908
00:32:42,795 --> 00:32:44,535
like oh we probably should have because

909
00:32:44,535 --> 00:32:45,945
it seemed i think it is weird

910
00:32:45,945 --> 00:32:48,525
sometimes when you're in those roles and

911
00:32:48,555 --> 00:32:51,075
you don't have any physical yeah yeah

912
00:32:51,345 --> 00:32:53,085
yeah i always i also think it's

913
00:32:53,445 --> 00:32:54,825
your number if not making me doing

914
00:32:54,885 --> 00:32:56,595
when you're improving and it comes up

915
00:32:56,595 --> 00:32:57,855
and you do it is always never

916
00:32:57,855 --> 00:33:00,165
done improv i know i'm oh you

917
00:33:00,165 --> 00:33:01,275
mean improvising in

918
00:33:01,854 --> 00:33:02,655
and i've been able to get on

919
00:33:02,655 --> 00:33:04,275
stage like so easily i'm like i've

920
00:33:04,354 --> 00:33:06,165
never once been in a situation where

921
00:33:06,165 --> 00:33:07,245

923
00:33:09,345 --> 00:33:11,055
ask about the first time i had

924
00:33:11,055 --> 00:33:13,395
to kiss on stage i don't yes

925
00:33:13,425 --> 00:33:15,135
so i didn't tell that story about

926
00:33:15,135 --> 00:33:17,505
my creepy teacher yeah oh yeah yeah

927
00:33:17,535 --> 00:33:19,845
got away because everyone dolls you get

928
00:33:19,845 --> 00:33:21,465
up here and show and i've done

929
00:33:21,495 --> 00:33:21,885
yeah yeah

930
00:33:21,948 --> 00:33:24,045
but you were you just saying oh

931
00:33:24,045 --> 00:33:25,905
that they're kissing during improv in pro

932
00:33:25,905 --> 00:33:28,125
yeah oh it's like an unscreened like

933
00:33:28,125 --> 00:33:29,805
i like i always find it like

934
00:33:29,805 --> 00:33:31,005
because the moment is there and you

935
00:33:31,035 --> 00:33:32,565
know you should and you know you

936
00:33:32,565 --> 00:33:34,785
would as the person yeah hey but

937
00:33:34,785 --> 00:33:36,255
then again it's like usually for like

938
00:33:36,255 --> 00:33:37,815
janet varney i think was in something

939
00:33:37,815 --> 00:33:38,895
we were just like we're supposed to

940
00:33:38,895 --> 00:33:40,035
be walking down the street arm in

941
00:33:40,035 --> 00:33:41,655
arm and having a good time and

942
00:33:41,655 --> 00:33:41,895
we're

943
00:33:42,195 --> 00:33:44,085
we're married and it's like at that

944
00:33:44,085 --> 00:33:45,975
point where you're like well we would

945
00:33:45,975 --> 00:33:47,715
okay and it's just what it's like

946
00:33:47,715 --> 00:33:48,945
the kind of thing where i think

947
00:33:48,945 --> 00:33:50,745
it's difficult with improv because part of

948
00:33:50,745 --> 00:33:53,145
what makes it easier as an actor

949
00:33:53,145 --> 00:33:54,568
is like talking about it beforehand and

950
00:33:54,575 --> 00:33:55,815
knowing it's going to happen and mean

951
00:33:55,845 --> 00:33:57,435
right okay then won't kiss someone do

952
00:33:57,435 --> 00:34:00,126

953
00:34:00,126 --> 00:34:01,725

said song it's time to play pitches

978
00:35:17,055 --> 00:35:18,735
hit song one gives the name of

979
00:35:18,735 --> 00:35:20,325
a song and the other pitches of

980
00:35:20,325 --> 00:35:21,915
tv show based on the name of

981
00:35:21,915 --> 00:35:24,645
the song now i'm going to assume

982
00:35:25,065 --> 00:35:27,405
this these are popular songs yes you

983
00:35:27,405 --> 00:35:28,935
take ah pop songs that we all

984
00:35:28,935 --> 00:35:30,735
know the titles to and then you

985
00:35:30,735 --> 00:35:32,685
make up a sitcom

986
00:35:32,925 --> 00:35:35,445
just based on that titles man somebody

987
00:35:35,475 --> 00:35:37,665
wrinkle at the end somebody calling themselves

988
00:35:37,695 --> 00:35:42,435
certified huge boy johnny brad johnny briars

989
00:35:42,495 --> 00:35:46,365
says i like this thanks and the

990
00:35:46,365 --> 00:35:48,765
reverse someone invents the sitcom and someone

991
00:35:48,765 --> 00:35:50,295
has to sing the theme song well

992
00:35:50,355 --> 00:35:52,545
guess what i don't like that but

993
00:35:53,175 --> 00:35:54,675
but here's the new wrinkle that we

994
00:35:54,675 --> 00:35:57,465
decided we would do no rank to

995
00:35:57,495 --> 00:35:59,265
do to z and take a sog

996
00:35:59,775 --> 00:36:02,085
you take a songs take a song

997
00:36:02,085 --> 00:36:04,095
title you have to make a sitcom

998
00:36:04,095 --> 00:36:06,015
about it then come up with a

999
00:36:06,015 --> 00:36:07,785
theme song for the sitcom then i'd

1000
00:36:07,785 --> 00:36:09,735
take different i think the person who

1001
00:36:09,765 --> 00:36:11,475
came up who who pitched the song

1002
00:36:11,475 --> 00:36:13,005
title then has to come up with

1003
00:36:13,005 --> 00:36:14,775
the theme song to the sitcom that

1004
00:36:14,775 --> 00:36:16,725

who ah when he gets to a

1073
00:39:00,375 --> 00:39:03,795
crime scene he's blind he's deaf but

1074
00:39:03,795 --> 00:39:05,205
he's not until he gets the crime

1075
00:39:05,205 --> 00:39:07,305
scene once he gets good crime scene

1076
00:39:07,515 --> 00:39:08,865
he basically knows he's at a crime

1077
00:39:08,865 --> 00:39:11,475
scene when suddenly i do right right

1078
00:39:11,805 --> 00:39:12,525
his finger

1079
00:39:12,525 --> 00:39:15,015
chest who turned out the lights yeah

1080
00:39:15,105 --> 00:39:16,845
he says who turned off the sound

1081
00:39:17,325 --> 00:39:19,257
his his fingerprints have been shorn off

1082
00:39:19,257 --> 00:39:20,235
and he has no feeling in his

1083
00:39:20,235 --> 00:39:21,885
fingers he says who took away the

1084
00:39:21,885 --> 00:39:24,255
feeling and all you can do to

1085
00:39:24,255 --> 00:39:27,075
solve these crimes is to smell the

1086
00:39:27,105 --> 00:39:30,345
various bodily things that are out there

1087
00:39:30,345 --> 00:39:32,595

1290
00:47:39,625 --> 00:47:42,355
into tv now is usually we do

1296
00:47:53,755 --> 00:47:55,705
high five a wet hand hey of

1297
00:47:55,705 --> 00:47:59,215
course lotion on it of course lotion

1298
00:47:59,215 --> 00:48:01,195
wet hand with like microbeads yeah and

1299
00:48:01,195 --> 00:48:03,505
that really sloughs off the dead skin

1300
00:48:03,505 --> 00:48:06,205
making it very bad for the environment

1301
00:48:06,925 --> 00:48:08,275
yeah it says beat the don't call

1302
00:48:08,275 --> 00:48:11,005
away yeah yeah thank you so is

1303
00:48:11,035 --> 00:48:12,893
it okay so the idea is this

1304
00:48:12,893 --> 00:48:15,715
show called stairway to heaven okay religious

1305
00:48:16,195 --> 00:48:18,865
actually not oh so i think speaking

1306
00:48:18,895 --> 00:48:20,425
it's a show about people who all

1307
00:48:20,425 --> 00:48:23,395
are atheists okay who ah when they

1308
00:48:23,395 --> 00:48:25,045
died they realised they because they don't

1309
00:48:25,045 --> 00:48:26,305
believe in god they have to climb

1310
00:48:26,305 --> 00:48:27,625
all the stairs to get to heaven

1311
00:48:27,655 --> 00:48:30,265
instead of just going right now shore

1312
00:48:30,295 --> 00:48:31,165
and so along the way

1313
00:48:31,165 --> 00:48:33,715
way they saw the only difference in

1314
00:48:33,925 --> 00:48:36,115
trying to be in make a difference

1315
00:48:36,115 --> 00:48:37,075
here on earth is you have to

1316
00:48:37,075 --> 00:48:38,455
climb a few stairs to get to

1317
00:48:38,455 --> 00:48:40,885
heaven well i basically say i'm sure

1318
00:48:40,885 --> 00:48:42,265
it's more than a few right page

1319
00:48:42,355 --> 00:48:43,675
well that's the thing it's pays but

1320
00:48:43,675 --> 00:48:46,015
is there's a page that i'm making

1321
00:48:46,465 --> 00:48:48,985
there are hundreds and thousands of stairs

1322
00:48:49,045 --> 00:48:51,025
so of course episodes go lower because

1323
00:48:51,025 --> 00:48:51,325
on every

1324
00:48:51,325 --> 00:48:52,675
a few stairs is a whole new

1325
00:48:52,675 --> 00:48:55,075
love so a hundred thousand episodes could

1326
00:48:55,075 --> 00:48:56,815
it could be i would say probably

1327
00:48:57,385 --> 00:48:59,215
do the buy a fifth because i

1328
00:48:59,215 --> 00:49:01,375
think we can only make like ten

1329
00:49:01,825 --> 00:49:05,155
so okay total ten yeah so that's

1330
00:49:05,155 --> 00:49:07,345
great so i'll just have one episode

1331
00:49:07,345 --> 00:49:09,205
of her season no ten episodes one

1332
00:49:09,235 --> 00:49:11,155
oh ten sees ten seasons of one

1333
00:49:11,215 --> 00:49:11,485
eps

1334
00:49:11,545 --> 00:49:14,095
okay so it's very similar lost in

1335
00:49:14,095 --> 00:49:15,745
that everyone's kind of struggling with their

1336
00:49:15,745 --> 00:49:17,545
own stuff and as you climb the

1337
00:49:17,545 --> 00:49:19,585
stairs there's different sort of platforms of

1338
00:49:19,825 --> 00:49:22,705
of existence and they're all struggling to

1339
00:49:22,765 --> 00:49:24,235
battle their inner demons in order to

1340
00:49:24,235 --> 00:49:25,645
get them to heaven what about literal

1341
00:49:25,645 --> 00:49:27,175
demons are they battling though and of

1342
00:49:27,175 --> 00:49:29,185
course sometimes there are literal demons that

1343
00:49:29,185 --> 00:49:30,925
will jump out and attack it's very

1344
00:49:30,925 --> 00:49:31,645
similar really jump

1345
00:49:31,645 --> 00:49:34,585
pick up out from either husbands okay

1346
00:49:34,617 --> 00:49:36,805
was there a on hills or angels

1347
00:49:36,805 --> 00:49:40,285
in this oh you hispanic know i

1348
00:49:40,285 --> 00:49:43,915
am oh okay um there are olay

1349
00:49:43,945 --> 00:49:47,575
there are on health um and angels

1350
00:49:47,575 --> 00:49:49,975
so we both want to shoot it

1351
00:49:49,975 --> 00:49:51,805
in both spanish and english and

1352
00:49:51,805 --> 00:49:53,605
i'm playing the spanish and spanish speaking

1353
00:49:53,605 --> 00:49:56,815
countries bernie skeletons like crown she reverse

1354
00:49:56,825 --> 00:49:58,855
that play the english and spanish speaking

1355
00:49:58,855 --> 00:50:00,835
countries and vice versa well because people

1356
00:50:00,835 --> 00:50:03,385
wouldn't really understand exactly what they have

1357
00:50:03,385 --> 00:50:05,515
to do a little research okay i

1358
00:50:05,545 --> 00:50:06,655
think it's great so would you guys

1359
00:50:06,655 --> 00:50:07,225

1360
00:50:08,575 --> 00:50:10,705
did we get to the end at

1361
00:50:10,705 --> 00:50:12,655
the end everyone gets to heaven and

1362
00:50:12,655 --> 00:50:14,395
it's clear i'm it's gonna be very

1363
00:50:14,395 --> 00:50:16,525
clear what the whole allegory was in

1364
00:50:16,525 --> 00:50:18,475
that it's very blatant that it is

1365
00:50:18,475 --> 00:50:20,125
just climbing the stairs to heaven because

1366
00:50:20,125 --> 00:50:21,685

1367
00:50:21,685 --> 00:50:24,025
