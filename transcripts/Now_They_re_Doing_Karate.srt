1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:00,360
three

2
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:07,020
now they're doing karate

3
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:13,050
we must be cobra kai

4
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:18,332
oh yes welcome to three years what

5
00:00:18,332 --> 00:00:20,283
happened we're talking about the show this

6
00:00:20,283 --> 00:00:20,400
is

7
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,000
which i watch every week i've never

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,827
seen and now they're covering corona never

9
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:28,680
coming corona scots and i thought you

10
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,390
were gonna say she's lawrence you guys

11
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:33,000
now you're doing corona corona and scots

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,510
and i thought another to karate and

13
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:38,340
then we started very briefly riffing on

14
00:00:38,368 --> 00:00:40,200
the idea that i guess somehow the

15
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,760
producers of this are thinking

16
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,310
king cobra kai because he most popular

17
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:46,440
show on we gotta start doing karate

18
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,030
on the show i would love it

19
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:49,590
if every character on that had some

20
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:51,810
justification getting into goo that's how you

21
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:53,160
figure out that's how they all know

22
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:54,210
each other i don't know how they

23
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:55,920
like their family or whatever but they

24
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:58,080
definitely omitted to dojo or so they

25
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:00,150
definitely are family but i like the

26
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:01,590
the first episode of this is us

27
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,560
blew my mind not to be dramatic

28
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:06,360
but idea at the end of it

29
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:09,690
i went ah oh my god well

30
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:12,030
i say technically i still want to

31
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:13,740
see it's i don't want any spoilers

32
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,780
okay technically i was still so is

33
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:17,520
the best one oh and it's it

34
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,870
just gets worse and worse and worse

35
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:20,519
i watch it backwards i just mean

36
00:01:20,519 --> 00:01:22,080
because there's a good twist

37
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,760
and you're like wow but there's a

38
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,290
good there's too much like my three

39
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:28,500
last night okay and of course mandy

40
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,060
moore plays a sixty five year old

41
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,400
or older what yeah oh my god

42
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,290
are you serious i don't know yeah

43
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,570
because i always think about time travel

44
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:38,550
you know tell me anything about time

45
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:40,170
travel it's just a story of slide

46
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:42,240
back and forth yeah exactly don't tell

47
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,680
all my love this was a few

48
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,275
years ago after after some super bowl

49
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:48,450
couple of years ago they hyped up

50
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:51,060
like the season premiere of this zone

51
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:52,530
yeah it was happening after it yeah

52
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:54,900
yeah and so it got they really

53
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:55,830
hyped it up and so they got

54
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:58,015
all these people that has never hired

55
00:01:58,015 --> 00:02:00,360
show something yeah yeah okay they got

56
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,200
all these people that never seen that

57
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,040
show to watch it

58
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:05,400
and just i've never seen the show

59
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:08,430
but watching people's reactions to it online

60
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:10,710
like what is it like putting them

61
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,750
through a super bowl makes no sense

62
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:14,610
everyone's like oh and then you're like

63
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:18,060

have a football star like guest star

65
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:22,560

it on hey it's wide receiver i

67
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:26,700

00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:06,840
we have more of a claim to

115
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,100
the phrase this is us than the

116
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:10,410
show seriously we've been doing the show

117
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:11,280

118
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,230
since they started but well after they

119
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:15,810

grew them three them boys where we

126
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,600

127
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,710
that which i wrote down

00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,530
sure i was thinking of this in

131
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:41,610
the way here because i have this

132
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:43,890
gator adhere and it's blue and i

133
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:45,570
don't love that it's second time you've

134
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:47,190
said blue on the show what else

135
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:48,450
is able blew me away

136
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,510
harry re this is ice keeping track

137
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:53,190
of the different ways i say

138
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:55,620
it's my thing

139
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:00,030
i'm open to big what happens soon

140
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,710
like a very mild army job

141
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,750
i've one weird kid

142
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:08,580
talk about that um but like everyone

143
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:09,960
else has stopped i know but it's

144
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:12,690
still doing whatever it is month later

145
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:15,898
so um so it has blue one

146
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,880
and my question is if we didn't

147
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,920
put in any any die to these

148
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,870
things they'd be like brown and that's

149
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:22,170
why we

150
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,550
any okay so like weekly or ones

151
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:29,010
you think they put clear dion know

152
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,900
so maybe they're clear but why don't

153
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,340
we go maybe blue and it's like

154
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,170
well what why do i need it

155
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:35,610
to be blue can't you just i'd

156
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:38,130
rather be clear well it's isn't more

157
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:40,470
enticing so yeah like it's it's it's

158
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:42,750
something more than water doing something where

159
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:43,440
like there are fu

160
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,390
foods in nature that are blue that

161
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:47,010
it's supposed to remind you of like

162
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:49,860
blueberries or reminds me of zero whole

163
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:51,450
fruit you know what i mean i

164
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:52,770
think it's an old thing it's supposed

165
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:54,750
to be like it probably share yeah

166
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:57,241
oh glacier freeze thy get work i

167
00:05:57,312 --> 00:05:59,730
nailed it i burn even though ice

168
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:01,980
is clear it's reflecting the ocean so

169
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:03,540
that's why it's blue the ice is

170
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,550
reflecting the ocean in your freezer

171
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:09,480
i mean in name

172
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:14,280
ice isn't blue way but the you're

173
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,540
talking about like glue no no no

174
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:17,430
okay now the water is water right

175
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:19,560
ocean is clear as well yeah and

176
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,180
it's reflecting the sky that's what it

177
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:23,070
is so yeah oh yeah sky famously

178
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:26,580
blue yeah it gets it no what

179
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:29,730
is it he said blue oh i

180
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:30,720
thought it was a reference sky

181
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:32,070
famously blue that you were saying it's

182
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,810
sad when you see a picture of

183
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,160
a polar bear float okay are you

184
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,470
sampling ice cap oral and it's just

185
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:39,630
about to go die

186
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:43,440
and it's like hey photographer rings that

187
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,080

like physics or i don't know i'm

196
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:09,450

00:07:11,491 --> 00:07:12,990
assure she knows a lot about at

199
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:15,900
all women do now when did we

start all of us collectively as a

201
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,940
country caring that nick offerman makes things

202
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:21,120
out of

203
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:22,800
would ah

204
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,340
every suddenly was like you know he

205
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,529
woodworker i guess i should feel like

206
00:07:28,529 --> 00:07:29,965
that was like ten years ago yeah

207
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:31,290
i mean it was when parks and

208
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:33,030
rec started another thing on parks and

209
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:34,620
rec know i think it was a

210
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,480
thing of they made it because it

211
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,520
got popularized because like suddenly it was

212
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,500
like hey here's this actor who's very

213
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,820
funny on the show i mean it's

214
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:42,898
cool and and it

215
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,430
hard being written about like here's a

216
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:46,260
weird quirk i mean like what weird

217
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:47,640
quirk do you have that that people

218
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,560
should write about i fart in my

219
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,370
pillow before i go to bed

220
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,260
every night

221
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:54,450
it's always weird

222
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,270
they say it's unusual when you do

223
00:07:57,330 --> 00:07:57,780
i'm to say

224
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:01,230
only six nights not since harrison ford

225
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:02,400
have we cared this much about an

226
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,650
actor who can make a bookshelf this

227
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,510
he also make book shows a commenter

228
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:08,779
was not like jesus himself is christ

229
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:11,040
knew that yeah he he would ah

230
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:13,050
would destroy yeah he would do it

231
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:15,180
for directors and it's weird when you

232
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:16,650
see i know we've talked about this

233
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:17,970
but when you see someone like him

234
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:18,960
pop up like he's in

235
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:21,390
serpico as a cop with maybe one

236
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:23,040
line really yeah maybe one line or

237
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,450
maybe he's just standing in a hallway

238
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:26,220
slime someone has one less thing to

239
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:27,900
do that's harrison ford i think if

240
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:30,330
why are you ignoring him yeah he's

241
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:32,400
he's a major stuff and the guy

242
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,900
from star wars gonna be you should

243
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:36,360
say hi harrison ford we should decide

244
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,010
who movie stars are going to be

245
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,090
and then make

246
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,830
sure they never do roles like that

247
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:42,600
so it's not distracting in well i

248
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:45,420
just watched diehard for the first time

249
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:47,490
nigh yeah is this for ah one

250
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:48,990
of your for my patreon i did

251
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:50,370
a watch along if anyone wants and

252
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:51,840
you are like the guy from known

253
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:55,620
lighting why i was confused because i

254
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:56,790
was like what did he do before

255
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:58,800
this like he's what happened you know

256
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,280
and then we kind of

257
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:00,870
went into the character bruce willis re

258
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:02,640
so well is because a bruno of

259
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,470
course he was a bartender is but

260
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:05,730
for them was like jesus christ our

261
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:07,950
lord himself was just like random little

262
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:09,420
parts like man who walks into the

263
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:10,920
bar like literally his eye mtv is

264
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,570
that yeah a lot of experience because

265
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:14,100
he walked in one every night and

266
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,480
then go to he was on a

267
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:18,330
show for sixty episodes right before diehard

268
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:19,410
moonlighting

269
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,640
i don't think so is that a

270
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,890
show yeah yeah i thought it was

271
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:26,070
something else so it's all regardless i

272
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:28,500
thought oh that makes sense huh

273
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,390
because i was like how do you

274
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:32,700
become like such a huge star lie

275
00:09:32,745 --> 00:09:34,860
wow you're just being man who walked

276
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:36,376
into the bar one time well he

277
00:09:36,376 --> 00:09:37,980
didn't he got on moonlighting on the

278
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:41,670
already pretty early in his career absolutely

279
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:43,320
and that made him a massive star

280
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:44,730
yeah i'm going to scroll all the

281
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:45,900
way but more in this show was

282
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:48,690
huge moonlighting was you shy it was

283
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:49,200
like loss

284
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,270
just basically holy shit

285
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,810
did you just watch an episode we

286
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,460
lost i just paused the show and

287
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:58,726
you it for forty seven that part

288
00:09:58,726 --> 00:10:02,160
where it was like last um but

289
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,390
but yeah he was a huge part

290
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:04,770
of the cultural conversation and then he

291
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:07,080
became a movie star with comedies like

292
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,580
blind date and stuff but diehard was

293
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:09,600
the first time he had ever done

294
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,800
an action thing and people were like

295
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,000
really this comedy guy

296
00:10:13,155 --> 00:10:13,575
shimla

297
00:10:14,595 --> 00:10:16,035
so people weren't on board well so

298
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:17,835
they also unexplained something because one of

299
00:10:17,835 --> 00:10:19,365
the trivia facts about the movie was

300
00:10:19,365 --> 00:10:21,585
that they didn't put they took his

301
00:10:21,597 --> 00:10:22,965
picture off the post because they thought

302
00:10:22,965 --> 00:10:24,945
people wouldn't want to see him because

303
00:10:24,945 --> 00:10:26,655
yeah people just knew him as like

304
00:10:26,655 --> 00:10:28,815
the smirking kind of like funny guy

305
00:10:28,845 --> 00:10:30,345
that's so weird who was who would

306
00:10:30,405 --> 00:10:32,685
like do rapid fire dialogue on moonlighting

307
00:10:32,685 --> 00:10:34,271
and that's why they put the the

308
00:10:34,305 --> 00:10:34,725
original po

309
00:10:34,725 --> 00:10:36,135

00:19:11,985 --> 00:19:13,995
about the proposal and it isn't

557
00:19:14,085 --> 00:19:17,625
decent absolutely truly isn't it's indecent proposal

558
00:19:17,655 --> 00:19:19,965
but it's not something a decent person

559
00:19:19,965 --> 00:19:21,825
would ever propose to another do so

560
00:19:21,825 --> 00:19:23,625
for you and your husband get on

561
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:25,215
the same page ngo won't get this

562
00:19:25,215 --> 00:19:26,625
million dollars and then we're gonna pay

563
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:28,635
off whereby a house or do whatever

564
00:19:28,635 --> 00:19:29,955
you know whatever you want to do

565
00:19:29,955 --> 00:19:32,325
together with the money and they work

566
00:19:32,325 --> 00:19:33,735
this is what they did a movie

567
00:19:33,735 --> 00:19:34,245
then well

568
00:19:34,335 --> 00:19:36,345
let's forget this ever okay that's what

569
00:19:36,345 --> 00:19:37,785
they do in the movie okay so

570
00:19:37,785 --> 00:19:39,381
she doesn't know i do want to

571
00:19:39,381 --> 00:19:41,085
watch a roll around in the money

572
00:19:41,235 --> 00:19:43,245
there in vegas they like put it

573
00:19:43,245 --> 00:19:44,565
out on the bed this is where

574
00:19:44,565 --> 00:19:46,155
the trope of like rolling around in

575
00:19:46,155 --> 00:19:47,625
the money sort of conservative from that

576
00:19:48,135 --> 00:19:50,235
i can't think of it like another

577
00:19:50,235 --> 00:19:52,155
example of it on film before then

578
00:19:52,725 --> 00:19:54,285
i have told him saying dan

579
00:19:54,675 --> 00:19:55,875
then i don't think they invented like

580
00:19:55,875 --> 00:19:57,555
people would talk about data did it

581
00:19:57,555 --> 00:19:59,325
for sure but i don't think anyone

582
00:19:59,325 --> 00:20:01,065
ever in life no nil capture on

583
00:20:01,065 --> 00:20:02,385
film no yeah it's a lot like

584
00:20:02,385 --> 00:20:03,525
porn because it's too hard to get

585
00:20:03,585 --> 00:20:05,325
people to how to capture people doing

586
00:20:05,325 --> 00:20:06,765
it right you know what it is

587
00:20:06,795 --> 00:20:08,595
in documentary you're trying to do it

588
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:09,975
the money's not as much as you

589
00:20:09,975 --> 00:20:11,595
think it is like it doesn't really

590
00:20:11,595 --> 00:20:12,975
cover you well that's why would you

591
00:20:13,455 --> 00:20:14,531

no thanks so well in any case

635
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:42,820

636
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:44,410
they roll around in the money and

637
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:46,690
they're all happy but as you can

638
00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:49,660
expect that's only halfway through the film

639
00:21:49,690 --> 00:21:52,180
it's gonna get emotional then woody harrelson

640
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:54,970
can't take it and so he he

641
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,650
they fight all the time about it

642
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,390
because he thinks that she was too

643
00:21:58,390 --> 00:21:59,170
flip about

644
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,550
you know doing it and she doesn't

645
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:01,270
love him enough

646
00:22:02,290 --> 00:22:03,760
and then he's an architect so he

647
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,730
goes any e starts signs a building

648
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:09,250
that's like i hit my wife it's

649
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:10,630
like it's not gaza

650
00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:12,340
i call it i hate my wife

651
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:12,760
closet

652
00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:15,820
but they break up and he goes

653
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:17,320
and he he gives a lecture about

654
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:20,620
how every brick and leisure he every

655
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:23,800
brick can be an amazing building and

656
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:25,390
it sure it's just a break now

657
00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:26,500
but it could be a part of

658
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,150
an amazing thing and students are like

659
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:29,830
well you're fucking blow in my mind

660
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:32,620
i like that i forgot to build

661
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:34,870
you made the material yes and then

662
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:36,250
i forgot what happens after that but

663
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:39,190
um but but yeah alright but they

664
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:41,080
aren't what's amazing about that movie and

665
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:42,520
i can't remember if i've seen it

666
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:45,340
or not is that the the way

667
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:48,700
they get into such dire straits is

668
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:50,830
there's so stupid there

669
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:53,200
to stupid people they blow all their

670
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,710
money um you know with their businesses

671
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:58,540
blow so many times on the show

672
00:22:58,570 --> 00:23:00,070
ca all three of us i said

673
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:01,720
it was like losing blue

674
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,440
and then they're like okay here's our

675
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,010
plan

676
00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:09,699
go to vegas and gamble know who

677
00:23:09,699 --> 00:23:11,950
we're gonna win we're gonna win yes

678
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:14,230
it doesn't make any sense yeah idea

679
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:15,880
of gambling that money is the dumbest

680
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:17,800
don't ever go to vegas unless you

681
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,510
have money to lose that's the thing

682
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:20,110
i am

683
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:23,680
i go my i'll give myself a

684
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:26,945
budget for gambling yeah right exactly and

685
00:23:26,945 --> 00:23:28,810
you're fine losing it's done and that's

686
00:23:28,810 --> 00:23:31,150
just my play money and it's fun

687
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:33,910
because i will bet so low that

688
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:36,040
i'll make it last hours exactly exactly

689
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,540
having a good time the challenge all

690
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:38,890
but you're not betting the same thing

691
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:41,170
each hand or when i play roulette

692
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:43,540
which is just a random ass game

693
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:45,940
and it's like oh is it some

694
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:47,140
of the worst odds in vegas and

695
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:48,550
yeah but i had to look shit

696
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:50,350
i always thought there's the worst thing

697
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:51,370
is i always get to a point

698
00:23:51,370 --> 00:23:53,620
where i've i'm up like a lot

699
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:56,200
i when i somehow i'm down gone

700
00:23:56,290 --> 00:23:57,790
i once went to vegas tonight it

701
00:23:57,820 --> 00:23:59,560
i was doing i was doing the

702
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:00,460
whole like

703
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,640
ah bet the swingers thing

704
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,620
what happens there

705
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,380
i remember one part of that movie

706
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:10,330
and it's something about an answering machine

707
00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:12,790
i suspect that's the best part of

708
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:13,960
the movie yeah for sure it's a

709
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,340
good movie um but i was doing

710
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:16,480
the thing where you bet on red

711
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,980
each time you just double your bet

712
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:20,710
ah every time or different advice

713
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:25,270
oh absolutely your friend my snipes

714
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:29,658
ah but i was like you know

715
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,060
how i met him when i was

716
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:33,790
the fifty six passenger wow you know

717
00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:36,100
how hard it is to to for

718
00:24:36,130 --> 00:24:37,900
for it to be read like more

719
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:39,220
than eight times in a row or

720
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:40,600
something you know so that's what you're

721
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,820
basically betting on is like you you

722
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:44,290
bet five dollars and then if it

723
00:24:44,290 --> 00:24:45,730
doesn't come up red you bet ten

724
00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:46,450
and then you bet twenty

725
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:48,850
any then you bet forty at any

726
00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:50,560
bet eighty one hundred and sixty etc

727
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,940
and then finally like it'll end up

728
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:54,310
black and you win the original five

729
00:24:54,370 --> 00:24:56,650
here why i know like gamble okay

730
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:01,540
math oh lots of mad fun but

731
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:03,790
you know but the problems by like

732
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:05,440
yeah because you just go but there's

733
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,610
things on her like shit

734
00:25:06,610 --> 00:25:08,410
yep and i just put it yeah

735
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,790
and i just put it on different

736
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:11,380
numbers that mean something to me right

737
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:12,850
and then eventually it's gonna work out

738
00:25:12,910 --> 00:25:16,450
sixty nine six na and thirty five

739
00:25:16,690 --> 00:25:17,290
thirty four

740
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:21,820
then if it was very for do

741
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:24,400
it all and say what is michigan

744
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:35,710
is diarrhea unrelated ah

745
00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:38,830
that i had heard i think the

746
00:25:38,834 --> 00:25:40,630
sixty nine thing was based on like

747
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:42,400
positions of the kama sutra or whatever

748
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,600
then this is when i was a

749
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,980
kid and then finally someone explained to

750
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:46,390
me no it's because the nine in

751
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:47,830
the six are like opposites of each

752
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:49,720
other which is what you're because like

753
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,910
the the ball of the six is

754
00:25:52,116 --> 00:25:54,937

755
00:25:54,937 --> 00:25:56,470

gonna say about the roulette thing the

759
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:05,620
problem is is i did end up

760
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:07,000
getting to a point where it was

761
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,150
red or it was black ten times

762
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:11,350
in a row or something and then

763
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:13,060
you're just betting these insane sounds like

764
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:14,080

00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:20,920
dual five back and then it if

00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,330
it ever winds up on zero that's

770
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:23,800
the other thing and it's just loud

771
00:26:23,826 --> 00:26:25,990
double green but technically if you had

772
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:26,920
a lot of money you could just

773
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,420

the two in the commercial that's it

1077
00:36:54,650 --> 00:36:56,150
that's part of why it's even weirder

1078
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:58,040
it's like he's all like advertising this

1079
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:59,360

00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:01,220

i do it and then i just

1085
00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:07,760
thought even in his lie

00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,440
like self-effacing way where he talks about

1087
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,030
how bad he wasn't batman even though

1088
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:13,100
like he's not the problem in batman

1089
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:15,170

1090
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:17,270

1115
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:07,040

like that turbotax yeah

1117
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:10,400

1118
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:13,580
what actually do the job but i

1119
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:15,080
don't know it's kind of like a

1120
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:16,730
safe way to kind of buzz your

1121
00:38:16,730 --> 00:38:18,560
hair without going short it's like a

1122
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,570
vacuum thing so it is that qm

1123
00:38:20,570 --> 00:38:21,680
so it pulls it out of it's

1124
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,540
root it's pulled yet pulls it out

1125
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:26,240
of it's roots it's too powerful it's

1126
00:38:26,810 --> 00:38:27,860
it's a jet edge and

1127
00:38:28,430 --> 00:38:30,350
what no but vacuum technology what would

1128
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:32,960
it be for re one the hair

1129
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,030
so that it only cuts like trim

1130
00:38:35,030 --> 00:38:38,645
zil interesting yes super weird i i've

1131
00:38:38,690 --> 00:38:39,920

1140
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:59,480
but i i a cutlass its way

1141
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,146
makes hair so long ago but began

1142
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:03,950
to pandemic like day two and i

1143
00:39:03,950 --> 00:39:05,000
did such a horrible job and it

1144
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,590
looked like such shit like the back

1145
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:09,800
wasn't that bad really honestly yeah the

1146
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:11,630
was why couldn't you cut his hair

1147
00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:13,970
easy because when you did at it

1148
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,710
because what i did and i i

1149
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:18,260
kind of knew immediately what i did

1150
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:20,720
wrong instead of like cutting like

1151
00:39:20,810 --> 00:39:22,183
up into the hair i kind of

1152
00:39:22,256 --> 00:39:24,410
like crosby's weird lines

1153
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:28,880
i looked so fucking ugly and then

1154
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,170
i then we had someone come to

1155
00:39:30,170 --> 00:39:31,340
our porch and cut our hair in

1156
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:34,070
july and so i was like super

1157
00:39:34,070 --> 00:39:37,310
long scissors and yeah we had masks

1158
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:40,190
and we were outside right and she's

1159
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:43,130
she was fantastic but it's pretty expensive

1160
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:43,880
and then i was like no i

1161
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:44,750

1162
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:45,680

1165
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:53,810
when i did my first of december

1166
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:57,140
january um that's a long time that's

1167
00:39:57,140 --> 00:39:58,700
a really long time to not have

1168
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:00,740
a haircut well how's he look though

1169
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:02,150
do you like it well he's had

1170
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:03,905
longish hair so at some points it's

1171
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,000
all it's not horrible but it's like

1172
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:05,780

1173
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:07,130

so you go into the workout room

1351
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:54,100
you grab a twenty five pound weight

1352
00:46:54,412 --> 00:46:57,250
hold on each arm and you slowly

1353
00:46:57,430 --> 00:47:00,220
just hold the yeah yeah these guys

1354
00:47:00,250 --> 00:47:02,890
like oh let's drop this happens is

1355
00:47:02,890 --> 00:47:04,600
your head is down in the pool

1356
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:05,890
but your feet are flowing to the

1357
00:47:05,890 --> 00:47:07,870
top for your whole rice the weight

1358
00:47:07,870 --> 00:47:08,350
so it's key

1359
00:47:08,350 --> 00:47:10,630
keeping you down he he drops them

1360
00:47:10,630 --> 00:47:13,030
two issues here i got it i

1361
00:47:13,030 --> 00:47:14,440
have an elegant solution here i give

1362
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:15,310
an elegant so it was kind of

1363
00:47:15,310 --> 00:47:17,890
floating like mario and water elegant balloons

1364
00:47:17,980 --> 00:47:20,380
i put the i get down in

1365
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:23,170
there right down in there and i

1366
00:47:23,170 --> 00:47:25,210
put the bar of the weight on

1367
00:47:25,210 --> 00:47:26,920
the back of my neck that'll kill

1368
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:28,510
ya so that i'm my

1369
00:47:28,545 --> 00:47:31,150
head is like down there and then

1370
00:47:31,150 --> 00:47:32,740
it's awkward i can't get the weight

1371
00:47:32,740 --> 00:47:34,660
off okay but you don't want to

1372
00:47:35,050 --> 00:47:37,180
but i don't want to exactly well

1373
00:47:37,180 --> 00:47:39,280
no point i use a finger i'm

1374
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:42,040
the nicest guy i can't lift that

1375
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:43,360
weight at that point so at that

1376
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:46,180
point i'm just going screaming the thing

1377
00:47:46,180 --> 00:47:47,680
about the weights is the will to

1378
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:48,670
survive always sue

1379
00:47:48,670 --> 00:47:51,490
supersedes the desire not to so that's

1380
00:47:51,490 --> 00:47:53,020
why you have to do the weights

1381
00:47:53,050 --> 00:47:54,580
you know but you can't just hold

1382
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:55,960
the weight so you have to like

1383
00:47:56,230 --> 00:47:58,570
make them and like where you can't

1384
00:47:58,570 --> 00:48:00,160
get them off when that child crying

1385
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:01,690
masha that's what i'm saying that's why

1386
00:48:01,690 --> 00:48:02,500
i put on the back nine yeah

1387
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:03,340
it's it's grim

1388
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:08,560
but i think it's funnier if you

1389
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:09,760
don't have any weights at all you

1390
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:11,450
just decide to walk into the pool

1391
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:12,940
like that too and then for some

1392
00:48:12,940 --> 00:48:14,410
reason the pool keeps getting deeper and

1393
00:48:14,410 --> 00:48:15,580
deeper and you're just walking there's like

1394
00:48:15,580 --> 00:48:16,750
a whole set of stairs we can't

1395
00:48:16,750 --> 00:48:18,040

1396
00:48:19,150 --> 00:48:22,960

bummer for all involved i agree but

1524
00:52:35,235 --> 00:52:36,705
there were several times on tour paul

1525
00:52:36,705 --> 00:52:39,315
where where like you weren't responding to

1526
00:52:39,315 --> 00:52:41,175
texts or phone calls we thought you

1527
00:52:41,175 --> 00:52:44,685
died maybe three times oh and where

1528
00:52:44,685 --> 00:52:45,255
i was like

1529
00:52:45,285 --> 00:52:47,475
honestly we had was we have the

1530
00:52:47,475 --> 00:52:50,295
hotel call you and then like because

1531
00:52:50,385 --> 00:52:51,435
we couldn't get through to you i

1532
00:52:51,435 --> 00:52:53,085
remember because i had that one time

1533
00:52:53,265 --> 00:52:55,785
my brilliant plan backfired yes one yeah

1534
00:52:55,815 --> 00:52:57,285
but i think there were three three

1535
00:52:57,345 --> 00:52:59,355
separate times where i was like oh

1536
00:52:59,355 --> 00:53:00,675
no i was like i don't know

1537
00:53:00,675 --> 00:53:01,905
what i'm going to do i was

1538
00:53:01,935 --> 00:53:04,515
i was calculating know who can i

1539
00:53:04,515 --> 00:53:05,415
call to fly

1540
00:53:05,415 --> 00:53:07,995
fly out to replace him that's psychotic

1541
00:53:07,995 --> 00:53:10,845
different different thoughts different thoughts i was

1542
00:53:10,845 --> 00:53:13,245
so worried i was like some things

1543
00:53:13,335 --> 00:53:15,225
wrong but then the third time i

1544
00:53:15,225 --> 00:53:16,785
thought okay now we just sleep now

1545
00:53:16,785 --> 00:53:18,765
this is just a thing but yeah

1546
00:53:18,765 --> 00:53:19,761
there were a couple of times i

1547
00:53:20,055 --> 00:53:22,215
realised i was causing such a panic

1548
00:53:22,215 --> 00:53:25,305
i apologize it was a slow panic

1549
00:53:25,305 --> 00:53:25,575
that was

1550
00:53:25,575 --> 00:53:26,235
is like

1551
00:53:27,375 --> 00:53:29,505
the the longer is possibly be what

1552
00:53:29,505 --> 00:53:30,795
i think because i always think everyone

1553
00:53:30,795 --> 00:53:33,345
died basically instantly anyway like yeah as

1554
00:53:33,345 --> 00:53:34,365
soon as you don't see them anymore

1555
00:53:34,365 --> 00:53:35,955
yeah well like that person's dead okay

1556
00:53:35,955 --> 00:53:38,295
something horrible happens right

1557
00:53:38,325 --> 00:53:40,215
sorry your dad like if i if

1558
00:53:40,215 --> 00:53:42,345
i'm waiting for someone in their late

1559
00:53:42,345 --> 00:53:43,635
or you know whatever anything you know

1560
00:53:43,635 --> 00:53:46,515
anytime coop comes downstairs maybe fifteen minutes

1561
00:53:46,515 --> 00:53:49,035
later than she's she usually does i'm

1562
00:53:49,035 --> 00:53:51,315
like oh for christ's sake i hope

1563
00:53:51,465 --> 00:53:53,625
it's not happening jam dead all the

1564
00:53:53,625 --> 00:53:55,815
time she thinks i'm dead all the

1565
00:53:56,055 --> 00:53:56,325
time

1566
00:53:59,025 --> 00:54:00,615
that's terrible i always see my coming

1567
00:54:00,615 --> 00:54:02,895
back i don't go said latino i

1568
00:54:03,045 --> 00:54:04,755
i really do the thing i've fucked

1569
00:54:04,755 --> 00:54:06,652
because i can't say my wife like

1570
00:54:06,652 --> 00:54:06,975
this

1571
00:54:07,605 --> 00:54:09,975
you can't say anything partner but i

1572
00:54:09,975 --> 00:54:12,075
think mike said she'll show up with

1573
00:54:12,075 --> 00:54:12,795
so shiny

1574
00:54:13,095 --> 00:54:14,505
yeah i'm talking about the same you're

1575
00:54:14,505 --> 00:54:16,485
talking about okay

1576
00:54:18,075 --> 00:54:19,935
i can only say something times that

1577
00:54:19,935 --> 00:54:22,005
i think my my lot right

1578
00:54:22,755 --> 00:54:25,185
but it's terrifying when someone's sleeping really

1579
00:54:25,185 --> 00:54:26,625
late or something and then you're like

1580
00:54:27,975 --> 00:54:29,655
but jamie's also if people don't respond

1581
00:54:29,655 --> 00:54:32,595
to her text within thirty seconds she's

1582
00:54:32,595 --> 00:54:34,305
like why is this person writing me

1583
00:54:34,305 --> 00:54:36,195
back so like like

1584
00:54:37,335 --> 00:54:39,075
wow what they're doing but i will

1585
00:54:39,075 --> 00:54:41,775
have that about with a text like

1586
00:54:41,805 --> 00:54:43,695
they hate me they're mad at me

1587
00:54:44,055 --> 00:54:45,795
they hate that i texted that i

1588
00:54:45,795 --> 00:54:47,745
will say a problem there but how

1589
00:54:47,745 --> 00:54:50,775
much time do you let elapse hours

1590
00:54:50,775 --> 00:54:52,155
like i mean i think like if

1591
00:54:52,155 --> 00:54:53,445
it gets three hours and i go

1592
00:54:53,535 --> 00:54:55,065
i'll remember oh that person never wrote

1593
00:54:55,065 --> 00:54:56,865
me back and then i'll think this

1594
00:54:56,865 --> 00:54:57,435
is minutes

1595
00:54:57,495 --> 00:54:59,055

co-workers cube each other because ship you

1703
00:58:57,645 --> 00:58:59,295

1751
01:00:52,005 --> 01:00:52,935
sounds like an incredible

1752
01:00:53,782 --> 01:00:55,185
i mean well first of all i

1753
01:00:55,185 --> 01:00:57,375
always think parents are too quiet i've

1754
01:00:57,375 --> 01:00:58,845

1846
01:04:56,715 --> 01:05:00,705
the parrot's perch directly outside the residence

no choice but to take it personally

1850
01:05:09,705 --> 01:05:12,555
because it sounds personal whoa i love

1851
01:05:12,555 --> 01:05:14,775

1852
01:05:14,775 --> 01:05:15,945
that you have to talk to each
