65
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:45,090

character says did you guys see that

70
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,290

73
00:02:58,230 --> 00:02:58,950
shit

74
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,460
welcome to the show everyone that it's

75
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:04,200
hard to do this without a title

76
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,940
we don't know what the title of

77
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:09,030
the show is oh let's explain first

78
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:11,011
of all why we want to do

79
00:03:11,011 --> 00:03:12,270
at a show but then we'll talk

80
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:13,590
about the title and what we're gonna

81
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:15,300
do about that we should explain ourselves

82
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:18,930
yeah explain yourself well i will here's

83
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:19,380
the thing

84
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:23,850
scott lauren myself i'm not gonna lie

85
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:25,710
we have a good time together we

86
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:29,730
do we work together we've got to

87
00:03:29,733 --> 00:03:31,800
admit it that's right it's a como

88
00:03:31,804 --> 00:03:35,070
joan i hate you guys see that's

89
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:36,900
what he's like and that's why it's

90
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:39,510
fun but we i think probably this

91
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:40,320
this really stir

92
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,910
dated when we were on the tour

93
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,820
too is that two years ago oh

94
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:46,260
the year after year and half ago

95
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,240
yeah and obviously there's a lot of

96
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,820
time ah a lot of downtown downtime

97
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:52,050
where we're hanging like you're only on

98
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:54,690
stage for one two hours at night

99
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,860
two and a half hours that one

100
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,180
time yeah new york that was a

101
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:00,360
mistake oh but um we really had

102
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:00,450
a

103
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,340
good time together and and for for

104
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:05,100
an experience like that where it's it's

105
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,140
it can it verged on grueling that

106
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:08,730
tour where we were traveling a lot

107
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:12,240
it would be very easy to despise

108
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,740
the people that you're spending every day

109
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:15,510
with yeah i can see why some

110
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:19,530
people in band's breakup immediately never speak

111
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:20,550
to each other anymore i've never

112
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,920
thought of it like that but yeah

113
00:04:21,933 --> 00:04:23,370
makes sense but we all really got

114
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:25,920
along really really missed each other after

115
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,690
the tour it's true that's right and

116
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:29,100
we missed hanging out with each other

117
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:32,280
and sometimes we go ah to places

118
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,170
together and we go we win vacation

119
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:36,330
together the summer why yeah that's true

120
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:38,370
and we said why not actually do

121
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:40,800
a show this actually also started when

122
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:42,630
when we were doing the tour recaps

123
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:46,470
episode yeah comedy bang bang yeah scott

124
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:47,790
you've had it to where the

125
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:53,190
yeah we did them all together and

126
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:54,960
we said you know what each of

127
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,840
our shows each of our shows varying

128
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,140
just a mess using our shows is

129
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:04,020
very difficult to do yes yes ah

130
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:07,350
both in booking and ah having to

131
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:09,120
do comedy the entire time yeah

132
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,880
yes yeah you have to like be

133
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,620
funny the whole time yeah and you

134
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:15,870
have to book one at least for

135
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:17,280
you at least one person for our

136
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,399
shows sometimes three sometimes four and even

137
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:20,820
not just the booking i have to

138
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:22,710
hope that they could can handle it

139
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:24,150
they have to improvise for an hour

140
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:26,520
and then people get very nervous that's

141
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,470
why you wear a t-shirt to every

142
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:29,280
recording says can

143
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,870
you handle it yeah and then if

144
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:32,070
they can't they walk right out and

145
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:33,660
what did they think your teachers saying

146
00:05:33,687 --> 00:05:35,310
can you handle this like your actual

147
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:37,890
body honestly most episodes of my podcast

148
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,030
or them trying to figure out what

149
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:41,160
my t-shirts about and yeah it works

150
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,440
every time you believe i love your

151
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,870
show love it but we said why

152
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:47,040
not do a show where we just

153
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,300
kinda talk to each other we have

154
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:49,440
so much fun doing us all

155
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:51,390
so with comedy bang bang where laura

156
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:52,530
and i are doing characters you're kind

157
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:54,300
of doing carolina doing charger and i'm

158
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,190
having to do this kind of artificial

159
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,560
you know sarcastic you know ironic thing

160
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,390
so when i play like this dumb

161
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:03,030
guy ah hey polls don't do like

162
00:06:03,035 --> 00:06:04,530
i can dupe an idiot that doesn't

163
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:05,190
get things

164
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,520
um and that's part of our relationship

165
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,290
on comedy bang bang which will not

166
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:12,120

00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:25,800
if it was carolyn like sixty minutes

174
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:26,400

00:08:30,588 --> 00:08:33,570
sale one yeah well he thought that

235
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:35,010
meant that there would be a whole

236
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:37,920
tape full of episodes um just rip

237
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:38,610

238
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:39,660
i watched so much all my children

239
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:40,770
growing up did you actually watch that

240
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,690
show i've never watched that i watched

241
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:44,940
general hospital oh okay in the days

242
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:46,410
of ah luke and laura and the

243
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:48,030
ice princess and all this yes it

244
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:49,410
was like they tried to make it

245
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:51,210
the soap opera became sort of like

246
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:52,770
an anti bias kind of way yeah

247
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,570
looks like grasser like a james bond

248
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:56,280
yeah you don't know well yeah they

249
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,050
did eventually do other worldly stuff

250
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,970
like there was there were alien alien

251
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:01,290
thing yeah yeah do you think a

252
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:02,940
soap opera could ever be as important

253
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:04,650
as they were at that time because

254
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:05,850
no one cares now because there's so

255
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:09,240
many shows i i well i think

256
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,320
that the fact that they're all kind

257
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,471
of dying out is are they yeah

258
00:09:12,501 --> 00:09:13,710
bunch of them have have gone off

259
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:15,088
the air i liked it i liked

260
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:16,487
it they still exist though yeah and

261
00:09:16,487 --> 00:09:17,700
i hope they always do i think

262
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:18,240
that they will

263
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,230
i'll be more important

264
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,960
i think they'll be our most important

265
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,520
form of expression i think shows will

266
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:26,280
eventually be as biggest seinfeld again some

267
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:29,280
shows yes oh wait aqua teen hunger

268
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,420

276
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:46,890

the show forth on july fourth we

414
00:14:27,265 --> 00:14:28,645

be in the show and we kind

416
00:14:30,415 --> 00:14:32,605
of bitch some ideas and now about

417
00:14:32,605 --> 00:14:34,495
this this is simple because the whole

418
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:35,725
idea was to keep this as simple

419
00:14:35,725 --> 00:14:37,525
as possible and we're like great kids

420
00:14:37,525 --> 00:14:39,235
and we give it simple shithead

421
00:14:41,335 --> 00:14:43,705
will be the new kids yep which

422
00:14:43,705 --> 00:14:44,575
one do you want to be the

423
00:14:44,575 --> 00:14:45,985

i'm the star man and the ah

426
00:14:52,195 --> 00:14:53,845
that would look insane both of those

427
00:14:53,845 --> 00:14:55,345
things on top of each other they

428
00:14:55,345 --> 00:14:57,115
would ruin it i think probably it

429
00:14:57,115 --> 00:14:59,455
would ruin two great things i love

430
00:14:59,455 --> 00:15:01,765
cancers so cool and thirty here the

431
00:15:02,335 --> 00:15:03,925

the demon the idea of putting that

00:15:13,825 --> 00:15:15,625
on over and over again is one

439
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:17,335
of the most depressing thoughts i did

440
00:15:17,335 --> 00:15:19,015

00:16:40,855 --> 00:16:42,775
like sex in general is so gross

486
00:16:42,775 --> 00:16:44,575
that people must really want to have

487
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:46,855

560
00:19:18,415 --> 00:19:19,855
tell yourself that i read the first

561
00:19:19,855 --> 00:19:21,985
four books and then i didn't read

562
00:19:21,985 --> 00:19:23,395
anymore and then i saw the movies

563
00:19:23,395 --> 00:19:24,445
and i didn't really pay attention to

564
00:19:24,445 --> 00:19:25,765
entertain anything i didn't notice that they

565
00:19:25,765 --> 00:19:27,535
said it differently and i saw on

566
00:19:27,535 --> 00:19:29,185
twitter that it was different i saw

567
00:19:29,185 --> 00:19:30,985
the first movie in the first book

568
00:19:31,015 --> 00:19:32,515
and i read the first book and

569
00:19:32,515 --> 00:19:33,265
then i was out and then the

570
00:19:33,265 --> 00:19:35,155
movies as they went on started to

571
00:19:35,155 --> 00:19:36,745
look better to me they started look

572
00:19:36,745 --> 00:19:38,425
more intriguing but i

573
00:19:38,575 --> 00:19:40,525
just couldn't make myself do it i

574
00:19:40,525 --> 00:19:43,945
liked the third movie that ah harry

575
00:19:43,949 --> 00:19:45,625
potter in the end harry potter and

576
00:19:45,625 --> 00:19:47,605
the end he just likes waiting for

577
00:19:47,665 --> 00:19:50,845
the end everybody by chops and he

578
00:19:50,845 --> 00:19:53,275
seals off i don't ruin i'm off

579
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:54,775
to see the snow

580
00:19:56,395 --> 00:19:57,235
wizard i don't know

581
00:19:58,465 --> 00:20:00,235
i kind of go well let's talk

582
00:20:00,235 --> 00:20:04,045
about this title alright okay what do

583
00:20:04,045 --> 00:20:05,065
you want it to be

584
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:08,015
you're in the middle of saying something

585
00:20:08,045 --> 00:20:10,085
i thought then we didn't talk about

586
00:20:10,085 --> 00:20:13,625
it again until yesterday okay initially we

587
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:15,725
thought it would be called threesome yes

588
00:20:15,995 --> 00:20:17,495
and then we pretend like type random

589
00:20:17,495 --> 00:20:18,785
but three people and then we talked

590
00:20:18,785 --> 00:20:19,565
about all the different ways it could

591
00:20:19,565 --> 00:20:21,395
be spelled because we were talking about

592
00:20:21,425 --> 00:20:23,585
the the number three and then dmb

593
00:20:23,615 --> 00:20:25,265
and then we talked about t h

594
00:20:25,265 --> 00:20:27,035
r e d oh yeah right right

595
00:20:27,395 --> 00:20:28,385
and then that was pretty much it

596
00:20:28,445 --> 00:20:30,845
and everyone we've than we were at

597
00:20:30,845 --> 00:20:32,675
comic-con and we said hey we have

598
00:20:32,705 --> 00:20:34,235
oh we also had another title which

599
00:20:34,235 --> 00:20:38,975

00:20:38,975 --> 00:20:40,955

tom tom focus tom kiss me or

603
00:20:45,635 --> 00:20:47,195
some already not good well we

604
00:20:47,195 --> 00:20:49,475
we at comic-con we were doing a

605
00:20:49,475 --> 00:20:51,935
panel when we said hey we're doing

606
00:20:51,935 --> 00:20:53,495
a show and then we said it's

607
00:20:53,525 --> 00:20:54,965
either going to be this title or

608
00:20:54,965 --> 00:20:56,375
this time when we said both and

609
00:20:56,375 --> 00:20:58,355
no one liked either everyone was like

610
00:20:58,355 --> 00:21:00,065
we don't care we're pretty quiet throughout

611
00:21:00,065 --> 00:21:02,105
that whole thing we thought this is

612
00:21:02,105 --> 00:21:03,755
gonna win we drop this revelation on

613
00:21:03,755 --> 00:21:05,285
their heads and they were like people

614
00:21:05,285 --> 00:21:06,415
were excited about the show they were

615
00:21:06,415 --> 00:21:06,665
like that

616
00:21:08,975 --> 00:21:11,315
yeah no one likes either title so

617
00:21:11,315 --> 00:21:14,525
then that's that's maybe been something that's

618
00:21:14,525 --> 00:21:15,905
been standing in the way of us

619
00:21:15,965 --> 00:21:17,945
even recording for while because we don't

620
00:21:17,945 --> 00:21:19,265
have a real title yeah and it

621
00:21:19,265 --> 00:21:20,225
seemed like people weren't into it

622
00:21:21,845 --> 00:21:24,240
it was just the title so what

623
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,895
we decided to do i'm eating on

624
00:21:25,895 --> 00:21:27,995
the podcast discussion wouldn't know that's what

625
00:21:28,055 --> 00:21:29,015
this is the kind of show is

626
00:21:29,405 --> 00:21:30,455
what we decided to do is we

627
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:33,035
decided to record the first episode and

628
00:21:33,035 --> 00:21:35,405
we have our trusty assistant korean over

629
00:21:35,405 --> 00:21:38,015
here and she is writing down things

630
00:21:38,015 --> 00:21:40,265
that we say although she's not writing

631
00:21:40,265 --> 00:21:41,435
a lot i have to say she's

632
00:21:41,435 --> 00:21:43,025
is writing more than i thought there's

633
00:21:43,025 --> 00:21:45,005
a lot of legend way more than

634
00:21:45,005 --> 00:21:46,355
i expected she's got a david e

635
00:21:46,385 --> 00:21:48,425
kelley legal pad in front of her

636
00:21:49,085 --> 00:21:50,495
from dallas early a lot of people

637
00:21:50,495 --> 00:21:51,515
don't know he used to write his

638
00:21:51,515 --> 00:21:53,015
shows on illegal but he still doesn't

639
00:21:53,015 --> 00:21:55,925
seem comfortable right writing on legal pads

640
00:21:55,925 --> 00:21:57,665
because he's a lawyer what's more comfortable

641
00:21:57,665 --> 00:21:59,975
than writing longhand entire scott

642
00:22:00,665 --> 00:22:02,285
a tweet from i guess the writer

643
00:22:02,285 --> 00:22:04,415
of bill and ted's excellent adventure and

644
00:22:04,415 --> 00:22:06,125
it's was written like he found the

645
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:07,505
first pages of description was all written

646
00:22:07,505 --> 00:22:08,405
on paper like that and i was

647
00:22:08,405 --> 00:22:10,595
like do people do that like he

648
00:22:10,595 --> 00:22:12,335
wrote it on paper i'm not trying

649
00:22:12,335 --> 00:22:15,065
to be funny well anyways it accomplished

650
00:22:16,745 --> 00:22:18,035
well lauren that's one thing if you're

651
00:22:18,035 --> 00:22:19,115

653
00:22:21,095 --> 00:22:22,535
of us but don't know the overall

654
00:22:22,535 --> 00:22:24,204
which seems insane where's he going with

655
00:22:25,565 --> 00:22:27,545
lauren is a little bit younger than

656
00:22:27,545 --> 00:22:28,775

00:22:32,885 --> 00:22:34,535
my age because i think that's lame

660
00:22:34,595 --> 00:22:37,715
so did i until i crossed a

661
00:22:37,715 --> 00:22:40,215
certain barrier oh honey it gets worse

662
00:22:40,265 --> 00:22:41,255

667
00:22:50,555 --> 00:22:53,255
paul and i know so yeah let's

668
00:22:53,255 --> 00:22:56,165
just say i'm shocked someone ever used

669
00:22:56,165 --> 00:22:58,595
paper i know but i must say

670
00:22:58,595 --> 00:23:01,415
as someone who wrote in the years

671
00:23:01,415 --> 00:23:02,555
before computers in fact

672
00:23:02,585 --> 00:23:04,535
my very first script i wrote on

673
00:23:04,535 --> 00:23:06,725
a a type of computer where it

674
00:23:06,725 --> 00:23:09,095
would only save twenty five pages you

675
00:23:09,095 --> 00:23:10,445
could only let you print it and

676
00:23:10,445 --> 00:23:12,065
then you had to print it and

677
00:23:12,065 --> 00:23:14,405
copy it and then deleted all and

678
00:23:14,405 --> 00:23:16,565
then write another daddy's name knots yeah

679
00:23:16,565 --> 00:23:18,335
so i was writing at the time

680
00:23:18,335 --> 00:23:20,915
when computers weren't around wow you know

681
00:23:20,915 --> 00:23:22,475
everything was like typewriters before that

682
00:23:22,745 --> 00:23:23,615
then i went so it was that

683
00:23:23,615 --> 00:23:24,665
just really annoying to write on a

684
00:23:24,665 --> 00:23:27,155
typewriter so it would just be lazy

685
00:23:27,155 --> 00:23:28,625
burn yeah row plays on typewriter and

686
00:23:28,625 --> 00:23:30,245
you're constantly making mistakes and having a

687
00:23:30,245 --> 00:23:32,075
wide ow oh yeah like i remember

688
00:23:32,075 --> 00:23:33,755
doing it for papers in school i

689
00:23:33,755 --> 00:23:36,785
remember writing sketches in longhand i wrote

690
00:23:36,785 --> 00:23:38,345
plays in longhand completely and then i

691
00:23:38,345 --> 00:23:40,800
would type them later that's cool yeah

692
00:23:40,805 --> 00:23:42,545
it's very good was really cool oh

693
00:23:42,545 --> 00:23:42,875
my god

694
00:23:42,875 --> 00:23:44,525
odd when people saw you doing it

695
00:23:45,425 --> 00:23:47,675
looking at you go to dan and

696
00:23:47,885 --> 00:23:49,445
gord you alright girdwood

697
00:23:51,035 --> 00:23:52,565
do you think frank underwood was named

698
00:23:52,565 --> 00:23:55,745
after the typewriter absolutely yeah ray i

699
00:23:55,775 --> 00:23:57,575
feel like part of the story of

700
00:23:57,575 --> 00:23:58,895
house of cards is that he used

701
00:23:58,895 --> 00:24:00,785
to be a typewriter and then make

702
00:24:00,785 --> 00:24:02,825
an anthropomorphic type right like the little

703
00:24:02,826 --> 00:24:04,715
toaster i was thinking beauty and the

704
00:24:04,715 --> 00:24:06,091
beast and the brave little toaster you

705
00:24:06,091 --> 00:24:07,415
could turn into a real person no

706
00:24:07,415 --> 00:24:09,785
but i wish he did yeah

707
00:24:11,195 --> 00:24:12,665
what if he did i'd like to

708
00:24:12,665 --> 00:24:15,185
shake his head for his bravery i

709
00:24:15,365 --> 00:24:17,555
think there's maybe a few years ago

710
00:24:17,555 --> 00:24:19,265
it was the slowest thing to movie

711
00:24:19,265 --> 00:24:20,435

713
00:24:25,835 --> 00:24:27,605
that's a reference that only we know

714
00:24:27,635 --> 00:24:29,105

00:25:16,865 --> 00:25:18,425
you watch old stuff but it's even

740
00:25:18,455 --> 00:25:20,225
it's gonna get even worse toward like

741
00:25:20,225 --> 00:25:20,975
how fast

742
00:25:21,305 --> 00:25:22,805
our sitcoms gonna be in the future

743
00:25:22,835 --> 00:25:24,995
here's what's weird though i'm i'm rewatching

744
00:25:25,295 --> 00:25:27,065
episodes of star trek the next generation

745
00:25:27,065 --> 00:25:29,315
because i did a podcast where the

746
00:25:29,345 --> 00:25:30,635
you know it's about rewatching that show

747
00:25:30,635 --> 00:25:32,015
and i hadn't seen any in years

748
00:25:32,435 --> 00:25:33,635
and so i watched an episode from

749
00:25:33,635 --> 00:25:35,915
the first season and it was too

750
00:25:36,215 --> 00:25:37,685
bad it was it was it was

751
00:25:37,685 --> 00:25:39,485
a particularly bad episode of the show

752
00:25:39,515 --> 00:25:40,565
yeah but then i was like i

753
00:25:40,565 --> 00:25:41,195
really liked the show

754
00:25:41,195 --> 00:25:42,155
oh so i started just kind of

755
00:25:42,155 --> 00:25:43,955
skipping around episodes that i remembered and

756
00:25:43,985 --> 00:25:46,295
and watching them again and it it

757
00:25:46,295 --> 00:25:47,585
holds up pretty well but there are

758
00:25:47,585 --> 00:25:50,765
certain episodes where they have these gigantic

759
00:25:50,765 --> 00:25:52,955
ideas and they're trying to get to

760
00:25:52,955 --> 00:25:55,025
them so quickly and it's like you

761
00:25:55,055 --> 00:25:57,155
needed more time to talk about this

762
00:25:57,155 --> 00:26:00,575
there there's one where ah scotty from

763
00:26:00,575 --> 00:26:01,355
the original show

764
00:26:01,355 --> 00:26:04,295
yo james do james doohan me up

765
00:26:04,625 --> 00:26:06,515

767
00:26:09,485 --> 00:26:12,455
he he goes through some wormhole or

768
00:26:12,455 --> 00:26:14,225
something being pretty good by the way

769
00:26:14,495 --> 00:26:17,675
i noticed oh no me beam is

770
00:26:17,675 --> 00:26:19,085
not bad we're gonna have to discuss

771
00:26:19,085 --> 00:26:20,795
too by the way we're gonna powers

772
00:26:20,795 --> 00:26:21,785
the three of us are going to

773
00:26:21,995 --> 00:26:23,705
hear these suggestions later on in the

774
00:26:23,705 --> 00:26:24,965
show and we're gonna talk about what

775
00:26:24,965 --> 00:26:26,551
our favorites i guess then perhaps title

776
00:26:26,558 --> 00:26:28,895
the show that's yes so he ends

777
00:26:28,895 --> 00:26:29,195
up on

778
00:26:29,225 --> 00:26:31,745
the the present day enterprise is like

779
00:26:31,925 --> 00:26:33,485
hundreds of years in the future now

780
00:26:33,995 --> 00:26:35,743
and they're like wow this is amazing

781
00:26:35,765 --> 00:26:37,175

782
00:26:37,205 --> 00:26:38,795

783
00:26:38,795 --> 00:26:41,645

784
00:26:42,905 --> 00:26:44,735
oh is it off day for us

785
00:26:44,735 --> 00:26:45,695
we're allowed to wear this so they

786
00:26:45,695 --> 00:26:48,725
spend like the barest amount of time

787
00:26:48,725 --> 00:26:52,025
being amazed that this person from not

788
00:26:52,025 --> 00:26:55,205
just their history but like and noted

789
00:26:55,445 --> 00:26:57,305
hit what would today be a notable

790
00:26:57,305 --> 00:26:59,345
historical figure that would be like well

791
00:26:59,362 --> 00:27:00,665
like if general lee came

792
00:27:02,825 --> 00:27:04,295
not maybe not for everybody

793
00:27:05,615 --> 00:27:07,655
so they they spend like a minute

794
00:27:07,655 --> 00:27:09,395
on that like ah this is amazing

795
00:27:09,395 --> 00:27:11,855

like a

816
00:27:55,115 --> 00:27:57,935
puristic style director and bay the sickbay

817
00:27:57,935 --> 00:27:59,525
isn't well that any any ship has

818
00:27:59,525 --> 00:28:01,865
sickbay what do you mean it's it's

819
00:28:01,865 --> 00:28:03,095
like the doctor's office

820
00:28:04,895 --> 00:28:06,755
it's like the principal's office but for

821
00:28:06,755 --> 00:28:09,035
doctors any ship has sickbay that was

822
00:28:09,035 --> 00:28:11,015
like a fake sentence it is true

823
00:28:11,075 --> 00:28:12,671
that any ship has sickbay doesn't have

824
00:28:12,719 --> 00:28:15,755
nothing any millage not a bad title

825
00:28:15,785 --> 00:28:17,855
sick bay so anyway

826
00:28:19,055 --> 00:28:20,885
they the rest of the episode is

827
00:28:20,885 --> 00:28:24,305
him feeling like he's an old useless

828
00:28:24,305 --> 00:28:26,015
man because he can't help on the

829
00:28:26,015 --> 00:28:27,995
new enterprise and everyone is rude to

830
00:28:27,995 --> 00:28:30,605
him people like ah yeah could you

831
00:28:30,635 --> 00:28:31,775
do you mind we're trying to do

832
00:28:31,775 --> 00:28:33,425
something here it's nice to meet you

833
00:28:33,425 --> 00:28:35,585
please get the fuck out of his

834
00:28:35,585 --> 00:28:38,225
sciences old yeah yeah yeah ok he

835
00:28:38,225 --> 00:28:39,035
wants to tell stories

836
00:28:39,035 --> 00:28:41,076
is everything so then the the birthday

837
00:28:41,076 --> 00:28:42,005
and are they in the middle of

838
00:28:42,005 --> 00:28:44,375
it like an emergency situation yes then

839
00:28:44,375 --> 00:28:46,325
he shouldn't be telling stories no he

840
00:28:46,325 --> 00:28:47,735
shouldn't be that's the thing is that

841
00:28:47,735 --> 00:28:50,435
the plot of this episode becomes how

842
00:28:50,435 --> 00:28:51,875
sad it is that we don't value

843
00:28:51,875 --> 00:28:53,435
our old people and how old people

844
00:28:53,435 --> 00:28:54,875
feel you know out of the way

845
00:28:54,875 --> 00:28:56,495
but it's like maybe you shouldn't just

846
00:28:56,495 --> 00:28:57,935
had a generic old person on the

847
00:28:57,935 --> 00:28:59,195
show and not like a

848
00:28:59,195 --> 00:29:01,443
a famous person from a couple of

849
00:29:01,443 --> 00:29:03,245
centuries in the past that's all like

850
00:29:03,245 --> 00:29:05,195
that studio sixty episode where the old

851
00:29:05,195 --> 00:29:08,495
writers come back to the studio it's

852
00:29:08,495 --> 00:29:09,815
actually because it turns out they're a

853
00:29:09,815 --> 00:29:12,005
great race the new people that suck

854
00:29:12,035 --> 00:29:14,555
right yeah right yeah um look to

855
00:29:14,555 --> 00:29:15,785
tell you oh why don't we take

856
00:29:15,785 --> 00:29:17,345
a break because we want us to

857
00:29:17,345 --> 00:29:18,925
be short we want this to be

858
00:29:18,935 --> 00:29:19,205
real

859
00:29:19,355 --> 00:29:20,615
relatively short show we don't want to

860
00:29:20,615 --> 00:29:22,595
do these longings we want to derail

861
00:29:22,595 --> 00:29:24,725
one story per segment wait a matter

862
00:29:24,725 --> 00:29:26,555
you were used to i was dumb

863
00:29:27,395 --> 00:29:28,535
oh my god did you do you

864
00:29:28,535 --> 00:29:29,795
feel like you needed more time to

865
00:29:29,795 --> 00:29:31,295
tell that story was like the writers

866
00:29:31,325 --> 00:29:32,585
know i didn't need more time i

867
00:29:32,585 --> 00:29:33,875
was given too much time as a

868
00:29:33,875 --> 00:29:35,825
result of all the detours yeah it

869
00:29:35,825 --> 00:29:36,965
was a very it was not even

870
00:29:36,965 --> 00:29:39,245

00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:45,335
before we go to break yeah my

873
00:29:45,335 --> 00:29:47,285
panic about moments like that is oh

874
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:49,715
no this has no payoff this is

875
00:29:49,715 --> 00:29:51,305
just an observation i know okay wait

876
00:29:51,335 --> 00:29:52,835
this has no pay off and now

877

hello everyone this episode has been triggered

909
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:06,400
by b m w zo i when

910
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,840
i was little when i was like

911
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:10,330
fifth grade we would roller blade my

912
00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:11,620
friends and i or my brother and

913
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:13,721
i would roller blade to this candy

914
00:31:13,721 --> 00:31:15,280
shit while it was never your brother

915
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:17,470
and your friends um no always separate

916
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:19,330
but i probably mostly went there with

917
00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:20,710
my friend and we both would

918
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:22,330
roller blade there and it was this

919
00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:24,190
deli that was really a sandwich shop

920
00:31:24,190 --> 00:31:25,810
but it was the height oh no

921
00:31:25,810 --> 00:31:27,730
that's right but yeah so it was

many times my childhood hell junior ah

944
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:10,540
worked there and he was this kind

945
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:12,790
of buttoned-up sort of guy with like

946
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:14,380
you sort of like he had on

947
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:16,480
a apron over his button-down you mind

948
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:18,340

949
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:20,320
some glasses i might be making them

950
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,160
into more of a

951
00:32:21,490 --> 00:32:25,150
ah coin dexter sure cara thought he

952
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:26,110
would have to go pick out all

953
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:27,490
our candies and we'd have like it'd

954
00:32:27,490 --> 00:32:28,915
be it's probably annoying for him because

955
00:32:28,930 --> 00:32:30,460
we'd stand there and be like i

956
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:33,820
want one six slits and i want

957
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:35,950
you know one you'd mix it up

958
00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:37,210
and he would charge by the pound

959
00:32:37,210 --> 00:32:38,080
but you would say no they were

960
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,210
just little individually priced packets like just

961
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:41,380
like god bulk candy

962
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,060
and then i ain't to me to

963
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:45,850
get shock tarts he would say i'm

964
00:32:45,850 --> 00:32:48,550
shocked but he had no expression and

965
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:50,590
he never had any fun as far

966
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:52,300
as i could tell but that was

967
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:54,246
his joke and so we always would

968
00:32:54,246 --> 00:32:55,900
quote him and then when you said

969
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:57,730
that i thought wait was he quoting

970
00:32:57,730 --> 00:32:59,710
something and that was funny to him

971
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:01,240
but then no you were just quoting

972
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:01,540
me

973
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:02,706
i was just quoting here and i'd

974
00:33:02,706 --> 00:33:04,360
probably said like him because yeah you

975
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:08,320
said oh so is this the only

976
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,480
time that al junior did a bit

977
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:11,710
was if you are the shock i'd

978
00:33:11,710 --> 00:33:14,320
see only thing that he ever said

979
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:17,290
every time i'm shocked i remember the

980
00:33:17,290 --> 00:33:20,290
first time that i ever ah figured

981
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:21,640
out that delhi's would make you

982
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:23,680
sandwiches and they were good sandwiches to

983
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:25,300
figured it out like i mean yes

984
00:33:25,302 --> 00:33:27,070
i was seven i think i'm seventeen

985
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:29,440
years old and you know oh just

986
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,600
like any regular deli yeah yeah well

987
00:33:31,630 --> 00:33:33,670
you know i i grown up and

988
00:33:33,670 --> 00:33:35,650
my my mom had made my lunch

989
00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:37,300
and made sandwiches and they are always

990
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:38,621
the same the way she made them

991
00:33:38,621 --> 00:33:39,610
in my mom you know we make

992
00:33:39,610 --> 00:33:41,110
saw other people eating sandwiches you're like

993
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:41,860
my mom made that

994
00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:44,170
yeah i figured you know but i

995
00:33:44,170 --> 00:33:46,030
never needed at home yeah i think

996
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:47,260
you had to go to a restaurant

997
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:48,880
or something to buy a sandwich done

998
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,260
some other way other than making it

999
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:52,150
at home and so i remember my

1000
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:53,950

that we were gonna do is we're

00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:20,350
just going to talk about things that

1041
00:35:20,350 --> 00:35:21,760
happen to us of course and things

1042
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:22,930
from our past and things from our

1043
00:35:22,930 --> 00:35:24,760

1044
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:27,400
what are my dreams i've feel like

1045
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,540
i'm gonna be in a grave my

1046
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:30,520
name will be on it are you

1047
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:31,060
going to be creative

1048
00:35:31,270 --> 00:35:32,530
or yeah that's a good question i

1049
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:34,600
don't know i think about it a

1050
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,010
lot i want to be cremated i

1051
00:35:36,010 --> 00:35:37,870
want to say i'm the oldest okay

1052
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:38,860
i just want to say i think

1053
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:39,850
about it too but i've said it

1054
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:42,190
i've said it for twenty years i

1055
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:44,260
want to be cremated i think graveyards

1056
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:46,930
are weird i actually want to be

1057
00:35:46,930 --> 00:35:49,810
in a casket so that everyone could

1058
00:35:49,810 --> 00:35:51,070
come in look at me

1059
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:52,690
like you're sure

1060
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:55,660
more love but i think as i've

1061
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:57,640
gotten older i'm more comfortable the idea

1062
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:00,400
of cremation because it's ah kind of

1063
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,440
pointless to keep making things i just

1064
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:04,750
go underground yeah yeah i used to

1065
00:36:04,750 --> 00:36:06,550
think i wanted to be buried and

1066
00:36:06,550 --> 00:36:09,790
then after my parents died and i

1067
00:36:09,790 --> 00:36:12,430
never went to visit either of their

1068
00:36:12,430 --> 00:36:13,900
graves and i realised like

1069
00:36:14,148 --> 00:36:15,460
the grave like as they were being

1070
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:17,140
buried like i'm never coming back here

1071
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,360
really well yeah because i didn't feel

1072
00:36:19,450 --> 00:36:21,400
where where are they in third oh

1073
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:22,540
yeah i didn't feel a sense of

1074
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:24,100
connection to that spot you like i

1075
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:25,270
know that they were gone and you

1076
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:26,950
still have like a plaque or something

1077
00:36:26,950 --> 00:36:28,930
yeah if you work remains cremated or

1078
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,670
a bench here's it's weird my dad

1079
00:36:30,670 --> 00:36:33,100
was cremated and he was buried next

1080
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:34,180
to my mother wow

1081
00:36:34,210 --> 00:36:35,890
his ashes were put in in an

1082
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:37,300
urn and then a box and then

1083
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:39,280
buried wait a box like a coffin

1084
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,072
sized box or just a no no

1085
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:43,570
just a box okay a tasteful box

1086
00:36:43,690 --> 00:36:46,000
but he's taking up a coffin shaped

1087
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,860
space well pretty much you can't stick

1088
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:49,540
anybody else knows that's the weird part

1089
00:36:49,570 --> 00:36:51,070
you know like we're just gonna run

1090
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:52,540
out of space on this are definitely

1091
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:54,340
well actually every time i

1092
00:36:54,610 --> 00:36:56,200
drive into new york from the airport

1093
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:58,450
there's that really big cemetery you know

1094
00:36:58,450 --> 00:36:59,590
i'm talking to yeah where you see

1095
00:36:59,590 --> 00:37:01,240
the skyline right behind it and it

1096
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:03,220
just makes life seem so stupid like

1097
00:37:03,370 --> 00:37:04,780
you just see like all of these

1098
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:07,387
these tombstones and then there's like hey

1099
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:09,940
guys someone like they're all going into

1100
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:11,980
that i hate that stretched so much

1101
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:13,780
it's so weird it is real but

1102
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:14,500
every time i see it

1103
00:37:14,530 --> 00:37:17,770
i'm like wow everything so pointless yeah

1104
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:18,850
well that's what this show is going

1105
00:37:18,850 --> 00:37:21,130
to be about the pointlessness of anyway

1106
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:23,169
catch-all rod crash who was already beat

1107
00:37:23,169 --> 00:37:24,310
home but hbo

1108
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:28,720
i like how pointless things are in

1109
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:29,770
my mouth i mean i kind of

1110
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,060
that's kind of my whole approach to

1111
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:32,140
life i feel that way about

1112
00:37:33,490 --> 00:37:34,840
i feel that way about the ocean

1113
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:36,460
like the the idea of the ocean

1114
00:37:36,850 --> 00:37:38,800
making you feel small or space making

1115
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,480
feel small i actually find that comforting

1116
00:37:40,669 --> 00:37:42,280
yeah it's that i'm just like a

1117
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:44,200
tiny speck and oh that's interesting yeah

1118
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:45,970
yeah sure like a dog that kind

1119
00:37:45,970 --> 00:37:47,860
of takes pressure off already likes it's

1120
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:49,600
crate it likes to be talking love

1121
00:37:49,603 --> 00:37:51,520
that's great you should i'm gonna send

1122
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,720
you this video and everyone can go

1123
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:53,230
google it

1124
00:37:53,470 --> 00:37:56,620
it's called optimistic nihilism and on youtube

1125
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:58,210
and it's this whole little thing that

1126
00:37:58,210 --> 00:38:00,760
kind of like expresses that idea in

1127
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:01,750
a way that i really like in

1128
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:03,460
a way that's and how is it

1129
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:05,560
comforting though to know that nothing you

1130
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:08,320
do will ever matter because that's it's

1131
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:10,540
comforting it's comforting to know that that's

1132
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:11,920
just the deal do you know what

1133
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,312
i mean it's the same for

1134
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:15,190
yeah he's made with the universe we

1135
00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:16,900
all just happen to be here and

1136
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:19,600
it's you know we're all going through

1137
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,370
the same stuff we're all we're all

1138
00:38:21,370 --> 00:38:23,620
having these feelings and right it's it's

1139
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:25,540
very i feel like it connects me

1140
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:27,100
more to the world than it makes

1141
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:29,860
me feel um like a minuscule partisan

1142
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:32,140
what is the point of everything yeah

1143
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:35,440
fuck define no do it well is

1144
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,460
it the effect that you have on

1145
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:38,290
other people is it the i mean

1146
00:38:38,290 --> 00:38:40,090
that's yeah i think so to some

1147
00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:41,950
extent i mean that's why i like

1148
00:38:41,950 --> 00:38:43,840
doing podcasts and stuff even though it

1149
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:46,420
can feel like it's pointless sometimes because

1150
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:47,980
like why why are we doing one

1151
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,390
but the idea that you could make

1152
00:38:49,390 --> 00:38:51,070
someone's day better is nice because there's

1153
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:52,420
no point anything so if you're gonna

1154
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:53,380
be sad and feel bad

1155
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:54,430
it made me laugh a little bit

1156
00:38:54,430 --> 00:38:56,320
and then it's not just entertainers who

1157
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,460
do that so it's not just yeah

1158
00:38:57,490 --> 00:38:59,170
trainers whose lives are worthwhile

1159
00:39:00,850 --> 00:39:02,740
i mean i like anyone anyone can

1160
00:39:02,770 --> 00:39:04,690
do that for other people and it's

1161
00:39:04,690 --> 00:39:05,980
yeah it's not just when we're doing

1162
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:07,300
cornelia yeah i meant like why do

1163
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:09,400
i choose the specific activity remember what

1164
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:11,620
is meaningful but of course everyone's life

1165
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:12,880
is meaningful and that's also the point

1166
00:39:13,330 --> 00:39:15,160
right all lives matter i understand yeah

1167
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:16,000
that's what i've been trying to say

1168
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,940
for years and i'm wearing shirts that

1169
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:20,394
says ah

1170
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:24,430
so understand what's happening in our world

1171
00:39:24,430 --> 00:39:25,570
right now though because it seems like

1172
00:39:25,570 --> 00:39:27,820
everyone's just doing horrible things for no

1173
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:29,560
reason yeah we're all gonna die why

1174
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:30,640
do you take away everyone's health care

1175
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:31,210
why do you have to make it

1176
00:39:31,210 --> 00:39:32,650
so women can't have abortions i don't

1177
00:39:32,650 --> 00:39:34,630

1178
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:37,870
money because money everyone everyone wants more

1179
00:39:37,870 --> 00:39:40,510

00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,210
spelling or their families out there but

1187
00:39:49,210 --> 00:39:50,380
i was thinking about like all the

1188
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:53,890
money that he made right and supposedly

1189
00:39:53,890 --> 00:39:55,720
he doesn't give it to tori spelling

1190
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:57,040
like tori spelling didn't get any of

1191
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:59,230
it right yeah wow i know that's

1192
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:00,670
nest or maybe she gets like a

1193
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:01,060

00:43:28,715 --> 00:43:30,365
sense of almost every word i said

1301
00:43:30,365 --> 00:43:30,725
wrong

1302
00:43:32,615 --> 00:43:34,415

1303
00:43:34,415 --> 00:43:37,235
true almost everyone this it's a real

1304
00:43:37,235 --> 00:43:40,565
hat-trick um we'd would you know it's

1305
00:43:40,565 --> 00:43:41,945
like secret santa you pick a name

1306
00:43:41,945 --> 00:43:42,755
and then you had to buy that

1307
00:43:42,755 --> 00:43:45,128
person a gift um so what

1308
00:43:47,015 --> 00:43:48,125
think where we had to buy each

1309
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:50,465
other's families goodness oh that's i would

1310
00:43:50,465 --> 00:43:52,647
love that people we don't know i

1311
00:43:52,805 --> 00:43:54,305
try and it's just as hard as

1312
00:43:54,305 --> 00:43:55,865
buying something for someone you know yeah

1313
00:43:55,955 --> 00:43:57,395
yeah woo yeah because here i would

1314
00:43:57,395 --> 00:43:58,835
just know the general facts about them

1315
00:43:58,835 --> 00:44:00,065
and you'd be like what's something fun

1316
00:44:00,065 --> 00:44:01,205
they might like and that would be

1317
00:44:01,205 --> 00:44:02,885
easier than being like i know everything

1318
00:44:02,885 --> 00:44:04,055
about them they're going to have this

1319
00:44:04,055 --> 00:44:06,305
reaction that i honestly the people who

1320
00:44:06,515 --> 00:44:09,215
listen to conversations throughout the throughout the

1321
00:44:09,215 --> 00:44:11,825
year with people and their family and

1322
00:44:11,825 --> 00:44:13,265

first name is dorothea my name is

some sort of like disconnection

1432
00:47:50,435 --> 00:47:52,835
from all of that if you decide

1433
00:47:52,835 --> 00:47:54,365
not to be called dorothea or i

1434
00:47:54,365 --> 00:47:55,715
was never called that is just my

1435
00:47:55,715 --> 00:47:57,335
rice that was really weird about my

1436
00:47:57,335 --> 00:48:00,155
brother to his he was ah bert

1437
00:48:01,055 --> 00:48:02,735
was a junior bert well he wasn't

1438
00:48:02,735 --> 00:48:04,085
even virginia because to be a junior

1439
00:48:04,085 --> 00:48:05,375
you have to have the exact same

1440
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:07,265
middle name o rye or like george

1441
00:48:07,265 --> 00:48:10,265
w bush yes yeah exactly so ah

1442
00:48:10,325 --> 00:48:10,565
but

1443
00:48:10,925 --> 00:48:12,305
but i from what i know he

1444
00:48:12,305 --> 00:48:14,375
was older ah no one ever called

1445
00:48:14,375 --> 00:48:15,335
him bird they just called him by

1446
00:48:15,335 --> 00:48:16,865
his middle name greg i guess to

1447
00:48:17,135 --> 00:48:19,325
differentiate right yeah that wouldn't be the

1448
00:48:19,325 --> 00:48:20,615
same thing as you yeah but that

1449
00:48:20,645 --> 00:48:22,085
is something i feel like happens people

1450
00:48:22,295 --> 00:48:23,735
like passed on the name then don't

1451
00:48:23,735 --> 00:48:25,475
call them the name right that's an

1452
00:48:25,475 --> 00:48:27,845
interest as years pass down yeah yeah

1453
00:48:27,905 --> 00:48:30,155
my great grandma is dorothy

1454
00:48:30,755 --> 00:48:33,215
um then why why the twist greek

00:48:33,215 --> 00:48:35,465
version i mean did you know her

1456
00:48:35,465 --> 00:48:36,755
at all or no no she was

1457
00:48:36,755 --> 00:48:39,305
dead before your yeah i sounded harsh

1458
00:48:39,305 --> 00:48:40,895
the ways i knew my great grandpa

1459
00:48:40,895 --> 00:48:42,365

talking about though i like it

1696
00:57:48,210 --> 00:57:49,620

1698
00:57:55,950 --> 00:57:56,730
i don't i still know what it

1699
00:57:56,730 --> 00:57:58,380
means is it a room is an

1700
00:57:58,380 --> 00:58:00,240
area's roots like the medical facilities on

1701
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:01,560
a ship okay you did tell me

1702
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:02,203
that i just didn't hear

1703
00:58:03,810 --> 00:58:07,260
didn't retain ah i've done okay this

1704
00:58:07,260 --> 00:58:08,580
is five generally

1705
00:58:09,990 --> 00:58:11,220
that just gives the idea that we're

1706
00:58:11,610 --> 00:58:13,260
never going to talk about gender issues

1707
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:16,410
thing which we never will however never

1708
00:58:16,410 --> 00:58:19,170
i don't know talk about um where

1709
00:58:19,170 --> 00:58:21,570
did we leave off generally i know

1710
00:58:21,570 --> 00:58:24,420
but it can um delete i'm shocked

1711
00:58:25,110 --> 00:58:29,310
i'm shocked too generic i feel this

1712
00:58:29,310 --> 00:58:29,940
has now

1713
00:58:29,940 --> 00:58:32,730
no pay off i mean so far

1714
00:58:32,730 --> 00:58:35,400
honestly i love that one pretty good

1715
00:58:36,060 --> 00:58:38,130
um or just no pay off is

1716
00:58:38,130 --> 00:58:39,660
another option i think this has no

1717
00:58:39,660 --> 00:58:41,250
pay off sounds more like a title

1718
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:44,700

00:58:44,700 --> 00:58:46,320

01:02:44,855 --> 01:02:46,175
and they don't care they don't care

1824
01:02:46,175 --> 01:02:48,605
i guess ya know what they said

1825
01:02:48,605 --> 01:02:50,315
but it was cleared up so everyone

1826
01:02:50,316 --> 01:02:51,545
stopped telling me that okay

1827
01:02:53,285 --> 01:02:54,395
do you know there's another race by

1828
01:02:54,395 --> 01:02:56,135
tv okay you know

1829
01:02:58,085 --> 01:03:00,485
okay so your turn were between these

1830
01:03:00,485 --> 01:03:02,795
two this has no pay off okay

1831
01:03:03,545 --> 01:03:05,195
and haha have to go

1832
01:03:06,815 --> 01:03:08,105
i still think this has no pay

1833
01:03:08,105 --> 01:03:10,295
off as it's very clear i like

1834
01:03:10,295 --> 01:03:12,695
that one here's my reservation about it

1835
01:03:13,115 --> 01:03:14,945
is i feel like it's

1836
01:03:16,535 --> 01:03:19,265
so deprecating it's too sets that's true

1837
01:03:19,265 --> 01:03:20,405
because it does have a path it's

1838
01:03:20,405 --> 01:03:23,645
fun it's fun what about also what

1839
01:03:23,645 --> 01:03:25,025
podcast has a pay off what about

1840
01:03:25,025 --> 01:03:26,345
the ultimate pay off

1841
01:03:27,605 --> 01:03:29,525
i like the ultimate pillow i would

1842
01:03:29,525 --> 01:03:32,525
rather make a gigantic promise yeah until

1843
01:03:32,525 --> 01:03:34,925
people this is worth listening yeah the

1844
01:03:34,925 --> 01:03:38,555
ultimate payoff your ultimate that's good i

1845
01:03:38,555 --> 01:03:40,325
like the ultimate pay off

1846
01:03:41,825 --> 01:03:43,835
okay i like that it's very confident

1847
01:03:43,895 --> 01:03:45,905
we ultimate pay alright so it might

1848
01:03:45,905 --> 01:03:49,145
be that um and no you know

1849
01:03:49,235 --> 01:03:51,275
because you're listening to it yes ah

1850
01:03:51,275 --> 01:03:52,745
what would be really funny if it's

1851
01:03:52,745 --> 01:03:54,905
none of those which is also possible

1852
01:03:55,295 --> 01:03:57,605

1853
01:03:58,265 --> 01:04:00,065
