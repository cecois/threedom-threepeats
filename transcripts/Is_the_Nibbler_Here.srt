to structure like ah yes i love

19
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:58,230

00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:09,360
i mean there's no

26
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,170
no other reason

in general bb is a civil whoa

30
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:20,490
morse code being cool

31
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:25,380
yeah i guess dot dot dash dash

32
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:26,700
dot dot but it makes me think

33
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,590

was first coast no it's not morse

36
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:35,370
code actually at all and i know

37
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:36,750
it's not no but i am thinking

38
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:38,700
about things daring to know thinking about

39
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,500
morse code because i'm trying to think

40
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:41,760
about semaphores because

41
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,941

i try to do oh absolutely but

46
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:55,620
what so flag flag language like a

47
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:58,380
few you're holding my flags like language

48
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:00,960
and they do ah it's leaps depending

49
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:01,920
on how you boo

50
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:04,350
it's for naval stuff yeah you can

51
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:07,020
communicate to another ship to ship yeah

52
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:08,250
it's a lot of good twenty as

53
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:10,860
honestly you're really good aliens i feel

54
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:13,919
like being over here ah you're forcing

55
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,270
me to only look at you oh

56
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:17,940

forcing me to lay lord you huh

59
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,900
road morse code is like i think

60
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,460
probably the hardest language to learn of

61
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:31,530
all the languages ok it's like two

62
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,309
dot dot dash it's like there's no

63
00:02:33,309 --> 00:02:35,490
vary because i i'm a person and

the rehearsal process vividly i remember everything

155
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,450
about it other than the content of

156
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:38,400
the play which i guess tells you

157
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,990
a little bit about my acting process

158
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:41,760
you remember about the rehearsal process if

159
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:42,720
not the content

160
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,030
just like hanging out with low initial

161
00:05:46,143 --> 00:05:48,510
going to going to the theater during

162
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:51,180
your legwarmers yeah doing my stretches looking

163
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:52,260
in the mirror saying it's time

164

165
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,650
well we had a topic that we

166
00:05:58,650 --> 00:05:59,400
are going to bring up on the

167
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:03,240
show this is lawrence topics no whoa

168
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,190
a topic later they'll be lawrence topics

169
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:08,520
yeah it's really good um wow so

170
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,230
that's actually it's actually more of a

171
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:11,790
question for my topic so it's not

172
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:12,960
really a topic it's more of a

173
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:13,410
it's not

174
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,760
topics so it's not it's not long

175
00:06:14,778 --> 00:06:16,440
topic although i guess you could this

176
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,510
is the odd raise a topic this

177
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:19,710
is the opposite of i usually goes

178
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:21,390
usually people have more of a comment

179
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:22,890
than a question yeah it's more of

180
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:24,060
a question than a comment and i

181
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:26,820
just ask you you lent that dvd

182
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:29,280

197
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:53,340
be a great reveal but i did

198
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:55,500

00:06:58,380 --> 00:06:59,940
my yakking yeah yeah because i had

201
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:01,140
so many cds i wasn't sure yeah

202
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,840
oh yeah yeah sure but wait warren

203
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,820
tearing the the question was because you're

204
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:06,930
tearing that i was trying to do

205
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:10,830
gc ah intro from the life and

206
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:13,465
times of sean carter volume three anyway

207
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,880
oh hell no we won't very well

208
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,400
um i just wanted to ask because

209
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,380
you walked in two minutes late maybe

210
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:22,320
three five is totally fine yeah but

211
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:23,730
paul is here before you and i

212
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:26,055
was actually really thrown because usually you

213
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:27,120
are variously thrilled

214
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:29,820
sure that was great too but usually

215
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:30,720
i'm here and we have to do

216
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,800
small talk but your here ah we're

217
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,150
forced to do that's how you think

218
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:37,440
of it as that's how you think

219
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,240
of it but i'm saying you think

220
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,280
that's how you put them so i

221
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,990
think that's how you'll think of it

222
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,550
but i'm trying to say is it's

223
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:45,870
it was very unusual not to you

224
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:47,280
first as

225
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:48,720
and i asked paul and then he

226
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,160
said well now scott has a baby

227
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,390
so there's gonna be more chance you'll

228
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:54,600
be late well was it the baby

229
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,770
or did i just leave late i

230
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:57,000
don't know and then that's my question

231
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,410
that's paul said i don't have a

232
00:07:58,410 --> 00:07:59,670
baby but i'm always late and i

233
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:01,290
said that's just part of your nature

234
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:03,960
and he said it's not good and

235
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,100
i said it's fine you know what's

236
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:07,440
not and then i was curious

237
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,870
what makes you late and i wanna

238
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:11,100
hear what made julie and i wanna

239
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:12,330
hear what tends to make you late

240
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:15,720
alright what i will get wrapped up

241
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:19,440
in little fucking projects in my home

242
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:22,560
such as fixing something or like fixing

243
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,150
something that will make an extortionist thing

244
00:08:24,157 --> 00:08:27,420
something putting essential house yeah ah making

245
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:27,600
a hell

246
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,097
the copter yeah um yeah right into

247
00:08:30,097 --> 00:08:32,190
it's little it's little projects that i

248
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:35,220
get fixated on and then it's too

249
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:40,260
late yeah right and i wonder sometimes

250
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:41,430
not to be one of those people

251
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:42,780
but i wonder sometimes if i do

252
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:45,870
have some sort of h d i'm

253
00:08:45,873 --> 00:08:47,670
thinking i have that i've never

254
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,851
i've never ah like tried to get

255
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:51,510
diagnosed or anything and i don't i'm

256
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:52,740
not going to say oh i have

257
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,630
it was that let me diagnosing sure

258
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:56,190
god you're a total piece of shit

259
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,476
medical it pills

260
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,720
i am paying bills um so ah

261
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:07,110
yeah i i i noticed that

262
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:09,750
i will be doing in the middle

263
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:12,120
of doing something and then i think

264
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:13,950
of another thing like i passed by

265
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:15,600
something that i need to do and

266
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,860
i'm like i also need to do

267
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:18,600
that and then i'll be like no

268
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,240
do this you can't do both of

269
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,440
these at the same time see mike

270
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,970
and i just had this conversation because

271
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,610
i asked him because i had heard

272
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:28,200
on another podcast okay so i'm elizabeth

273
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:28,320
lee

274
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,040
sam's podcast her husband andy was diagnosed

275
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,320
with the i believe abt yes so

276
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,400
i can do that's right it was

277
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,680
a whole thing were he was talking

278
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,000
about some things and i think some

279
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,680
listeners were suggesting some things and he

280
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,240
took an actual test and knew nothing

281
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:44,790
and then he's now feeling much better

282
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:47,580
because he's dealing with it yeah and

283
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:48,480
then one of the things

284
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:49,440
i think it might have been said

285
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,630
on that podcast was leaving cabinets open

286
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:53,040
and then there were having it open

287
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:54,750
for the you're supposed to do that

288
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,186
yeah that's something all your cabinets

289
00:09:58,918 --> 00:09:59,670
poltergeist therapy

290
00:10:01,423 --> 00:10:02,875
there is a cabinet like cabinets are

291
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:04,135
being launched over a couple times within

292
00:10:04,135 --> 00:10:05,245
a couple days and i said to

293
00:10:05,245 --> 00:10:07,615
my dvd i heard that this is

294
00:10:07,615 --> 00:10:09,415
a thing because he was leaving kevin

295
00:10:09,415 --> 00:10:11,095
yeah open but now i like to

296
00:10:11,695 --> 00:10:14,275
be female been fucking concentration never knew

297
00:10:14,275 --> 00:10:16,285
this and she's like me every time

298
00:10:16,285 --> 00:10:17,905
i have what openings like dvd and

299
00:10:17,905 --> 00:10:19,195
i'm like you just stop asking me

300
00:10:19,195 --> 00:10:21,205
that because i didn't mean

301
00:10:22,255 --> 00:10:24,385
but now i kind of do because

302
00:10:24,385 --> 00:10:26,731
i get really fluttery one thing too

303
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:28,135
that i wanna like because i'm not

304
00:10:28,135 --> 00:10:29,905
a computer you do come to basically

305
00:10:29,905 --> 00:10:31,705
you're doing something in a cabinet you

306
00:10:31,705 --> 00:10:33,355
get distracted you leave it open yeah

307
00:10:33,385 --> 00:10:35,215
go to something else yeah theory okay

308
00:10:35,215 --> 00:10:36,625
and then i'm like oh my computer

309
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:37,345
and i have a tie of a

310
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:38,935
thousand tabs open and then i'm doing

311
00:10:38,935 --> 00:10:40,795
something then i switched something else and

312
00:10:40,795 --> 00:10:41,695
then like four hours later

313
00:10:41,725 --> 00:10:42,715
i go back to the tablet oh

314
00:10:42,715 --> 00:10:43,735
yeah i was gonna sign up for

315
00:10:43,735 --> 00:10:45,265
that thing i have no memory of

316
00:10:45,265 --> 00:10:47,575
it i mind thing is a combination

317
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:50,005
of your only fans yeah i gonna

318
00:10:51,535 --> 00:10:52,885
only fi fan

319
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:56,185
here's my thing i think it is

320
00:10:56,185 --> 00:10:57,685
a combo of the getting fixated on

321
00:10:57,685 --> 00:10:59,005
things which may or may not be

322
00:10:59,065 --> 00:11:02,635
eighty h tunnels also part of that

323
00:11:02,635 --> 00:11:05,785
is procrastination on things i should be

324
00:11:05,785 --> 00:11:09,955
doing yeah for no reason whatever reason

325
00:11:09,955 --> 00:11:11,815
where it's like you know you have

326
00:11:11,815 --> 00:11:12,925
to do this thing you have to

327
00:11:12,925 --> 00:11:14,095
send these emails you have to contact

328
00:11:14,095 --> 00:11:16,945
these people whatever it's organizers saying and

329
00:11:16,945 --> 00:11:19,525
i'm like yes i know but i'm

330
00:11:19,525 --> 00:11:21,175
going through this other thing that is

331
00:11:21,175 --> 00:11:24,415
of not pressing orders at all yeah

332
00:11:24,445 --> 00:11:26,845
all right but here's one other question

333
00:11:26,845 --> 00:11:28,645
do you feel like the eighty first

334
00:11:28,645 --> 00:11:30,295
of all eighty eight is probably becoming

335
00:11:30,295 --> 00:11:31,555
one of those terms like oh cd

336
00:11:31,555 --> 00:11:33,205
where you were saying where weirdly and

337
00:11:33,265 --> 00:11:34,165
we may be saying

338
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:37,195
incorrectly yeah and it may be minimizing

339
00:11:37,435 --> 00:11:38,965
yeah because there are people who act

340
00:11:38,995 --> 00:11:41,515
or like just using it like it's

341
00:11:41,515 --> 00:11:43,315
a word and not like an actual

342
00:11:43,315 --> 00:11:44,275
diagnosis yeah right

343
00:11:44,935 --> 00:11:46,345
but do you think that maybe and

344
00:11:46,345 --> 00:11:47,095
i'm like what am i talking about

345
00:11:48,325 --> 00:11:51,205
just good do you think that anyway

346
00:11:51,205 --> 00:11:53,515
see you later shooting and maybe you

347
00:11:53,515 --> 00:11:57,535
could finish my sentence and computers internet

348
00:11:57,745 --> 00:12:01,009
social media probably lowering our tolerance for

349
00:12:01,015 --> 00:12:03,805
task maybe but it might be also

350
00:12:03,805 --> 00:12:07,315
that that just is a is it

351
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:08,335
an it's just another

352
00:12:08,335 --> 00:12:09,805
other thing to get lost in as

353
00:12:09,805 --> 00:12:11,845
opposed to it being of something or

354
00:12:11,845 --> 00:12:13,705
be whatever yes yes yes yeah or

355
00:12:13,705 --> 00:12:15,625

people i can tell people are thinking

361
00:12:25,015 --> 00:12:26,935
when they walk past yeah lauren to

407
00:14:02,935 --> 00:14:04,855

442
00:15:03,835 --> 00:15:05,876
wet hair like it's always like yeah

443
00:15:05,876 --> 00:15:07,375

446
00:15:10,795 --> 00:15:12,655

00:15:14,755 --> 00:15:17,605
with wet hair yeah because i've instead

449
00:15:17,605 --> 00:15:19,015
of because i feel like it's a

450
00:15:19,015 --> 00:15:21,175
waste of time to be cleaner early

451
00:15:22,465 --> 00:15:25,915
i just feel like i don't prioritize

452
00:15:25,915 --> 00:15:27,925
it until it's like okay now i

453
00:15:27,925 --> 00:15:29,365
have only this amount of time i'll

454
00:15:29,365 --> 00:15:31,195
do that but i'm trying to do

455
00:15:31,195 --> 00:15:32,215
the training a little better and i

456
00:15:32,215 --> 00:15:35,185
think also my acknowledgement of my distress

457
00:15:35,215 --> 00:15:37,855
easily distracted vnus not necessarily a d

458
00:15:37,855 --> 00:15:39,055
d is just that i'm trying to

459
00:15:39,205 --> 00:15:40,739
be more on top of it so

460
00:15:40,739 --> 00:15:42,145
i last night was journaling and i

461
00:15:42,145 --> 00:15:42,415

462
00:15:42,655 --> 00:15:44,275

like they get implants in their face

739
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,820
they get structural tn it was not

740
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:43,610
a feel good show necessarily just really

741
00:24:43,610 --> 00:24:44,960
so it sounds like there's impossible to

742
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,640
feel good but i remember actually this

743
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,490
because i i've i watched as a

744
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:51,800
kid which is also fucked up and

745
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:53,120
i remembered this thing about tea

746
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,110
teeth but now i know that it

747
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:55,640
must be veneers but it always confused

748
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,590
me until more recently i had this

749
00:24:57,590 --> 00:24:59,510
memory of them sort of you putting

750
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:00,680
on baloo laid on the teeth and

751
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:03,680
like moving them into place they just

752
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,090
put veneers out and they just whittled

753
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:07,130
them down to shard yeah and put

754
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:09,140
gauss and that part of it is

755
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:11,270
so scary yeah but anyway it's not

756
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:12,830
attend a little peg it wasn't really

757
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:13,190
a field

758
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:15,560
i know about that process it wasn't

759
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:17,300
it wasn't like a feel good show

760
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:18,830
but then it's such a weird spinoff

761
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:20,570
because they they turned them the home

762
00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:23,000
edition into a big feel good family

763
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,740
show oh yeah we have but it

764
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:26,717
was the same show like no it's

765
00:25:26,810 --> 00:25:29,327
spin over extreme homemaker oh she may

766
00:25:29,327 --> 00:25:31,670
go now extremely media should know because

767
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,290
think they realised it's so toxic like

768
00:25:33,290 --> 00:25:33,440
the

769
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:35,480
the kids and the the dad and

770
00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:37,041
you know whatever like the husband and

771
00:25:37,041 --> 00:25:38,240
the kids or the wife and kids

772
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,460
cousin they'd show up the child see

773
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:42,230
there eventually the reveal and go yeah

774
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:44,720
oh you're beautiful looks so different there

775
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:48,050
was no there was no gradual acceptance

776
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,790
of the change so it's like you're

777
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:51,620
just seeing your mom go away their

778
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,240
bandages for six weeks and they come

779
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:53,600
back

780
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:56,030
but yeah but so the the homeland

781
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:57,620
i read some article about like oh

782
00:25:57,620 --> 00:25:59,240
they do a really shitty job and

783
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:01,790
then they raise the value on the

784
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:03,795
people's homes so much that people can't

785
00:26:03,795 --> 00:26:05,270
pay the taxes on the home and

786
00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:07,910

i sort of get reality shows now

836
00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:08,990
because we have

837
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:12,680
three friends who also watched the show

838
00:28:12,770 --> 00:28:15,110

00:28:15,170 --> 00:28:16,460
yeah so we text each other and

840
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:19,070
stuff like that you feel but here's

841
00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:21,620
the thing is that i because it's

842
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:24,440
all just horse shit when i find

843
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:26,750
myself when i'm watching it even when

844
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:28,820
we're texting each other and i find

845
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:30,200
myself thinking

846
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:32,750
like making a judgment on someone's actions

847
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:34,880
or whatever right like they fucking got

848
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,640
me thinking yeah they tricked you that's

849
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:40,460
what's fun and by the way you

850
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:41,960
do doesn't reach you do it about

851
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,880
scripted shows to like oh my god

852
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:44,660
why would he do that i can't

853
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:46,370
believe you do that baba like it's

854
00:28:46,370 --> 00:28:48,800
like but yeah but i mean but

855
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,480
you're only watching the reality shows

856
00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:53,330
because it's real like the idea was

857
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:55,400
like hey idea being a voyeur on

858
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,680
these idiots yeah but then you would

859
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:00,320
never watch a scripted show featuring these

860
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,150
people on love is blind for instance

861
00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:03,680
so but i think there's some way

862
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,360
you know doing doing the exact same

863
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,460
storylines yeah i mean i don't have

864
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:08,570
to defend it i just like it

865
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,370
this is an interesting idea

866
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:13,156
a reenactment you take lifted you take

867
00:29:13,156 --> 00:29:15,110
a season of a reality show then

868
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:18,530
you have those people reenacted a scripted

869
00:29:18,530 --> 00:29:20,360
version yeah we're like yeah that seems

870
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:22,220
to help and see which is better

871
00:29:23,150 --> 00:29:24,800
see much as i would like and

872
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,864
you do like you know like you

873
00:29:26,930 --> 00:29:28,820
shoot it exactly like a scripted show

874
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:30,590
rather than a reality show yeah

875
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,900
although it's like things like avid elementary

876
00:29:32,990 --> 00:29:34,880
same thing i mean i thought that

877
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,821
was a documentary i really do because

878
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:38,270
i spoke to the camera explaining our

879
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:41,120
feelings were in what's your lowrance topics

880
00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:42,260
it's not really a topic it's a

881
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:43,520
question i think i need a new

882
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:46,430

trying to wrap our mouths around a

974
00:33:03,945 --> 00:33:05,325
foreign what i'm saying the reason that

00:33:05,325 --> 00:33:07,065
we translated that way like we're not

976
00:33:07,065 --> 00:33:07,905
saying napoli

977
00:33:09,135 --> 00:33:13,275
nobody is leaving nobody believed to be

978
00:33:13,575 --> 00:33:15,195
overly bitter

979
00:33:15,315 --> 00:33:17,715
peter crooks oh bobby meets with the

980
00:33:17,715 --> 00:33:18,585
wonder your tombstone

981
00:33:20,355 --> 00:33:22,785
it's just is is commercials for the

982
00:33:22,815 --> 00:33:24,615
english people trying to say this word

983
00:33:24,615 --> 00:33:26,175
that they that they don't have the

984
00:33:26,205 --> 00:33:27,945
ah the tongue sounds for i think

985
00:33:27,945 --> 00:33:30,165
they also in those days i think

986
00:33:30,165 --> 00:33:32,205
they just decided what the name was

987
00:33:32,295 --> 00:33:34,185
as opposed to like they hurting to

988
00:33:34,185 --> 00:33:35,895
say they heard italian people saying and

989
00:33:35,895 --> 00:33:37,905
they go like oh florence yeah that's

990
00:33:37,905 --> 00:33:39,585
probably what they're saying and then they

991
00:33:39,585 --> 00:33:39,795
put

992
00:33:39,855 --> 00:33:43,845
on a map mr charles atlas puts

993
00:33:43,845 --> 00:33:44,685

to do because she was writing so

1238
00:41:43,085 --> 00:41:44,975
what part of what happened before this

1239
00:41:44,975 --> 00:41:46,535
is that this one woman kept trying

1240
00:41:46,535 --> 00:41:47,555
to race ahead of me

1241
00:41:48,185 --> 00:41:49,505
and it was really annoying and so

1242
00:41:49,505 --> 00:41:51,065
i eventually took you're trying to box

1243
00:41:51,065 --> 00:41:52,805
her out with your suitcase so sadly

1244
00:41:52,895 --> 00:41:55,265
it's um this as a smaller escalator

1245
00:41:55,265 --> 00:41:56,765
before this you know and this other

1246
00:41:56,765 --> 00:41:58,385
woman like has to get onto like

1247
00:41:58,385 --> 00:41:59,615
let her go and then i just

1248
00:41:59,615 --> 00:42:01,415
go i'm just going downstairs and then

1249
00:42:01,415 --> 00:42:02,915
instead of doing the stairs i get

onto the escalator and then drop my

1251
00:42:03,995 --> 00:42:05,465

1252
00:42:05,465 --> 00:42:07,205
sally went to a secret hidy hole

1253
00:42:07,205 --> 00:42:08,015

tried to make me feel like shit

1308
00:44:01,175 --> 00:44:02,735
and shook their head like man that's

1309
00:44:02,735 --> 00:44:04,355
not how a civilized person would act

1310
00:44:04,595 --> 00:44:04,865
huh

1311
00:44:04,925 --> 00:44:07,025
you're not oh yes culpable for anything

1312
00:44:07,025 --> 00:44:09,065
when you're in your dreams totally and

1313
00:44:09,065 --> 00:44:10,475
i mean like i totally give it

1314
00:44:10,475 --> 00:44:11,735
to that woman that i injured her

1315
00:44:11,735 --> 00:44:12,845

stand this happens here all the time

1317
00:44:14,045 --> 00:44:15,785

like dr pepper whatever whatever i forget

1376
00:46:16,745 --> 00:46:17,855
what the shot is that you drop

1377

into the beer but it makes it

1378
00:46:18,725 --> 00:46:21,545

00:53:30,860 --> 00:53:32,300
it in a sentence we we have

1577
00:53:32,300 --> 00:53:35,540

00:53:35,570 --> 00:53:38,510
oh so you're trying to horn in

1579
00:53:38,510 --> 00:53:40,010

00:53:40,010 --> 00:53:41,720
what it was right yeah so

1581
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:45,920

1582
00:53:45,980 --> 00:53:47,630

yeah okay

1584
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:52,910
well intuitively i beg your vote and

1585
00:53:52,910 --> 00:53:56,840
deliberately people think that libraries are free

1586
00:53:57,740 --> 00:54:00,680
are they not they are it's just

1587
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:01,490
that they take a little bit of

1588
00:54:01,490 --> 00:54:03,560
your soul when hi guys hey i

1589
00:54:03,560 --> 00:54:05,660
were just talking about libraries oh intuitively

1590
00:54:06,620 --> 00:54:09,560
unrealistically speaking all things considered

1591
00:54:10,670 --> 00:54:13,310
by this things considered so listen to

1592
00:54:13,310 --> 00:54:16,610
that you content npr you the her

1593
00:54:16,610 --> 00:54:19,970
contention is that libraries are not free

1594
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:24,830
i think that they are free monetarily

1595
00:54:24,860 --> 00:54:26,720
but they're not free in the sense

1596
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:28,760
that they steal a little something from

1597
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:30,320
you and keep it like it was

1598
00:54:30,350 --> 00:54:31,760
like what like what but if your

1599
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:34,610
essence because i don't know so people

1600
00:54:34,610 --> 00:54:36,860
really go to libraries he says i

1601
00:54:36,860 --> 00:54:37,880

old older older people but they they

1603
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:41,240
fall in session

1604
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:43,220

00:54:43,220 --> 00:54:45,050

your essence if you go to the
