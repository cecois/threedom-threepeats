00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:37,350
kids are all reading it in comic

189
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:39,480

00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:42,720
batman wonder woman aquaman okay and win-win

191
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,030
the wonder twins were invented for work

192
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:47,850
this ah cartoon and their their space

193
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:49,860
monkey gleick yeah zan and jayna were

194
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:51,780
the wonder twins now now are the

195
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:54,030
phrase wonder twins activate when yeah powers

196
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:55,710
activate yeah have you ever actually seen

197
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:55,830
that

198
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:58,080
cartoon i don't think so they were

199
00:06:58,110 --> 00:06:59,580
one of them could turn into any

200
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:01,530
animal any animal and the other one

201
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:02,940
could turn to any form of water

202
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,370
now that became then because it's very

203
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,260
it's not very cinematic to turn into

204
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,300
water it became he would turn into

205
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,400
anything that was ice so form of

206
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,470
an ice latter ice a lot of

207
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:14,490
ice you know if they ever needed

208
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:15,990
anything to get form of an ice

209
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,690
go when they would travel um the

210
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:20,820
one would turn into an eagle and

211
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:23,880
would carry a bucket carry gleick the

212
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:26,310
space monkey who was carrying a bucket

213
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:28,560
where the other person the other wonder

214
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,080
twin a transformed into water well because

215
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,480
that was less heavy than a human

216
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,850
i guess i mean buckets watering is

217
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:36,240
very high

218
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,860
is very heavy but i guess not

219
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:39,360
as hard as a person because her

220
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,160
heavy as a person not as hard

221
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,350
as a person i've always said that

222
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,700
i can swim in water but i

223
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:45,570
can't throw in a person

224
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:48,210
yeah so much of our bodies are

225
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:50,190
made up of water so much so

226
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,680
i mean a good amount most of

227
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,250
it's in your head

228
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,160
meaning we're imagining that we're all made

229
00:07:56,730 --> 00:07:58,620
up yeah it's not really thank you

230
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:00,930

281
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,040
remember fuckin push it out of your

282
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:41,760

00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:50,790
course where it could probably so nervous

288
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:52,320
but the addition in front of everyone

289
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,660
else which having to make sense because

290
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:55,588
you have to see in place it

291
00:09:55,588 --> 00:09:57,300
would be better if if no one

292
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,260

293
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:00,030

and watching you audition that is really

297
00:10:04,365 --> 00:10:06,015
weird it's the same as an audience

298
00:10:06,015 --> 00:10:07,725
it's like these are my peers anytime

299
00:10:07,725 --> 00:10:09,825
you think anyone's judging you yeah it

300
00:10:09,825 --> 00:10:11,775

433
00:15:06,855 --> 00:15:07,425
was doing the shows

434
00:15:07,455 --> 00:15:08,535

girl rita who's in my class i

437
00:15:14,715 --> 00:15:17,085
remember her auditioning love and she's saying

438
00:15:17,115 --> 00:15:17,860
you don't meet

439
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:21,015
do your own version

440
00:15:22,215 --> 00:15:23,267
had a little fun with that yeah

441
00:15:23,267 --> 00:15:26,025
a little leave a little further north

442
00:15:26,565 --> 00:15:29,985
she did ah rainbow connection oh and

443
00:15:29,985 --> 00:15:32,895
she did a thing so mad oh

444
00:15:32,895 --> 00:15:35,415
not that one o different one yeah

445
00:15:35,775 --> 00:15:38,205
same same title did this thing where

446
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:42,188
um that that i see that you

447
00:15:42,257 --> 00:15:43,875
said people do where they they they

448
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:47,428
assume like a singing accent oh oh

449
00:15:47,445 --> 00:15:51,015
say yeah why aw that's so many

450
00:15:51,045 --> 00:15:52,755
like her val choices were different she

451
00:15:52,755 --> 00:15:54,465
wouldn't like say a hard r and

452
00:15:54,465 --> 00:15:56,865
i think that's usually because they're impersonating

453
00:15:56,865 --> 00:15:58,995
someone else who's singing it like there

454
00:15:58,995 --> 00:16:00,975

do all over ours really hard and

459
00:16:08,985 --> 00:16:10,305
i was like you don't do this

00:16:10,305 --> 00:16:11,445
when you speak she would always be

461
00:16:11,445 --> 00:16:14,385

462
00:16:14,385 --> 00:16:15,975

648
00:22:51,215 --> 00:22:52,745
lz exists insects

649
00:22:54,275 --> 00:22:56,405
sure but i'm not blind in really

650
00:22:56,405 --> 00:22:58,475
wanting through animals yes i'm saying i

651
00:22:58,475 --> 00:22:59,675
don't want to interact with them so

652
00:22:59,675 --> 00:23:01,055
i don't really care i'm saying like

653
00:23:01,055 --> 00:23:02,975
pets of mine look like things that

654
00:23:02,975 --> 00:23:04,445
have died already cared about

655
00:23:06,065 --> 00:23:09,185
i feel have a soul and exist

656
00:23:09,305 --> 00:23:11,165
in the a plane that is on

657
00:23:11,195 --> 00:23:14,075
the imperceptible to me but i don't

658
00:23:14,075 --> 00:23:16,085
really believe that everyone is gathered round

659
00:23:16,085 --> 00:23:18,245
but sometimes i do picture a heaven

660
00:23:18,245 --> 00:23:20,105
like thing and think like okay but

661
00:23:20,105 --> 00:23:22,535
i also think i don't really at

662
00:23:22,535 --> 00:23:23,075
the end of the day i don't

663
00:23:23,075 --> 00:23:24,485
really know enough about anything to say

664
00:23:24,485 --> 00:23:25,505
that something is or isn't true

665
00:23:25,805 --> 00:23:27,935
do you think it's feelings or do

666
00:23:27,935 --> 00:23:30,575
we have cases in which our souls

667
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:33,125
reside or are we just kind of

668
00:23:33,125 --> 00:23:35,945
floating along and and it's we don't

669
00:23:35,945 --> 00:23:37,325
we can't even imagine what it is

670
00:23:37,325 --> 00:23:38,375
i think that's what it is that

671
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:40,205
it's like some know science has not

672
00:23:40,265 --> 00:23:44,105
science yeah in our lab late one

673
00:23:44,105 --> 00:23:44,315

then you don't you aren't conscious of

683
00:24:02,165 --> 00:24:03,965

690
00:24:14,405 --> 00:24:16,325

00:25:46,948 --> 00:25:50,015
atheist and show it and she'll say

738
00:25:51,005 --> 00:25:52,415
yeah it's we talked about this every

739
00:25:52,415 --> 00:25:52,955
single day

740
00:25:54,125 --> 00:25:56,375
right before bed risers wake up

741
00:25:57,755 --> 00:25:59,555
um are you still in like nothing

742
00:25:59,735 --> 00:26:01,805
ice like i say if someone were

743
00:26:01,805 --> 00:26:03,935
to present me with i don't think

744
00:26:03,935 --> 00:26:05,495
there's a god but if someone would

745
00:26:05,615 --> 00:26:07,205
would present me with proof of god

746
00:26:07,565 --> 00:26:09,305
i wouldn't say well i don't believe

747
00:26:09,305 --> 00:26:11,255
that do you want yeah so it's

748
00:26:11,255 --> 00:26:12,905
just she says that means you're an

749
00:26:12,905 --> 00:26:14,915
agnostic because you don't know and i

750
00:26:14,915 --> 00:26:16,925
said yes i don't know for sure

751
00:26:16,925 --> 00:26:17,615
of course no one no

752
00:26:17,615 --> 00:26:20,105
is for sure but i don't think

753
00:26:20,105 --> 00:26:21,725
that there is i don't believe that

754
00:26:21,725 --> 00:26:22,955
which is what should tip you in

755
00:26:22,955 --> 00:26:25,385
atheism that's what tips me right that's

756
00:26:25,385 --> 00:26:27,245
why what if jesus wearing isn't courage

757
00:26:27,275 --> 00:26:28,595
what if you saw what did you

758
00:26:28,595 --> 00:26:30,455
saw jesus walking along and he curses

759
00:26:30,455 --> 00:26:31,805
a fig tree would you would that

760
00:26:31,805 --> 00:26:34,475
be proof yeah see you're both ain't

761
00:26:34,655 --> 00:26:36,425
what it takes for me yeah i

762
00:26:36,425 --> 00:26:37,775
think so alright

763
00:26:37,895 --> 00:26:39,305
i don't know i don't but i

764
00:26:39,305 --> 00:26:40,745
also don't i thought it's kind of

765
00:26:40,745 --> 00:26:42,095
i think it's just ah it just

766
00:26:42,095 --> 00:26:44,885
ah but i was raised with religion

767
00:26:44,915 --> 00:26:47,315
and yeah it's still the way that

768
00:26:47,315 --> 00:26:48,905
i live my life you know by

769
00:26:48,905 --> 00:26:51,215
those by those principles and the the

770
00:26:51,215 --> 00:26:53,765
thing that drives me so crazy as

771
00:26:53,795 --> 00:26:57,125
is you know false christians and and

772
00:26:57,125 --> 00:26:57,935
people who

773
00:26:57,965 --> 00:27:01,985
just won't acknowledge that they are not

774
00:27:01,985 --> 00:27:03,665
in line people who profess to be

775
00:27:03,665 --> 00:27:05,735
in line with the teachings of christ

776
00:27:05,735 --> 00:27:07,655
and are not at all yeah insane

777
00:27:07,655 --> 00:27:09,605
yes i'm whatever the laws are that's

778
00:27:09,605 --> 00:27:11,975
what render unto caesar sure i wanna

779
00:27:11,975 --> 00:27:14,345
say something i'm thinking about please that's

780
00:27:14,345 --> 00:27:16,385
how we introduce every idea we want

781
00:27:16,595 --> 00:27:17,855
i want to say something i'm thinking

782
00:27:17,855 --> 00:27:18,065
about

783
00:27:18,125 --> 00:27:19,922
thinking um i was thinking i'm just

784
00:27:19,922 --> 00:27:21,275
thinking about friends of mine who are

785
00:27:21,275 --> 00:27:25,385
raised by atheist parents and i think

786
00:27:25,385 --> 00:27:26,795
that they're fine and they have but

787
00:27:26,795 --> 00:27:28,565
they they from the get-go have the

788
00:27:28,595 --> 00:27:32,585
belief that there is nothing and i

789
00:27:32,795 --> 00:27:36,605
think almost for children it's nice to

790
00:27:36,605 --> 00:27:38,135
believe that there's something it was

791
00:27:38,285 --> 00:27:40,145
like santa claus someone's gonna say like

792
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:41,885
he's very comforting for me it's kind

793
00:27:41,885 --> 00:27:44,195
of like just kind of good like

794
00:27:44,195 --> 00:27:46,085
i didn't know much but i thought

795
00:27:46,355 --> 00:27:47,825
by the time i believed in god

796
00:27:47,855 --> 00:27:49,175
you're probably right but by the time

797
00:27:49,175 --> 00:27:51,365
i got to be twelve or whatever

798
00:27:51,365 --> 00:27:53,015
then it became very oppressive to me

799
00:27:53,015 --> 00:27:55,415
of like oh god i can't do

800
00:27:55,415 --> 00:27:57,515
anything that i think that i want

801
00:27:57,515 --> 00:27:58,415
to do because

802
00:27:58,535 --> 00:28:00,905
i'm going to be burning in hell

803
00:28:00,905 --> 00:28:02,135
and it just became yeah i sort

804
00:28:02,135 --> 00:28:04,115
of think wow i buy i'm happy

805
00:28:04,115 --> 00:28:05,735
with how it went for me and

806
00:28:05,735 --> 00:28:06,905
that like i believe that there was

807
00:28:06,905 --> 00:28:08,285
god but i didn't really know anything

808
00:28:08,285 --> 00:28:10,235
about it i didn't like go to

809
00:28:10,235 --> 00:28:12,245

810
00:28:12,245 --> 00:28:13,925

is part of what yeah was kind

828
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:46,835
of interesting but it's so boring to

829
00:28:46,895 --> 00:28:49,085
kids and listen to something at church

830
00:28:49,085 --> 00:28:50,855
in a different language but it's also

831
00:28:50,885 --> 00:28:52,385
cool because i've i'm not taking any

832
00:28:52,385 --> 00:28:52,925

so much yeah so what do you

927
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:14,390
what goes i mean i do think

928
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:18,050
there's something biological to that i babysat

929
00:32:18,050 --> 00:32:19,490
so many babies and change diapers and

930
00:32:19,490 --> 00:32:20,481
it did make me want to throw

931
00:32:20,481 --> 00:32:22,010
up many times because you didn't love

932
00:32:22,010 --> 00:32:23,275
them i mean i love them love

but i mean no i love them

935
00:32:26,870 --> 00:32:28,100
ah sorry too if someone were to

936
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:31,460
say there's an extra twenty dollars would

937
00:32:31,670 --> 00:32:32,300
then you feel it

938
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:36,796
but like it would be like yeah

939
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:39,710
jackson chad worthy the you know but

940
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:40,940
i think that's probably true but people's

941
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:44,030
own babies too sometimes but um actually

942
00:32:44,030 --> 00:32:45,230
i know somebody who can't change their

943
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:47,540
own kid sniper really i'm not gonna

944
00:32:47,570 --> 00:32:49,580
use a madonna from them um yeah

945
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:50,660
that's what ok let me think of

946
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:53,480
who you know but they they feel

947
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,330
sick at the idea wow

948
00:32:56,870 --> 00:33:00,050
i just mouse over i said no

949
00:33:00,050 --> 00:33:01,870
just in case anyone heard the whisper

950
00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:06,140
um yeah i just think there must

951
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:08,360
be some sort of biological thing to

952
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:13,310
protect children or something otherwise cavemen would

953
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:15,230
have just let you know let them

954
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:17,210
die or whatever your dogs or children

955
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:19,460
i think they aren't showing your fur

956
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:20,270
babies

957
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:22,940
i think there's something about when it's

958
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:24,981
your own it's your dog you've had

959
00:33:25,010 --> 00:33:27,320
an sara puppy you're probably really familiar

960
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:30,124
with the scent of their specific yeah

961
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:32,180
but really that like then like a

962
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:33,890
dog that you don't know i mean

963
00:33:33,890 --> 00:33:35,000
my dog shits but that's what i'm

964
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,280
saying is it was my dog's poop

965
00:33:37,670 --> 00:33:39,320
so i do it's a weird shape

966
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:40,160
and you made up in your head

967
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,330
that it wasn't theirs

968
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:42,740
well it was shaped like a coyote

969
00:33:42,950 --> 00:33:44,180
it was because he was the morning

970
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:46,100
it was like put together biscuits of

971
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:48,200
their shit what that looks like cody

972
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,700
it's like a cookie-cutter of a coyote

973
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:53,090
this is what look okay when a

974
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,380
coyote shits in the shape of a

975
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:56,840
coyote yeah that would make everything car

976
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:59,411
so much easier if whenever any organisms

977
00:33:59,411 --> 00:34:00,770
shit was in the shape of what

978
00:34:00,770 --> 00:34:01,610
it was because he

979
00:34:01,670 --> 00:34:03,500
pooped little people shaped poops i don't

980
00:34:03,530 --> 00:34:04,400
think out like what if it looked

981
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,048
exactly like you i'd love it and

982
00:34:06,048 --> 00:34:07,940
what if what if your bud hole

983
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:11,300
had like a fingerprint you what if

984
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:13,850
your bud holes a probably guys from

985
00:34:13,850 --> 00:34:16,503
everyone stick to their light show

986
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:21,110
my family had a thing a discussion

987
00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:23,660
one time about if you were to

988
00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:25,940
ah take a bite of something that

989
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:27,680
somebody else bit into like a piece

990
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:29,720
of toast or something i think that

991
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:31,190
i tend to not like that i

992
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:32,300
tend to like that but if it's

993
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:34,910
your if it's your like my my

994
00:34:35,090 --> 00:34:37,880
siblings who had kids were saying

995
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:40,730
they didn't mind it if it was

996
00:34:40,790 --> 00:34:43,610
like their kid right because and this

997
00:34:43,610 --> 00:34:45,830
was raising another because they are of

998
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:48,230
me yeah right your significant other yeah

999
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:51,380
but but sibling to sibling know you

1000
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:52,370
have to say what's on i use

1001
00:34:52,370 --> 00:34:53,990
my brother's deodorant and he was like

1002
00:34:53,990 --> 00:34:55,460
why don't you just keep that i

1003
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:56,270
was like oh i didn't know that

1004
00:34:56,270 --> 00:34:57,980
was so busy other thing you think

1005
00:34:58,070 --> 00:34:59,450
like soap in the shower with a

1006
00:34:59,450 --> 00:35:02,810
roommate bizarre right but but soap doesn't

1007
00:35:02,810 --> 00:35:04,492
get dirty but here's the thing i

1008
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:05,534
mean that's such a weird thing that

1009
00:35:05,534 --> 00:35:06,620
you should say that not to interrupt

1010
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:09,230
you but i am but just because

1011
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:10,610
it's exactly what a bad take for

1012
00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:13,310
seventh grade i remember in science class

1013
00:35:13,310 --> 00:35:16,100
really wanting to ask my science teacher

1014
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:18,200
about if soap had germs

1015
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:19,310
on it right but i thought it

1016
00:35:19,310 --> 00:35:20,930
was a dumb question i never asked

1017
00:35:20,930 --> 00:35:22,160
and i've honestly thought about it my

1018
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,350
whole life well let's figure it out

1019
00:35:24,410 --> 00:35:26,240
come on right sidebar yes one of

1020
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,770
you said when i was in when

1021
00:35:27,770 --> 00:35:30,350
i was in um a chemistry class

1022
00:35:30,350 --> 00:35:31,400
jew i was a junior in high

1023
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,230
school the only class i ever failed

1024

i'd go to summer school forget well

1025
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:36,560
you didn't know much about chemistry that

1026
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:37,490
sound macho

1027
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:40,100
that's the that's the only i think

1028
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:41,390
that's the only i don't know much

1029
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:44,840
about science i don't know much about

1030
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:48,530
science book don't know my friend chad

1031
00:35:48,530 --> 00:35:51,770
took um i i had this chemistry

1032
00:35:51,770 --> 00:35:55,100
teacher and i he's he was he

1033
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:57,620
fancied himself a very funny guy and

1034
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:58,520
like a cool teacher

1035
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:00,800
yeah and it sounds rad that was

1036
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,240
my seventh grade times youtube he was

1037
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,560
like he would say bullshit in front

1038
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:06,050
of us it was like oh but

1039
00:36:06,050 --> 00:36:08,300
he's dude rules he said he used

1040
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:09,470
to say there's no such thing you

1041
00:36:09,470 --> 00:36:10,520
can ask me anything there's no such

1042
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:13,100
thing as a stupid question and i

1043
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:15,080
remember once asking him because i'd heard

1044
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:16,850
this and of course it doesn't make

1045
00:36:16,850 --> 00:36:18,680
any sense when i was

1046
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:20,090
a kid i had heard that hot

1047
00:36:20,090 --> 00:36:22,730
water freezes faster than cold water oh

1048
00:36:22,730 --> 00:36:25,490
yeah i said stupid shit like well

1049
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:27,140
i've i didn't think so and i

1050
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:28,460
was assured that there was no such

1051
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:30,200
thing and i asked the guy in

1052
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,820
front of the class and he ridiculed

1053
00:36:31,850 --> 00:36:34,190
wow that's some fast and that's it's

1054
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:36,830
shit one more thing my seventh grade

1055
00:36:36,830 --> 00:36:38,660
science teacher he was also really funny

1056
00:36:38,870 --> 00:36:41,150
and i loved that of course and

1057
00:36:41,210 --> 00:36:42,890
i was reading i was in seventh

1058
00:36:42,890 --> 00:36:44,120
grade did you have different teachers for

1059
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:46,460
different subjects yeah okay i had sort

1060
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:48,260
of like the same teacher first through

1061
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:49,760
eighth it was it was one teacher

1062
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,320
for every class that's so much pressure

1063
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:53,990
on one person it's ridiculous um i

1064
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:55,790
was reading the book sign language by

1065
00:36:55,790 --> 00:36:57,920
jerry seinfeld yeah and i thought and

1066
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:58,910
i loved it thought it was so

1067
00:36:58,910 --> 00:36:59,000

any and then i gay i've always

1069
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:02,720

since i was thirteen yeah but i

1071
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:07,820
gave it to your boyfriend with six

1072
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:09,560
yeah i lent it to him i

1073
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,030
lent it to my teacher thinking oh

you'll like this too because you're funny

1075
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:14,150
and then he never goes back i

1076
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:16,100
was pissed what i think though i

1077
00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:17,930
gave it to him and i was

1078
00:37:17,930 --> 00:37:19,160
like i never ask for it back

1079
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:21,860
i was overthinking that's a very specific

1080
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:23,600
thing when you loan something that someone

1081
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:26,180
made you you realize oh they think

1082
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:27,290
that was oh i didn't make it

have no idea how i how i

1087
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:35,210

00:42:01,805 --> 00:42:03,455
as an adult you're saying this yet

1225
00:42:03,515 --> 00:42:04,715
on a rainy day like today

1226
00:42:04,715 --> 00:42:06,725
yeah it was all but paralyzed longer

1227
00:42:06,755 --> 00:42:08,705
know what happened initially was as babysitting

1228
00:42:08,705 --> 00:42:09,755
this kid and this was when i

1229
00:42:09,755 --> 00:42:11,255
lived in new york and i said

1230
00:42:11,255 --> 00:42:12,545
look at that umbrella and it's about

1231
00:42:12,545 --> 00:42:14,045
a balloon and i was like why

1232
00:42:14,048 --> 00:42:15,575
did i just say and then i

1233
00:42:15,635 --> 00:42:18,425
haven't got hands multiple times and like

1234
00:42:18,485 --> 00:42:20,195
oh my god now i still make

1235
00:42:20,225 --> 00:42:21,635
i think about both of those words

1236
00:42:21,635 --> 00:42:23,975
together so so for either of them

1237
00:42:24,065 --> 00:42:24,845
you may say

1238
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:26,225
the opposite yeah i don't know that

1239
00:42:26,225 --> 00:42:27,245
i've ever called a number like a

1240
00:42:27,245 --> 00:42:29,165
balloon but i've worried that i have

1241
00:42:30,995 --> 00:42:32,915
i mean they're they're definitely on the

1242
00:42:32,915 --> 00:42:35,075
same plane as far as you still

1243
00:42:35,105 --> 00:42:37,205
have straight up what was your silly

1244
00:42:37,205 --> 00:42:39,095
words go yeah they could just as

1245
00:42:39,095 --> 00:42:41,615

rules great just ban everyone from saying

1329
00:45:25,385 --> 00:45:27,935
yes or no huh choose one person

1330
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:30,425
to start he or she has only

1331
00:45:30,425 --> 00:45:32,525
one minute to answer as many questions

1332
00:45:32,525 --> 00:45:33,215
from the group as

1333
00:45:33,275 --> 00:45:36,875
possible without answering yes or no if

1334
00:45:36,875 --> 00:45:38,045
they make it to the end without

1335
00:45:38,045 --> 00:45:40,145
tripping up they get a point all

1336
00:45:40,145 --> 00:45:42,485
questions need to be answered any hesitations

1337
00:45:42,545 --> 00:45:45,425
ums or us impose a ten second

1338
00:45:45,425 --> 00:45:47,765
penalty come on amzn us layer with

1339
00:45:47,765 --> 00:45:49,385
the most points wins that's the whole

1340
00:45:49,385 --> 00:45:51,725
point so the points are kept by

1341
00:45:51,725 --> 00:45:53,435
what how many questions you answer

1342
00:45:53,555 --> 00:45:55,204
oh no if you're doable round to

1343
00:45:55,204 --> 00:45:57,095
get one point yeah and you end

1344
00:45:57,095 --> 00:45:59,555
if you do amore ah you get

1345
00:45:59,555 --> 00:46:02,255
added ten seconds that you lose you

1346
00:46:02,255 --> 00:46:04,115
lose time now but it would be

1347
00:46:04,115 --> 00:46:06,215
gaining time because it's losing time would

1348
00:46:06,215 --> 00:46:08,105
be to your advantage because then your

1349
00:46:08,105 --> 00:46:10,115
time would be over quicker but then

1350
00:46:10,115 --> 00:46:11,615
that means there's fewer questions that you

1351
00:46:11,615 --> 00:46:13,115
get to answer so you you have

1352
00:46:13,115 --> 00:46:13,595
to but you don't

1353
00:46:13,595 --> 00:46:15,185
you get points per questions you get

1354
00:46:15,185 --> 00:46:17,135
points for getting through the entire period

1355
00:46:17,135 --> 00:46:18,845
without fucking tripping up as if you

1356
00:46:18,845 --> 00:46:20,195
have more time you have more time

1357
00:46:20,195 --> 00:46:22,175
to say yes or no so yeah

1358
00:46:22,505 --> 00:46:23,585

like i'm i make some yeah i

1572
00:54:14,435 --> 00:54:16,225
think that they're good and that that's

1573
00:54:16,225 --> 00:54:18,355
why people would rather murder their wives

1574
00:54:18,385 --> 00:54:19,105
then divorce them

1575
00:54:20,455 --> 00:54:23,005
because they're standing with their friends will

1576
00:54:23,455 --> 00:54:24,655
go down yeah you know what i

1577
00:54:24,655 --> 00:54:26,425
mean like kill them it's like it's

1578
00:54:26,425 --> 00:54:27,715
not about it's use i don't think

1579
00:54:27,715 --> 00:54:30,265
it's about money sometimes maybe it is

1580
00:54:30,265 --> 00:54:31,675
about money oh my god i can't

1581
00:54:31,675 --> 00:54:33,265
get divorced because then suddenly i'm not

1582
00:54:33,265 --> 00:54:35,005
going to have all only have half

1583
00:54:35,005 --> 00:54:36,314
my money or whatever but i think

1584
00:54:36,325 --> 00:54:37,315
if you're talking about people who really

1585
00:54:37,315 --> 00:54:38,725
think they're getting away with they're gonna

1586
00:54:38,755 --> 00:54:40,105
get away with it yeah like she'll

1587
00:54:40,105 --> 00:54:40,315
she'll

1588
00:54:40,450 --> 00:54:42,085
disappear i'll get all the sympathy no

1589
00:54:42,085 --> 00:54:42,904
i don't think i'm a bad i

1590
00:54:42,955 --> 00:54:44,635
really think it's because they want sympathy

1591
00:54:44,635 --> 00:54:45,865
i think it's because they're like i

1592
00:54:45,865 --> 00:54:47,815
can't imagine a world where i have

1593
00:54:47,815 --> 00:54:49,465
to go to all of my friends

1594
00:54:49,465 --> 00:54:52,015
and family and say remember that wedding

1595
00:54:52,015 --> 00:54:53,965
that we had i think that's a

1596
00:54:53,965 --> 00:54:55,675
big part of it for a lot

1597
00:54:55,675 --> 00:54:57,745
of people i remember what a friend

1598
00:54:57,745 --> 00:55:00,385
of mine was getting divorced after years

1599
00:55:00,385 --> 00:55:00,505
of

1600
00:55:00,535 --> 00:55:02,665
marriage and he was the way he

1601
00:55:02,665 --> 00:55:04,525
was framing it was i have to

1602
00:55:04,525 --> 00:55:07,105
face that i i am in a

1603
00:55:07,105 --> 00:55:09,325
failed marriage right i failed and i

1604
00:55:09,325 --> 00:55:11,335
was like well i don't need any

1605
00:55:11,455 --> 00:55:12,985
kids and everything yeah and it's like

1606
00:55:13,045 --> 00:55:15,115
but it's like you can't look at

1607
00:55:15,115 --> 00:55:16,855
it like it's a personal failure like

1608
00:55:16,885 --> 00:55:19,075
obviously the thing wasn't working and is

1609
00:55:19,075 --> 00:55:20,695
better for your kids that you

1610
00:55:20,695 --> 00:55:23,725
i don't stay together somewhere for reasons

1611
00:55:23,785 --> 00:55:25,435
like full divorce it's like yeah your

1612
00:55:25,435 --> 00:55:27,715
microwave hey if your microwave isn't working

1613
00:55:27,715 --> 00:55:28,975
you don't have to like carry guilt

1614
00:55:28,975 --> 00:55:30,355
about it like i have to accept

1615
00:55:30,355 --> 00:55:32,185
that my microwave isn't working yeah and

1616
00:55:32,185 --> 00:55:33,475
like things change i don't know i

1617
00:55:33,475 --> 00:55:36,265
don't think it's like ah you know

1618
00:55:36,265 --> 00:55:39,175
your perception of your existence changes as

1619
00:55:39,175 --> 00:55:40,855
you get older and your relation

1620
00:55:40,855 --> 00:55:43,225
kinship dynamic changes and if you have

1621
00:55:43,225 --> 00:55:44,605
kids that's a whole nother thing that

1622
00:55:44,605 --> 00:55:46,405
changes that it's like the idea that

1623
00:55:46,405 --> 00:55:48,715
you're expected to just do something because

1624
00:55:48,715 --> 00:55:50,455
you said at one time right is

1625
00:55:50,455 --> 00:55:52,075
actually crazy yeah but i think there

1626
00:55:52,075 --> 00:55:53,485
are people out there who have like

1627
00:55:53,575 --> 00:55:55,975
they they love their standing in the

1628
00:55:55,975 --> 00:55:57,685
community i mean i think about people

1629
00:55:58,435 --> 00:55:59,695
that were in the church when i

1630
00:55:59,695 --> 00:56:01,015
was growing yeah who

1631
00:56:01,015 --> 00:56:03,055
who there was one oh that aspect

1632
00:56:03,055 --> 00:56:04,465
is a whole yeah there was one

1633
00:56:04,465 --> 00:56:07,255
layout like there was one deacon i

1634
00:56:07,255 --> 00:56:10,045
remember who's who was dating someone my

1635
00:56:10,045 --> 00:56:12,955

1636
00:56:12,955 --> 00:56:14,995
or whatever but like a married deacon

1637
00:56:14,995 --> 00:56:17,305
who who's who was like fifteen years

1638

1684
00:57:39,295 --> 00:57:40,645
think anyone's going to get divorced because

1685
00:57:40,645 --> 00:57:41,815
you when you meet the key

1686
00:57:41,815 --> 00:57:44,065

1687
00:57:44,065 --> 00:57:46,375
they are which is always bickering or

1688
00:57:46,375 --> 00:57:48,295
whatever anything i guess that's just their

1689
00:57:48,295 --> 00:57:50,275
dynamic know what though i think okay

1690
00:57:50,275 --> 00:57:52,615
having been divorced i think that i

1691
00:57:52,645 --> 00:57:55,315
can see it more like i was

1692
00:57:55,375 --> 00:57:56,755
like oh they should get divorced and

1693
00:57:56,759 --> 00:57:58,135
they don't like sweet so you have

1694
00:57:58,135 --> 00:58:00,805
like the dare devil divorce radar yeah

1695
00:58:01,195 --> 00:58:01,555
because

1696
00:58:02,005 --> 00:58:03,385
a divorce x but i just think

1697
00:58:03,385 --> 00:58:05,605
it's like with toxic waste bourne is

1698
00:58:05,605 --> 00:58:09,055
completely blind deaf she cannot speak

1699
00:58:10,135 --> 00:58:11,305
this is all echolocation

1700
00:58:15,085 --> 00:58:17,095
whatever so you think you're able to

1701
00:58:17,095 --> 00:58:18,385
see so do you see it with

1702
00:58:18,385 --> 00:58:21,265
us i don't i don't actually but

1703
00:58:21,265 --> 00:58:23,755
i i feel like it's i mean

1704
00:58:23,845 --> 00:58:24,775
i don't even want to talk about

1705
00:58:24,775 --> 00:58:26,606
people because you know i wouldn't want

1706
00:58:26,606 --> 00:58:27,745
to i don't hope for people to

1707
00:58:27,745 --> 00:58:30,235
go through a painful experience but i

1708
00:58:30,235 --> 00:58:31,555
