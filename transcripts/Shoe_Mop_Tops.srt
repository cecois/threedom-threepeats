42
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:48,930
that's how i three or four loop

43
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:53,130
kiddos that was remember tim allen he

44
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:54,870
would make the noise and people thought

45
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:57,900
it was great man was it probably

46
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:02,940
stand-up yeah we're standards lower or where

47
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:04,620
it was or just not only entertainment

48
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:06,990
that anyone could see no one did

49
00:02:07,009 --> 00:02:07,620
noises

50
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,870
before here's what here's what's interesting about

51
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:11,760
that to me now i loved that

52
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,188
show but i was a child now

53
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:16,470
as they were both made for adults

54
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:20,400
i mean when you became billy when

55
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,510
you became a man you put away

56
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:24,360
childish things right oh yeah and rap

57
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,160
i think that for some reason wrap

58
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:27,150
the shrimp

59
00:02:28,518 --> 00:02:30,115
put on your rap rap

60
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:33,690
rep coop so the idea is that

61
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:34,830
day

62
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:38,760
it was made for families and so

63
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,070
it had to be in this middle

64
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:43,560
place where it could appeal to absolutely

65
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:48,330
everybody um without fear of repercussions paul

66
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:49,860

ooh no in the traditional sense

365
00:15:03,945 --> 00:15:06,705

375
00:15:30,795 --> 00:15:33,195
what i'm cruel which which which by

376
00:15:33,195 --> 00:15:34,065
the way that

377
00:15:34,575 --> 00:15:37,935
tacitly is saying that he is bald

378
00:15:37,995 --> 00:15:39,015
and not just that he has a

379
00:15:39,015 --> 00:15:40,965
short haircut i thought they were always

380
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:42,495
kind ever thought he has a short

381
00:15:42,495 --> 00:15:44,475
haircut he has one hair no i

382
00:15:44,475 --> 00:15:44,835
think that

383
00:15:46,095 --> 00:15:47,085
i think that was supposed to be

384
00:15:47,085 --> 00:15:50,685
the official thing i feel like i

385
00:15:50,685 --> 00:15:54,075

00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:26,329
house we had to be pumping it

571
00:22:26,329 --> 00:22:28,790
out with these machines and we had

572
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:30,980
to throw out a bunch of clothes

573
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:32,000
that were in the hopefully not those

574
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:34,430
terminator machines boy they're gonna take over

575
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:37,130
the world ah no it wasn't that

576
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:39,380
it was some sort of reverse fan

577
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:41,180
situation but i

578
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:42,650
i am not a terminator

579
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:46,850
the ah frank fell into our window

580
00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:48,860
well and got trapped than the guy

581
00:22:48,890 --> 00:22:50,570
the animal control came and she's like

582
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:53,090
what's my one move this all i

583
00:22:53,090 --> 00:22:54,560
know how to do i can't get

584
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,600
out of here so here goes well

585
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,730
in the animal control guy shot him

586
00:22:58,730 --> 00:23:00,590

i can't remember who it was they

809
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:54,560
came up with like the perfect punchline

810
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:56,210
that wrapped up the whole like the

811
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:58,070
the perfect button on the whole thing

812
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:00,830
everyone was laughing and i have this

813
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:03,080
weird thought of my head and i

814
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:04,370
knew what i was doing

815
00:31:05,810 --> 00:31:07,070
but it still

816
00:31:09,050 --> 00:31:11,301
as everyone is laughing like one second

817
00:31:11,301 --> 00:31:13,220
and everyone's laughter at this thing that

818
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:15,770
was perfect i said why oh it

819
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:19,040
and everyone stopped and i said coney

820
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:22,670
twenty twelve and then a couple people

821
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:24,860
felt bad and laughed and i was

822
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:27,770
like oh nah wasn't the in my

823
00:31:27,770 --> 00:31:28,250
mind

824
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:29,150
the point was

825
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:31,850
this thing that was just said was

826
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:33,710
perfect what i'm saying is lame and

827
00:31:33,710 --> 00:31:35,746
that was funny to me i guess

828
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:37,940
but i didn't know one could get

829
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:39,620
that at that oh everybody was like

830
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:40,850
oh no he really thought that was

831
00:31:40,850 --> 00:31:42,950
gonna be even funny oh my god

832
00:31:42,950 --> 00:31:45,710
that tells me it was mortifying isn't

833
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:47,690
like like it's always the worst i

834
00:31:47,690 --> 00:31:49,190
mean it happens all the time when

835
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:50,420
you're a funny person

836
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:51,320
in that you will say things that

837
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:53,030
aren't funny like just thank you

838
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:55,580
i mean but it's just it's a

839
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,110
natural part of being funny that you're

840
00:31:57,110 --> 00:31:59,150
gonna have some clunkers for sure but

841
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:01,400
it's the worst feeling in the world

842
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,990
i think like when you like things

843
00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:03,830
so it's gonna be funny and then

844
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:05,960
it's not i would rather bomb on

845
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:08,540
stage than have a joke knock over

846
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:10,100
in front of people in life

847
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:13,010
what's what's worse is when you say

848
00:32:13,010 --> 00:32:14,990
something really funny and your two friends

849
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:16,670
shit on you and say it's not

850
00:32:16,670 --> 00:32:19,070
funny but it actually is funny ca

851
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:21,260
you say something funny that doesn't happen

852
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:22,550
to me i think you guys are

853
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:24,290

854
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:30,002

00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:33,560
be a virgin birth caused by the

930
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:36,560
holy spirit on the slide servant mary

931
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,000
answered may your word to me be

932
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,640

933
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:41,780

he appears to zechariah and then he

938
00:35:49,409 --> 00:35:51,410

941
00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:00,230

1150
00:44:13,290 --> 00:44:16,440

1151
00:44:16,470 --> 00:44:18,900
my entire life i wanna say before

1152
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:22,110
the age of forty one is mortifying

1153
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:23,640
so i haven't even had years not

1154
00:44:23,670 --> 00:44:25,560
growing until i'll be not mortified i

1155
00:44:25,590 --> 00:44:28,347

1156
00:44:28,347 --> 00:44:30,930

1157
00:44:30,930 --> 00:44:32,460
ever done i think i ate well

1158
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:35,007
that's obvious yeah you think you nail

1159
00:44:35,011 --> 00:44:37,140
every interaction i think that shows through

1160
00:44:38,310 --> 00:44:41,100
um and then and then i'm then

1161
00:44:41,250 --> 00:44:42,660
then i got an apartment i was

1162
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:43,830
in an apartment with

1163
00:44:45,270 --> 00:44:47,730
oh boy oh boy oh boy i

1164
00:44:47,730 --> 00:44:49,260
had a bunch of roommates at the

1165
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:51,720
same time at wo meaning they all

1166
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:53,550
moved in at the same time we

1167
00:44:53,550 --> 00:44:55,320
all moved into this house together this

1168
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:57,720
rowhouse well this won't happen here just

1169
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:00,330
for everyone who plays this game now

1170
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:02,700
we're gonna hear roommates too through whatever

1171
00:45:02,790 --> 00:45:04,728
you know with you yeah and

1172
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:06,720
they were all in the person and

1173
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:08,970
hear two through wherever you do we

1174
00:45:08,970 --> 00:45:11,040
do it by living space not by

1175
00:45:11,430 --> 00:45:14,820
the person although although right now yeah

1176
00:45:15,075 --> 00:45:16,200
you do it you do it by

1177
00:45:16,230 --> 00:45:19,500
chronologically meaning if you had three roommates

1178
00:45:19,530 --> 00:45:21,420
and then one moves out and another

1179
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:23,100
one moves in that that one who

1180
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:25,050
moves in that's your next one that

1181
00:45:25,050 --> 00:45:25,170
does

1182
00:45:25,170 --> 00:45:26,370

forget it

1238
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:43,800
so we lived in this in this

1239
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:46,800
house um which was not i remember

1240
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:49,830
the houses was pretty good but we

1241
00:47:49,830 --> 00:47:52,650
were all nobody was really that responsible

1242
00:47:52,650 --> 00:47:53,940
so things would get shut off like

1243
00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:56,280
we had a phone um that we

1244
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:57,630
all share that got shut off and

1245
00:47:57,630 --> 00:47:58,860
never turned back on again

1246
00:47:59,550 --> 00:48:01,470
i think our gas got turned off

1247
00:48:01,470 --> 00:48:03,150
so we couldn't cook and so when

1248
00:48:03,150 --> 00:48:04,128
your phone got turned off or you're

1249
00:48:04,128 --> 00:48:05,250
just like i don't have a phone

1250
00:48:05,250 --> 00:48:06,750
there's no way to reach me because

1251
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:10,260
that work one hundred percent right yes

1252
00:48:10,290 --> 00:48:12,750

00:48:12,750 --> 00:48:13,620
to be like i'm going to go

1254
00:48:13,620 --> 00:48:15,270

it the generation before us

1392
00:52:53,625 --> 00:52:56,295
yeah sure i mean there's something intuitive

1393
00:52:56,295 --> 00:52:57,915
about it though reading it right there

1394
00:52:57,915 --> 00:52:58,965
to be look at it like this

1395
00:52:58,965 --> 00:53:02,044
is a foreign language really i mean

1396
00:53:02,055 --> 00:53:03,885
er geez i guess g's are the

1397
00:53:03,885 --> 00:53:07,065
biggest difference no but you know because

1398
00:53:07,245 --> 00:53:08,835
if you're just printing a lowercase g

1399
00:53:08,835 --> 00:53:10,725
it looks like a no yeah upper

1400
00:53:10,725 --> 00:53:13,515
case g doesn't look like the printed

1401
00:53:13,545 --> 00:53:13,755
upper

1402
00:53:13,785 --> 00:53:17,145
case g no it doesn't it's true

1403
00:53:17,325 --> 00:53:18,915
it looks like a shield or something

1404
00:53:19,245 --> 00:53:21,461

1405
00:53:21,461 --> 00:53:22,725

00:55:50,025 --> 00:55:52,125
any human being named fido

00:56:03,165 --> 00:56:04,995
fido the person you don't have that's

1479
00:56:04,995 --> 00:56:07,305
just it's just a dog name like

1480
00:56:07,305 --> 00:56:10,125
why is it exclusively for dogs why

1481
00:56:10,125 --> 00:56:12,015
is fido where did even come from

1482
00:56:12,255 --> 00:56:14,235
so good question you know like why

1483
00:56:14,265 --> 00:56:15,555

fido i'd like to be about righto

1485
00:56:17,595 --> 00:56:19,455

1487
00:56:21,615 --> 00:56:22,635
short i am faith

1488
00:56:22,635 --> 00:56:25,125
hateful not surprisingly abraham lincoln named his

1489
00:56:25,125 --> 00:56:26,715
dog fido around five years before he

1490
00:56:26,715 --> 00:56:29,205
became president perhaps surprising from bouts of

1491
00:56:29,205 --> 00:56:31,575
depression pets often pulled him from anguish

1492
00:56:31,905 --> 00:56:33,735
that's just something i know my jesus

1493
00:56:35,025 --> 00:56:37,275
hold him from anguish what a weird

1494
00:56:37,275 --> 00:56:39,855
third sentence on the wikipedia entry for

out five years before becoming president in

1501
00:56:56,535 --> 00:56:58,731

1659
01:02:17,655 --> 01:02:19,065
put the cushions down on the floor

1669
01:02:38,535 --> 01:02:40,365
any trouble and actually you know i

1670
01:02:40,365 --> 01:02:43,335

1680
01:03:05,055 --> 01:03:06,645
with her and if she were staying

1681
01:03:06,645 --> 01:03:08,625

the executives was

1805
01:07:44,691 --> 01:07:47,265
so afraid of snakes that we could

1806

not write snakes into the show no

1807
01:07:50,055 --> 01:07:51,645
we were not allowed because they said

1808
01:07:51,645 --> 01:07:53,085
she she won't be able to watch

1809
01:07:53,085 --> 01:07:55,125
the episode so she won't be able

1810
01:07:55,125 --> 01:07:56,865
to approve the episode if there's a

1811
01:07:56,865 --> 01:07:58,665
snake oh my she's so and it

1812
01:07:58,665 --> 01:08:00,975
hypnotized any comedy sketch that had a

1813
01:08:00,975 --> 01:08:03,825
snake so so at one point just

1814
01:08:03,825 --> 01:08:04,395
to be

1815
01:08:04,845 --> 01:08:06,375
to be funny or whatever we wrote

1816
01:08:07,185 --> 01:08:09,585
one sketch that that went up the

1817
01:08:09,585 --> 01:08:11,205
chain of like it was attack of

1818
01:08:11,205 --> 01:08:12,465
the snakes and he was just like

1819
01:08:12,465 --> 01:08:14,505
ten pages of snakes jumping out all

1820
01:08:14,505 --> 01:08:15,945
the time and were like hey this

1821
01:08:15,945 --> 01:08:17,205
is this is the sketch we're really

1822
01:08:17,205 --> 01:08:20,295
interested in doing next and it came

1823
01:08:20,295 --> 01:08:21,885
back like they're like we can't even

1824
01:08:21,885 --> 01:08:24,555
show this to her the italy there's

1825
01:08:24,555 --> 01:08:24,975
no way

1826
01:08:25,005 --> 01:08:26,865
you can ever do this of this

1827
01:08:27,435 --> 01:08:28,935
and we're like what that's it's really

1828
01:08:28,935 --> 01:08:30,795
funny though don't you think i'm very

1829
01:08:30,795 --> 01:08:33,165
intrigued did you try to write it

1830
01:08:33,165 --> 01:08:35,835
as a funny sketch i do actually

1831
01:08:35,865 --> 01:08:37,185
try to make it a rarely adjust

1832
01:08:37,215 --> 01:08:38,865
it was purely just nature's others and

1833
01:08:38,865 --> 01:08:41,235
it comes out exactly where like it's

1834
01:08:41,235 --> 01:08:43,005
really funny though don't think they didn't

1837
01:08:45,135 --> 01:08:48,825
can't know of this hobble but but

1838
01:08:48,825 --> 01:08:49,995
if you see a snake in the

1839
01:08:49,995 --> 01:08:52,005
first couple of years it's because we

1840
01:08:52,005 --> 01:08:54,765
snuck one past and they were like

1841
01:08:55,185 --> 01:08:56,955

one because you wanted to have one

1844
01:08:59,985 --> 01:09:01,575

the look on their lyrics i was

1888
01:10:44,295 --> 01:10:45,105

01:10:57,220 --> 01:10:58,570
yeah because i know we have to

1898
01:10:58,570 --> 01:10:59,620
