yeah yeah oh yeah so when i

84
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,540
was when i was a kid i

85
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:25,740
read all those books first i read

86
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:27,600
the hobbit then i read the three

87
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:29,100
the trilogy how did you get interested

88
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:31,020
in them was it the cartoon or

89
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,286
you know the rank and you know

90
00:03:32,286 --> 00:03:34,590
what i don't it was i think

91
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:36,232
it was rankin bass but it was

92
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:38,370
it was ralph bakshi was that the

93
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:39,540
enemy ralph bakshi yeah

94
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:41,310
but i just watched it all i

95
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:42,930
think i read the book first and

96
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:44,430
i don't know who turned me onto

97
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:45,685
that but i remember reading it and

98
00:03:45,697 --> 00:03:47,190
loved it i really like a bunch

99
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:49,020
of times where you ended dungeons and

100
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,240
dragons or anything i wasn't really i

101
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,640
want anything i of natalie or no

102
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,530
not really not strongly that was it

103
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:57,240
for me like i was probably more

104
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,350
into sci-fi as a kid than i

105
00:03:58,350 --> 00:03:59,370
wasn't a fantasy

106
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:01,050
um that was kind of the extent

107
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:02,578
of my fantasy was section of cycle

108
00:04:02,578 --> 00:04:04,620
hobbit the fiction that's right i'm a

109
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,450
science science denyer you take something a

110
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:07,979
little bit true and you make a

111
00:04:07,979 --> 00:04:10,020
little bit fun you take something a

112
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:11,430
little bit truly they had a little

113
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:13,440
things like cars like swords they exist

114
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,760
right but what if they were lasers

115
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:16,110
i just want to alien for the

116
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:17,520
first time so it's a little bit

117
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,920
swiftly oh it's a little alien

118
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:22,350
little bit of sci-fi especially the part

119
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:24,300
about that that's like a monster from

120
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,220
another planet and spaceships like the pile

121
00:04:26,225 --> 00:04:28,107
with all like being themselves and i'm

122
00:04:28,107 --> 00:04:29,580
like this is real but here's the

123
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:31,470
thing about the hobbit vs the lord

124
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:33,300
of the rings and this is why

125
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:36,150
it's become so like in in hearing

126
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:38,580
you talk about the hobbit movies which

127
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:39,720
i think i only ever saw the

128
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,020
first

129
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,700
one i was so mad that ah

130
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:42,840
because i didn't realize it was going

131
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,610
to be a trilogy as well oh

132
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:46,530
really and it was so they added

133
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:48,000
all this darkness to it that wasn't

134
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,320
in the book and it really bothered

135
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:50,100
my old friend

136
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,010
darkness he says a little by the

137
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:54,030
way oh shit

138
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:58,350
tom hi back ah was that it's

139
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:00,660
like so j r r tolkien writes

140
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:03,210
this book and it it does well

141
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:05,460
and then he's like i'm gonna retrofit

142
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:08,130
this this element of the book to

143
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:12,420
become this incredibly dark thing that in

144
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:14,100
the in the original book was just

145
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:14,280
like

146
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,890
it turns you invisible what's in that

147
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,990
the the original book was the habit

148
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,420
was the habit okay and so when

149
00:05:21,494 --> 00:05:23,820
when you're reading this book where bilbo

150
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,650
puts all right it's just kinda cool

151
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:26,880
where it's like ooh he's just like

152
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,560
oh nobody can see me and then

153
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,420
in the in the in the books

154
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,600
in the subsequent books the trilogy frodo

155
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,500
puts on the ring and it's like

156
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,350
is honourable fuckin change comes over him

157
00:05:37,364 --> 00:05:39,450
it's like this horrible nightmare world yeah

158
00:05:39,656 --> 00:05:42,030
it's like saying yes yeah but so

159
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:44,850
then i sort of understand that if

160
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:47,790
you're going to adapt the lord of

161
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:49,410
the rings first and you're like this

162
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:51,870
is such a huge success we'll go

163
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:54,210
back and do the hobbit but now

164
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:54,690
there's this

165
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,450
established world for people that maybe never

166
00:05:57,450 --> 00:05:59,580
read the books that it's like well

167
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:00,930
i see so they they added i

168
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:02,250
never saw these so they added the

169
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:04,440
darkness to the hobby yes they they're

170
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:06,270
anytime anyone put it put a ring

171
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:08,640
on put a ring on it um

172
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:11,430
they then saw the of the the

173
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:13,800
zombies or whatever there i honestly can't

174
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,850
remember what happens when

175
00:06:14,927 --> 00:06:16,260
puts the ring on the habit look

176
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:17,370
why in the ha why don't we

177
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:19,280
talk to the expert over here well

178
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,360
looking at it right now let's be

179
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,710
clear i will have mixed up all

180
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:24,720
of the movies into one mush sure

181
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:26,970
but there's what happens when frodo puts

182
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:29,400
on the ring is that he is

183
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,530
going into this kind of disturbing world

184
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,838
yeah everything is like black and white

185
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,080
like he's invisible but everything

186
00:06:35,174 --> 00:06:36,630
that isn't habana i think he can

187
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:37,740
like get away with stuff but like

188
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:39,060
they're still scary so it doesn't yeah

189
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:43,260
fun yeah but in the first cartoon

190
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:45,330
first cartoon is the only one that

191
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:47,310
i saw unliked i remember i remember

192
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:49,020
going like oh that's fun like this

193
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:51,060
is a fun thing yes a fun

194
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:53,910
story fine i don't like it yeah

195
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:55,200
it probably doesn't but i'm

196
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:56,760
coming to it as an adult i

197
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,870
think maybe as a kid i would

198
00:06:57,870 --> 00:06:59,220
have medicaid i was like oh what

199
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:00,995
a fun story like he falls in

200
00:07:00,995 --> 00:07:03,720
that and i'm paraphrasing the story obviously

201
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,760
i'm not reading this currently but he

202
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,900
falls in a hole and sees a

203
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,700
weirdo and then puts on a ring

204
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:11,580
the place was like every page of

205
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:14,700
j r r tolkien the hobbit stars

206
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,360
so he falls

207
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:16,860
in the holy see's a weirdo

208
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,850
huh and we watched the toyota it's

209
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:22,140
right by the way it starts with

210
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:24,420
that line so freaky slowing he flowed

211
00:07:25,471 --> 00:07:27,390
say ooh he's arguably yeah yeah so

212
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:29,040
he falls at all these weird i

213
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,870
actually think that is not a bad

214
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:33,241
opening line for a book so i

215
00:07:33,241 --> 00:07:34,920
agree the whole and caesar were down

216
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,540
so he falls all because you're wearing

217
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:38,610
my attention you're wondering who's he yes

218
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:40,590
are they midst versus is the narrator

219
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:42,480
telling a story in the real media

220
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:45,270
rez who knows yeah book that started

221
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:45,450
with

222
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:47,431
so so he falls in a hole

223
00:07:47,431 --> 00:07:49,046
and this is a weird concept to

224
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:50,790
weirdo it's not about i mean opening

225
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:52,110
lines and books are really hard and

226
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:53,130
i do a punch up on that

227
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:55,770
yeah anyway he falls an old season

228
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:58,350
anyway not bad i got a better

229
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:00,690
one okay i punched up yeah however

230
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:02,040
he falls in a hole and sees

231
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,750
a weirdo can i punch it up

232
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:05,760
yeah therefore he falls

233
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:06,750
in a hole and she's a weirdo

234
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:08,190
okay can i punch it up yeah

235
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:10,770
thusly he falls in a haunting weirdo

236
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,510
seems like you're just doing synonyms for

237
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:15,240
bunching up yeah moreover he falls in

238
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,860
a hole he's a weirdo moreover it's

239
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:17,850
such a word you would use it

240
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:19,590
a school paper like sound like you're

241
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:22,590
smart or yeah there was a rover

242
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:25,050
thus someone played me a tape and

243

i bet yeah funny

244
00:08:25,955 --> 00:08:27,448
it's going to be a teacher and

245
00:08:27,448 --> 00:08:28,800
your kid gives you like the student

246
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:30,660

yeah oh okay i am too that

312
00:10:53,985 --> 00:10:56,985

313
00:10:56,985 --> 00:10:59,055
wow oh my gosh a good tactic

314
00:10:59,235 --> 00:11:01,485
yeah and so it's a really good

315
00:11:01,485 --> 00:11:02,565
tactic if you're ever in it just

316
00:11:02,595 --> 00:11:03,465
cute to go like oh by the

317
00:11:03,465 --> 00:11:05,055
way i'm tape recording this conversation just

318
00:11:05,055 --> 00:11:07,035
for you know it really shows you

319
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:09,465
feel pretty confident you're right yeah yeah

320
00:11:09,705 --> 00:11:12,585
yeah yeah yeah but not to get

321
00:11:12,585 --> 00:11:14,835
into the vow yeah oh boy

322
00:11:15,585 --> 00:11:18,312
oh okay how's this already sleep talked

323
00:11:18,312 --> 00:11:20,145
about basically falling into a hole and

324
00:11:20,145 --> 00:11:22,214
seeing a weirdo yes exactly what happened

325
00:11:22,215 --> 00:11:23,865
those people hold i do kind of

326
00:11:23,865 --> 00:11:25,365
want to watch seduce wood on starz

327
00:11:25,365 --> 00:11:26,355
which i heard is the way better

328
00:11:26,355 --> 00:11:27,735
version of the vow which tells much

329
00:11:27,735 --> 00:11:28,815
more of the story but i'm also

330
00:11:28,815 --> 00:11:29,593
kind of like i don't really want

331
00:11:29,593 --> 00:11:30,675
to hear any more about this this

332
00:11:30,705 --> 00:11:32,595
this my girl this entire king are

333
00:11:32,595 --> 00:11:34,335
things i feel like i would much

334
00:11:34,335 --> 00:11:35,707
rather know that people

335
00:11:35,764 --> 00:11:37,845
talking about it than watching i wish

336
00:11:37,845 --> 00:11:39,285
i had watched tiger king i wish

337
00:11:39,285 --> 00:11:40,815
i could take that back yeah you

338
00:11:40,815 --> 00:11:43,095
can look man we were outside working

339
00:11:43,455 --> 00:11:45,045
outside the king and all his works

340
00:11:45,075 --> 00:11:47,055
and we were desperate for entertainment and

341
00:11:47,085 --> 00:11:48,765
normal work and it was right there

342
00:11:48,765 --> 00:11:49,815
and it was what i'm not gonna

343
00:11:49,815 --> 00:11:51,165
watch it what am i gonna watch

344
00:11:51,945 --> 00:11:53,895
but with the vow i sort of

345
00:11:53,895 --> 00:11:55,875
have this theory that because

346
00:11:55,875 --> 00:11:57,645
it came out if you've only watch

347
00:11:57,658 --> 00:11:59,025
the island it's only information you know

348
00:11:59,055 --> 00:12:00,405
it came out that there's way worse

349
00:12:00,405 --> 00:12:03,015
stuff even than that that this man

350
00:12:03,015 --> 00:12:04,845
has done a while now he's in

351
00:12:04,845 --> 00:12:07,485
jail for life and it's very deserved

352
00:12:07,725 --> 00:12:10,695
but in the in the show he's

353
00:12:10,695 --> 00:12:12,075
recorded all the time and he's had

354
00:12:12,075 --> 00:12:13,695
people recording all the times like they're

355
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:15,645
tape recording every conversation they have filming

356
00:12:15,645 --> 00:12:16,005
it so there's

357
00:12:16,065 --> 00:12:17,745
tons of footage of him just waxing

358
00:12:17,745 --> 00:12:19,635
poetic was fucking bullshit by the way

359
00:12:19,845 --> 00:12:21,735
i truly would be like you make

360
00:12:21,735 --> 00:12:23,085
no sense like there were so many

361
00:12:23,085 --> 00:12:24,764
times where someone could have easily still

362
00:12:24,765 --> 00:12:26,595
challenged anything he was saying because yeah

363
00:12:26,775 --> 00:12:27,825
but he claims to be the smartest

364
00:12:27,825 --> 00:12:29,385
person in the world like there's truly

365
00:12:29,385 --> 00:12:32,415
like he's delusional but it's good for

366
00:12:32,415 --> 00:12:34,275
a documentary though to constantly be recording

367
00:12:34,305 --> 00:12:36,195
wow but my point is that

368
00:12:36,705 --> 00:12:38,355
this should start doing this okay fine

369
00:12:38,475 --> 00:12:39,117
so we can we can talk a

370
00:12:39,135 --> 00:12:41,145
bit about this well honestly like i

371
00:12:41,865 --> 00:12:43,155
am at a point on the comedy

372
00:12:43,155 --> 00:12:44,565
bang bang tv shows like this would

373
00:12:44,715 --> 00:12:46,635
making the show would be really fast

374
00:12:46,635 --> 00:12:48,165
yeah we should i wish we could

375
00:12:48,165 --> 00:12:49,665
hire a crew to like follow us

376
00:12:49,665 --> 00:12:51,465
around while we make an episode or

377
00:12:51,465 --> 00:12:53,805
whatever ah to put it as an

378
00:12:53,805 --> 00:12:55,365
extra on one of the ways but

379
00:12:55,365 --> 00:12:56,265
like so

380
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:58,965
but then bruce springsteen is constantly recording

381
00:12:58,995 --> 00:13:01,755
every aspect of his amazing every album

382
00:13:01,755 --> 00:13:03,105
well i just watched his really good

383
00:13:03,105 --> 00:13:05,475
documentary letter to you about his new

384
00:13:05,475 --> 00:13:07,305
record it's like springs he's listening it

385
00:13:07,305 --> 00:13:09,105
was really good but but it seems

386
00:13:09,105 --> 00:13:11,475
like every album he's made the like

387
00:13:11,535 --> 00:13:13,215
a camera crew comes in and there's

388
00:13:13,215 --> 00:13:15,195
all this amazing food does feel like

389
00:13:15,405 --> 00:13:16,515
you know oh

390
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:17,774
from even the old day even the

391
00:13:17,774 --> 00:13:19,215
old days oh and you know and

392
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:20,895
it's like cheese should just get away

393
00:13:20,895 --> 00:13:22,755
i'm like yeah just anyway good well

394
00:13:22,755 --> 00:13:23,685
i just wanted to say that i

395
00:13:23,685 --> 00:13:25,155
felt like it might have been one

396
00:13:25,155 --> 00:13:28,095
of his manipulative tactics to record all

397
00:13:28,095 --> 00:13:30,315
of the possible stuff and be like

398
00:13:30,315 --> 00:13:32,025
i'm always on recording and then the

399
00:13:32,025 --> 00:13:34,815
second the cameras go off he's literally

400
00:13:35,205 --> 00:13:36,585
having sex with children

401
00:13:37,215 --> 00:13:39,675
it sound like doing more flying thing

402
00:13:39,705 --> 00:13:41,235
yeah oh um that

403
00:13:42,765 --> 00:13:45,195
that like it's as if he's kind

404
00:13:45,195 --> 00:13:45,915
of set it up to be like

405
00:13:45,915 --> 00:13:47,265
look i'm an open book i have

406
00:13:47,265 --> 00:13:48,915
a video of everything i've ever done

407
00:13:49,065 --> 00:13:50,205
and then of course there's this really

408
00:13:50,205 --> 00:13:52,905
dark backstory yeah why did where are

409
00:13:52,905 --> 00:13:54,795
the people who fell into it dumb

410
00:13:54,825 --> 00:13:56,625
like do they explain that my yeah

411
00:13:56,685 --> 00:13:58,635
you gotta watch this because like what

412
00:13:58,635 --> 00:14:00,675
what's your name from smallville alison she's

413
00:14:00,975 --> 00:14:02,595
off her rocker wow yeah

414
00:14:02,595 --> 00:14:03,735
yeah so it's just a bunch of

415
00:14:03,795 --> 00:14:06,075
really believes in the sun she's it's

416
00:14:06,375 --> 00:14:08,295
a couple lunatics in other words like

417
00:14:08,355 --> 00:14:09,855
like a lot of times you feel

418
00:14:09,855 --> 00:14:11,235
bad for people like oh they're not

419
00:14:11,235 --> 00:14:13,425
all lunatics or only they're all people

420
00:14:13,425 --> 00:14:14,685
who were in need of something until

421
00:14:14,685 --> 00:14:16,245
they were susceptible to cold which i

422
00:14:16,275 --> 00:14:17,775
i yeah i don't think that's like

423
00:14:17,955 --> 00:14:19,695
i'm a psionic or swing know but

424
00:14:19,695 --> 00:14:20,985
i'm saying they get to toe to

425
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:22,360
real there but for the grace of

426
00:14:22,575 --> 00:14:22,755
god

427
00:14:22,785 --> 00:14:25,245
so swept in and swept up in

428
00:14:25,245 --> 00:14:26,955
it that they don't realize it's weird

429
00:14:27,225 --> 00:14:28,125
but i think one of the things

430
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:29,175
that's weird about the vow is that

431
00:14:29,175 --> 00:14:31,125
by the time it is you know

432
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:33,165
they realize how messed up it was

433
00:14:33,165 --> 00:14:35,145
and all this stuff they still think

434
00:14:35,145 --> 00:14:37,725
the cult stuff was good like they're

435
00:14:37,725 --> 00:14:39,165
still kind of going like him with

436
00:14:39,165 --> 00:14:40,485
the teachings and like all the things

437
00:14:40,485 --> 00:14:42,465
we learned and like these my my

438
00:14:42,495 --> 00:14:42,915
show

439
00:14:42,915 --> 00:14:44,355
sashes and it's like no no no

440
00:14:44,415 --> 00:14:47,415
it was all that yes well connected

441
00:14:47,415 --> 00:14:49,065
to the bat yeah but if something

442
00:14:49,065 --> 00:14:51,705
makes someone feel better that part of

443
00:14:51,705 --> 00:14:53,385
it might be good i mean like

444
00:14:53,385 --> 00:14:55,725
you look at scientology like although we

445
00:14:55,725 --> 00:14:56,835
don't want to be talking about that

446
00:14:56,835 --> 00:14:58,965
probably on a recording i don't even

447
00:14:58,965 --> 00:15:00,945
know anything about it really i haven't

448
00:15:01,395 --> 00:15:02,925
really watched things or or

449
00:15:03,075 --> 00:15:05,655
for any religion mormonism or sure we're

450
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:07,785
having system early or like people who

451
00:15:07,785 --> 00:15:09,405
like you know like even like the

452
00:15:09,405 --> 00:15:11,235
long island medium where it's like if

453
00:15:11,235 --> 00:15:12,945
therapy think oh this makes me feel

454
00:15:12,945 --> 00:15:14,505
better but there is

455
00:15:15,675 --> 00:15:16,785
kind of a different thing than those

456
00:15:16,785 --> 00:15:18,315
things yeah although i will say that

457
00:15:18,465 --> 00:15:20,415
when in growing up i was thinking

458
00:15:20,415 --> 00:15:23,205
about this the other day that um

459
00:15:23,235 --> 00:15:26,685
my parents like didn't believe in therapy

460
00:15:26,715 --> 00:15:29,625
and so when it looked like someone

461
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:31,125
in my family needed it they were

462
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:33,705
like well only if it's a christian

463
00:15:33,705 --> 00:15:35,702
therapist what am

464
00:15:35,745 --> 00:15:38,205
and and it's just like ah but

465
00:15:38,205 --> 00:15:39,645
now i think they would be like

466
00:15:39,735 --> 00:15:41,655
it's such a different time than nineteen

467
00:15:41,655 --> 00:15:43,305
eighty five yeah i do think people

468
00:15:43,305 --> 00:15:44,775
nowadays i think people to be like

469
00:15:44,775 --> 00:15:45,735
oh yeah that's fine i think it's

470
00:15:45,735 --> 00:15:46,875
the same you don't think i think

471
00:15:46,875 --> 00:15:48,285
it's pretty much the same except for

472
00:15:48,285 --> 00:15:50,595
phones hey i think that's it the

473
00:15:50,595 --> 00:15:52,305
tvs are flatter you have to admit

474
00:15:52,305 --> 00:15:55,275
yeah nah my house anyway you have

475
00:15:55,335 --> 00:15:55,875
we are now

476
00:15:56,017 --> 00:16:00,465
around tv baby round the sphere why

477
00:16:00,465 --> 00:16:02,595
don't they make spherical tds so you

478
00:16:02,595 --> 00:16:03,915
can watch it from anywhere in your

479
00:16:03,915 --> 00:16:04,245
room

480
00:16:05,505 --> 00:16:06,915
that's what a flat one is

481
00:16:08,355 --> 00:16:09,735
okay why do you think the sphere

482
00:16:09,735 --> 00:16:12,225
is flat ma used to do the

483
00:16:12,255 --> 00:16:14,805
earth but um you could watch a

484
00:16:14,805 --> 00:16:16,635
flat tv from anywhere in the room

485
00:16:16,635 --> 00:16:19,961
scouts it introduce you to the mechanics

486
00:16:20,004 --> 00:16:23,295
running into walls so triumphantly he's arguing

487
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:25,515
that you can't see a flat screen

488
00:16:25,515 --> 00:16:26,936
tv from anywhere in the room where

489
00:16:26,985 --> 00:16:28,365
can see it from behind

490
00:16:29,085 --> 00:16:30,435
but you can find it from behind

491
00:16:30,435 --> 00:16:33,435
the wall a sphere you could i'm

492
00:16:33,435 --> 00:16:35,505
saying if you're like have you ever

493
00:16:35,505 --> 00:16:37,425
gone you're saying you hit a wall

494
00:16:37,425 --> 00:16:39,045
that the tv is on to do

495
00:16:39,045 --> 00:16:41,055
something and you can't sure but i

496
00:16:41,055 --> 00:16:43,575
mean it still say sure like archer

497
00:16:43,575 --> 00:16:46,125
who's lorne it's chore got close to

498
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:47,445
the wall you have to go up

499
00:16:47,445 --> 00:16:48,675
and do a thing i'm saying

500
00:16:48,675 --> 00:16:50,595
i'm twenty three so can't see what

501
00:16:50,595 --> 00:16:51,975
happened on the show and so you

502
00:16:51,975 --> 00:16:55,005
gotta shoot fears that are lowered like

503
00:16:55,005 --> 00:16:56,685
disco balls in the center of your

504
00:16:56,685 --> 00:16:59,265
room to squabbles just starting to scope

505
00:16:59,265 --> 00:17:00,675
when i make a p essay yeah

506
00:17:00,705 --> 00:17:02,985
please um actually it's about secretly recording

507
00:17:02,985 --> 00:17:04,515
people because i just saw this instagram

508
00:17:04,515 --> 00:17:05,325
please do it

509
00:17:07,095 --> 00:17:09,225
i thought was worth sharing the knowledge

510
00:17:09,225 --> 00:17:11,445
because this woman realised she's being filmed

511
00:17:11,445 --> 00:17:14,175
in her air bnb and the camera

512
00:17:14,205 --> 00:17:17,025
looked like a phone charger plug where

513
00:17:17,025 --> 00:17:19,305
you plug your usb into the wall

514
00:17:19,305 --> 00:17:21,435
and you see there's a little um

515
00:17:21,495 --> 00:17:24,243
microchip inside it dang and it's you

516
00:17:24,266 --> 00:17:26,505
i'm taking a little microchip that's redundant

517
00:17:26,595 --> 00:17:29,385
a teeny tiny little like their gigantic

518
00:17:29,385 --> 00:17:30,075
microchip

519
00:17:31,845 --> 00:17:33,525
but anyway you can tell if that

520
00:17:33,566 --> 00:17:34,893
is when because when you turn up

521
00:17:34,893 --> 00:17:36,705
over the the thing there's like a

522
00:17:36,705 --> 00:17:37,875
little hole for like i mean this

523
00:17:37,875 --> 00:17:38,955
is a friend of yours knows a

524
00:17:38,955 --> 00:17:40,125
woman i saw on instagram and everyone

525
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:42,825
was sharing it associate she was recording

526
00:17:42,825 --> 00:17:44,565
people know she was singing rbi and

527
00:17:44,565 --> 00:17:46,815
realized oh after all you know spending

528
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:47,865
a few days there oh my god

529
00:17:47,895 --> 00:17:49,935
she's being onboarded yeah the cops did

530
00:17:49,935 --> 00:17:51,315
nothing about it because she

531
00:17:51,315 --> 00:17:52,965
she's on that person's property and it's

532
00:17:52,965 --> 00:17:55,275
kind of like the laws are confuses

533
00:17:55,275 --> 00:17:56,745
things you can then that guy's air

534
00:17:56,745 --> 00:17:59,655
bnb was removed but that doesn't really

535
00:17:59,925 --> 00:18:03,525
resolve that it's crazy i mean these

536
00:18:03,525 --> 00:18:06,195
microchips are so small you gotta we

537
00:18:06,195 --> 00:18:07,485
gotta hit it or you gotta hit

538
00:18:07,485 --> 00:18:08,085
in your house

539
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:12,045
he's got em hidden everywhere have microchips

540
00:18:12,045 --> 00:18:13,485
gotten too small

541
00:18:14,835 --> 00:18:17,325
nine eleven you see the nine nine

542
00:18:17,325 --> 00:18:20,325
eleven gc that boston news report on

543
00:18:20,445 --> 00:18:23,205
on video game machines popping up everywhere

544
00:18:23,205 --> 00:18:24,885
in boston this is from nineteen eighty

545
00:18:24,885 --> 00:18:27,975
two i think and it was ah

546
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:30,165
i think i think dan rather it

547
00:18:30,165 --> 00:18:31,905
was national news it was a national

548
00:18:31,905 --> 00:18:32,985
story but it was set in boston

549
00:18:32,985 --> 00:18:34,545
like dan rather introduced it and it

550
00:18:34,545 --> 00:18:34,725
was

551
00:18:34,755 --> 00:18:39,075
like talking about how um there were

552
00:18:39,405 --> 00:18:40,725
i'm getting the math wrong but there

553
00:18:40,725 --> 00:18:43,425
are like a hundred thousand million one

554
00:18:43,425 --> 00:18:45,915
hundred thousand people in boston and there

555
00:18:45,915 --> 00:18:49,935
are forty thousand video game machines like

556
00:18:50,085 --> 00:18:52,335
like the the ratio was that doesn't

557
00:18:52,335 --> 00:18:54,044

558
00:18:54,044 --> 00:18:54,585
ratios

559
00:18:54,915 --> 00:18:57,435
they're everywhere and so they were introducing

560
00:18:57,435 --> 00:18:58,785
laws to get rid of them in

561
00:18:58,785 --> 00:19:01,155
certain properties and then these people's excuses

562
00:19:01,155 --> 00:19:04,155
were like you know old old women

563
00:19:04,155 --> 00:19:05,595

564
00:19:05,595 --> 00:19:07,425

are a waste of time or they're

579
00:19:32,985 --> 00:19:34,875
sapping people's brains it was always about

580
00:19:35,445 --> 00:19:37,905
the types of people who were congregating

581
00:19:37,905 --> 00:19:39,525
playing yeah the bus it's always about

582
00:19:39,525 --> 00:19:41,985
punk spikes every complaint in the city

583
00:19:41,985 --> 00:19:43,695

584
00:19:43,725 --> 00:19:44,355

is it prince charles charles he's in

593
00:20:02,775 --> 00:20:04,755
line but the the conventional wisdom is

594
00:20:04,755 --> 00:20:06,405
that he's going to refuse the throne

595
00:20:06,465 --> 00:20:07,575

596
00:20:07,695 --> 00:20:08,505

605
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:24,160

and touching a bowl full of little

672
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:54,190

684
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:20,260
great old parable it's a great old

685
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:22,210
pair you really should read it it's

686
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:24,820
so fun to g o p what

687
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,230
are you reading lauren you're on your

688
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:28,210
phone i was looking at elephant parable

689
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:30,730
oh the parable of the blind men

690
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:32,410
and an elephant originated okay so let's

691
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:33,760
see there's a cartoon and my breakdown

692
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,320
little faster okay an elephant

693
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,080
like the snake actually no it's a

694
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,210
tree stump what are you saying it's

695
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:43,060
like a sheath of leather you're all

696
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:44,590
wrong it's actually like a little furry

697
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:47,200
mouse is that the testicles so the

698
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,610
idea is if you're not seeing the

699
00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:49,570
whole thing you don't get the whole

700
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:52,300
picture yeah exactly like if you're only

701
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:54,340
yeah and also the listener line people

702
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:55,360

but wait

823
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:20,260
isn't that walter murphy's a fifth of

824
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:20,710
beethoven

825
00:28:21,790 --> 00:28:24,910
well it's beethoven yeah it's not the

826
00:28:24,910 --> 00:28:27,639
rewarding of walter murphy's okay beethoven if

827
00:28:27,639 --> 00:28:29,770
that makes it like he he took

828
00:28:29,770 --> 00:28:31,480
classical music and did i know what

829
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:31,900
he did

830
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:36,040
so i mean she paid for this

831
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,690
recording just like you know what i

832
00:28:37,690 --> 00:28:40,300
liked that sit the beethoven do that

833
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:41,507
well i don't even think it was

834
00:28:41,507 --> 00:28:44,770
a an aesthetic choice like larry david

835
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:46,840
doing the curb your enthusiasm thing where

836
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:47,920
it's like i like that piece of

837
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,660
music i think it's funny that's that's

838
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:51,754
a public domain i think those are

839
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:53,170
like rare like killer tracks

840
00:28:53,170 --> 00:28:55,060
ks the curb music is all like

841
00:28:56,050 --> 00:28:58,090
like you can just buy it online

842
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:01,270
why yeah yeah yeah yeah that's but

843
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:02,770
i think he just likes that i

844
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,030
think he liked that piece of music

845
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:05,170
because he was like that says what

846
00:29:05,170 --> 00:29:06,160
i want to say about the show

847
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:07,870
judge judy i think doesn't want to

848
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:10,900
pay a royalty every time her show

849
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,910
is on the air so she took

850
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:13,240
public

851
00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:15,700
domain music and paid someone like i

852
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:17,050
mean it's five hundred dollars to make

853
00:29:17,050 --> 00:29:18,760
that recording of it i mean so

854
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,590
it's was essentially walter murphy's fifth of

855
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:22,330
beethoven without the thing that walter murphy

856
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:25,120
added to it right yeah i think

857
00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:28,240
um attitudes f k throwing shay yes

858
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:31,090
had public domain yes tune because i

859
00:29:31,090 --> 00:29:32,466
was here at on other things every

860
00:29:32,466 --> 00:29:33,490
yeah so it was the thing

861
00:29:33,490 --> 00:29:35,290
i'm for the sloppy boys sketch show

862
00:29:35,410 --> 00:29:37,930
not always the birthday boys yeah my

863
00:29:37,930 --> 00:29:39,730
god and there's also something else though

864
00:29:39,730 --> 00:29:41,110
like even like an ad or something

865
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:42,190
that i heard i would happen to

866
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:43,870
us on the bang bang television show

867
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:46,030
where because because i was very involved

868
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:47,920
in the scoring of the thing like

869
00:29:48,610 --> 00:29:50,740
i and we would constantly be looking

870
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:52,270
for music tracks i'd go this one

871
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:53,650

872
00:29:53,650 --> 00:29:55,270
being sort of like this so i

873
00:29:55,270 --> 00:29:56,290
spent a lot of time on that

874
00:29:56,290 --> 00:29:57,700
i would get to know every track

875
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:59,050
that was used on everything and i

876
00:29:59,050 --> 00:30:01,840
would notice them pop up in of

877
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:04,150
in advertisements a lot and wow have

878
00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:06,310

baby always cried the same way out

886
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:24,610

00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:30,348
this this like little bit like wow

890
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:33,100
yeah and then i started if what

891
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:33,970

tiger

955
00:32:37,685 --> 00:32:39,035
you got deep into i did a

956
00:32:39,035 --> 00:32:42,425
show years ago with ah karen kilgour

957
00:32:42,425 --> 00:32:44,855
aref and eben schlyter called voice-overs the

958
00:32:44,855 --> 00:32:47,315
top which was alive show that we

959
00:32:47,315 --> 00:32:47,855
did

960
00:32:49,355 --> 00:32:50,555
we did it sort of thrilling adventure

961
00:32:50,555 --> 00:32:52,145
hour style but way before that show

962
00:32:52,145 --> 00:32:54,267
where we held the scripts we did

963
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:56,045
like a radio play and it was

964
00:32:56,045 --> 00:32:59,375
about a married um couple who were

965
00:32:59,375 --> 00:33:02,615
both ah voiceover artist and amateur detectives

966
00:33:03,485 --> 00:33:05,285
and so they use their voiceover skills

967
00:33:05,435 --> 00:33:07,745
to solve crimes but all the crimes

968
00:33:07,745 --> 00:33:09,185
were they were not they

969
00:33:10,115 --> 00:33:11,735
they were like these delusional people and

970
00:33:11,735 --> 00:33:15,035
they weren't real crimes um but we

971
00:33:15,065 --> 00:33:16,235
had a lot of sound effects that

972
00:33:16,235 --> 00:33:18,365
eben would play on on a laptop

973
00:33:19,055 --> 00:33:20,285
one of the sound effects was a

974
00:33:20,285 --> 00:33:24,605
door opening hey yes that i've heard

975
00:33:25,055 --> 00:33:29,045
in so many things so many rays

976
00:33:29,045 --> 00:33:29,345
honest

977
00:33:29,345 --> 00:33:31,025
really really annoying when you start to

978
00:33:31,025 --> 00:33:32,795
notice yes well and that's what i

979
00:33:32,795 --> 00:33:34,025
mean about the cry like it's not

980
00:33:34,025 --> 00:33:35,885
that i want to dive deep on

981
00:33:35,885 --> 00:33:37,805
this it's that i can't help it

982
00:33:37,805 --> 00:33:39,515
because when i hear it i feel

983
00:33:39,965 --> 00:33:42,455
cuckoo bananas because i know it's that

984
00:33:42,455 --> 00:33:44,555

a director like

989
00:33:49,535 --> 00:33:53,165
spielberg who essentially said hey we need

990
00:33:53,165 --> 00:33:56,855

991
00:33:56,855 --> 00:33:58,625

well i'm thinking of it a story

1034
00:35:47,225 --> 00:35:49,055
i wanted or a fact i wanted

1035
00:35:49,055 --> 00:35:50,645
to tell in our last episode when

1036
00:35:50,645 --> 00:35:52,055
we were talking about weddings and the

1037
00:35:52,055 --> 00:35:53,525
fact that how short it was right

1038
00:35:53,525 --> 00:35:54,575
after i see the thing that i

1039
00:35:54,575 --> 00:35:55,025
wanted to see

1040
00:35:55,025 --> 00:35:56,435
a oh no well i'm think you

1041
00:35:56,435 --> 00:35:57,695
wanna hear her run for never getting

1042
00:35:57,695 --> 00:35:58,775
married brought up the essure

1043
00:36:00,275 --> 00:36:01,625
i would have been long divorced if

1044
00:36:01,625 --> 00:36:03,665
i'd been married marriages an interesting psychological

1045
00:36:03,665 --> 00:36:04,925
thing if you need to feel bound

1046
00:36:04,925 --> 00:36:06,005
to someone that it's important to be

1047
00:36:06,005 --> 00:36:07,535
married if you have independent if you're

1048
00:36:07,535 --> 00:36:08,315
out of money in a sense of

1049
00:36:08,315 --> 00:36:10,835
independency like your independence there's something psychological

1050
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:12,035
about not being married because it gives

1051
00:36:12,035 --> 00:36:13,415
you the freedom to make decisions one

1052
00:36:13,415 --> 00:36:15,245
way or the other who dat that's

1053
00:36:15,245 --> 00:36:16,445
called the hot it's called associate got

1054
00:36:16,445 --> 00:36:18,514
married right she's married two times and

1055
00:36:18,545 --> 00:36:19,835
she married done for him

1056
00:36:20,075 --> 00:36:21,665
because of all those reasons but it

1057
00:36:21,665 --> 00:36:23,765
should be you know that's the reasons

1058
00:36:23,825 --> 00:36:26,735
for me totally know it sounds really

1059
00:36:26,735 --> 00:36:28,505
like the only people present things like

1060
00:36:28,505 --> 00:36:30,455
that where it's like they know everything

1061
00:36:30,455 --> 00:36:32,255
that their nose in other words shakira

1062
00:36:32,255 --> 00:36:34,295
shakira won't marry her longtime boyfriend here

1063
00:36:34,325 --> 00:36:36,455
shakira well okay well we're going to

1064
00:36:36,455 --> 00:36:39,185

1065
00:36:39,215 --> 00:36:39,545

00:37:08,975 --> 00:37:10,985
of this truck and he's got a

1080
00:37:10,985 --> 00:37:12,575
knife i think it's a fucking butter

1081
00:37:12,575 --> 00:37:13,505
knife that's not a knife

1082
00:37:14,795 --> 00:37:15,125
this is

1083
00:37:17,555 --> 00:37:21,095
so you talking to me he you

1084
00:37:21,185 --> 00:37:22,685
talking to me

1085
00:37:23,825 --> 00:37:24,005
e

1086
00:37:27,521 --> 00:37:29,615
one buddy drops the knife on the

1087
00:37:29,615 --> 00:37:31,925
floor of the cab the truck cab

1088
00:37:33,425 --> 00:37:36,935
the noise is so loud it's just

1089
00:37:36,935 --> 00:37:38,015
a butter knife that drops on a

1090
00:37:38,045 --> 00:37:40,715
carpeted car carpet did but instead is

1091
00:37:40,715 --> 00:37:42,995
like clang i dunno it's so fucking

1092
00:37:42,995 --> 00:37:44,705
loud like you expect the driver of

1093
00:37:44,705 --> 00:37:47,135
the cabinet what what is my cab

1094
00:37:47,135 --> 00:37:49,835
mike was doing it like like secretly

1095
00:37:50,495 --> 00:37:52,115
he accidentally dropped the knife and supposed

1096
00:37:52,115 --> 00:37:53,078
to be a tense moment like oh

1097
00:37:53,105 --> 00:37:54,425
oh you dropped the knife but the

1098
00:37:54,425 --> 00:37:55,655
noise is so loud you think the

1099
00:37:55,655 --> 00:37:57,425
tense moment is well surely that guy

1100
00:37:57,425 --> 00:37:59,375
heard that yeah it's fucking right it

1101
00:37:59,375 --> 00:38:01,985
was like reverberating throughout this truck i

1102
00:38:01,985 --> 00:38:04,595
think like the sound people go overboard

1103
00:38:04,595 --> 00:38:06,095

when i was a kid

1306
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:11,650
i feel like i lied a lot

1307
00:45:11,740 --> 00:45:12,520
i like it a lot as a

1308
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:13,360
little kid but i feel like i

1310
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:18,820

yeah but i don't need to argue

1314
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:26,380
it i don't carefully so when i

1315
00:45:26,410 --> 00:45:27,580
think back to myself lying as a

1316
00:45:27,580 --> 00:45:29,230
kid i'm like i probably probably everyone

1317
00:45:29,230 --> 00:45:29,980

i was mortified so more because oh

1416
00:48:54,850 --> 00:48:56,411
we've all done it and it was

1417
00:48:56,530 --> 00:48:58,330
just of little book i just talked

1418
00:48:58,330 --> 00:49:00,190
about on our youtube show about writing

1419
00:49:00,190 --> 00:49:02,830
poems and and stealing verses i heard

1420
00:49:02,830 --> 00:49:03,580
him cop to that

1421
00:49:03,790 --> 00:49:05,620
yeah while isn't funny what like as

1422
00:49:05,620 --> 00:49:07,869
a teen yeah to like women he

1423
00:49:07,869 --> 00:49:08,980

1424
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:11,530
gosh you're so you know incredible but

1425
00:49:11,530 --> 00:49:12,790
one of the songs that he did

1426
00:49:12,790 --> 00:49:15,100
that with was very strange oh yeah

1427
00:49:15,100 --> 00:49:16,420
it was song lyrics and he said

1428
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:17,920
they were poems yeah and then i

1429
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:19,720
found it very odd that somebody would

1430
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:21,100
read that it was like a weird

1431
00:49:21,130 --> 00:49:23,350
song same effect by just saying like

1432
00:49:23,740 --> 00:49:25,210

1433
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:26,710
oh my god eggs i wanna be

1434
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:28,540
yes that would be like was i

1435
00:49:28,540 --> 00:49:31,362
remember these two people in drama who

1436
00:49:31,362 --> 00:49:33,100
were dating and he wrote out the

1437
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:34,450
ah or no she did it she

1438
00:49:34,450 --> 00:49:37,150
wrote the smiths lyrics ah it's not

00:49:37,150 --> 00:49:38,500
like any other love this one is

1440
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:41,140
different because it's us and and wrote

1441
00:49:41,140 --> 00:49:43,060
it and like presented it to him

1442
00:49:43,060 --> 00:49:43,900
and by the way he was

1443
00:49:43,930 --> 00:49:46,480
secretly gay and awe and dating this

1444
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:48,640
woman as a cover and she liked

1445
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:49,900
him more than you know it was

1498
00:51:32,770 --> 00:51:33,970
think there's times your parent

1499
00:51:34,009 --> 00:51:35,500
like are letting you get away with

1500
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:37,660
it like when they're one hundred percent

00:51:37,750 --> 00:51:40,930

1502
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:42,370

00:51:45,100 --> 00:51:46,240

envy your yours anger there's something kind

1509
00:51:57,250 --> 00:51:59,350
of like nice about the idea that

1510
00:51:59,350 --> 00:52:01,240
your mom probably would not be the

1511
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:02,920
case with her but if she kinda

1512
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:04,030
was like i feel like there's something

1513
00:52:04,210 --> 00:52:05,920
secret right there well lemme lemme have

1514
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:07,210

1515
00:52:07,210 --> 00:52:07,358
were

1516
00:52:07,570 --> 00:52:08,486
they were the type of people who

1517
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:10,180
are like searching my room when i

1518
00:52:10,180 --> 00:52:12,430
went to camp suisse you know like

1519
00:52:12,430 --> 00:52:14,020
i remember you expect that to happen

1520
00:52:14,020 --> 00:52:15,370
and you hid stuff for life here's

1521
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:17,020
oh here's one that was terrible like

1522
00:52:17,050 --> 00:52:18,580
oh no that said fuck you snoop

1523
00:52:19,870 --> 00:52:21,940
i love that my mother would put

1524
00:52:21,940 --> 00:52:22,780
notes like that in his drawer because

1525
00:52:22,780 --> 00:52:24,070
i always would go in his drawers

1526
00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:26,698
no yeah and then i i mean

1527
00:52:26,890 --> 00:52:27,790
he would put one that was like

1528
00:52:27,910 --> 00:52:29,800
get out of this drawer or something

1529
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:31,630
but then i love it get out

1530
00:52:31,630 --> 00:52:33,100
of this room one time i found

1531
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:35,380
that i love just like what we

1532
00:52:35,380 --> 00:52:37,960
lived high times when your socks away

1533
00:52:40,450 --> 00:52:41,860
but i remember i went to ah

1534
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:43,330
okay so the first time i ever

1535
00:52:43,330 --> 00:52:45,250
drank alcohol i drink at my friend's

1536
00:52:45,250 --> 00:52:47,500
house like a shot and i was

1537
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:48,790
like yeah this is horrible

1538
00:52:49,540 --> 00:52:50,860
and but then i went to a

1539
00:52:50,860 --> 00:52:52,990
party when i was fourteen where we

1540
00:52:52,990 --> 00:52:55,210
had it must have been wine coolers

1541
00:52:55,300 --> 00:52:57,190
and i got drunk and i was

1542
00:52:57,190 --> 00:52:58,480
like oh this is okay maybe it

1543
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:01,120
was fifteen sven i was like i

1544
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:03,640
want to experiment with this so i

1545
00:53:03,850 --> 00:53:06,130
i hung out outside the grocery store

1546
00:53:06,130 --> 00:53:07,810
and i asked a guy like an

1547
00:53:07,810 --> 00:53:09,430
older guy hey do you mind buying

1548
00:53:09,430 --> 00:53:09,490
me

1549
00:53:09,490 --> 00:53:11,200
me a thing of wine coolers old

1550
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:12,700
thing you know and here's the money

1551
00:53:13,090 --> 00:53:15,310
and two people said no go away

1552
00:53:15,310 --> 00:53:16,420
and then the third was like yeah

1553
00:53:16,450 --> 00:53:18,332
sure fine and i hung out outside

1554
00:53:18,343 --> 00:53:19,570
he bought me a six pack of

1555
00:53:19,570 --> 00:53:21,580
wine coolers bottles and james i remember

1556
00:53:22,150 --> 00:53:24,130
and i went back to my room

1557
00:53:24,130 --> 00:53:25,990
and drank them to kind of like

1558
00:53:25,990 --> 00:53:28,870
try to feel the effects of completion

1559
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:33,040
i know this story and so but

1560
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:34,870
then i i and and i couldn't

1561
00:53:34,870 --> 00:53:37,000
even drink all six the same day

1562
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,800
or whenever i think i drank two

1563
00:53:38,860 --> 00:53:39,850
at a time i was like do

1564
00:53:39,850 --> 00:53:41,350
i feel drunk and my feet like

1565
00:53:41,380 --> 00:53:42,880
trying to figure it out but i

1566
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:45,070
couldn't get rid of the the bottles

1567
00:53:45,940 --> 00:53:48,790
because my parents would have seen them

1568
00:53:48,790 --> 00:53:49,780
when they took the garbage

1569
00:53:49,810 --> 00:53:50,920
cans out or whatever so i was

1570
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:52,150
like alright i'm gonna i'll put these

1571
00:53:52,150 --> 00:53:53,110
in like i'll leave these in my

1572
00:53:53,110 --> 00:53:54,670
closet and i'll think of them another

1573
00:53:54,670 --> 00:53:56,080
day i'll try to figure out the

1574
00:53:56,080 --> 00:53:57,910
solution another day why not think of

1575
00:53:57,910 --> 00:53:59,740
them another well also i couldn't sneak

1576
00:53:59,740 --> 00:54:01,750
them out anywhere because my parents are

1577
00:54:01,750 --> 00:54:03,850
always looking at me kid logic like

1578
00:54:03,850 --> 00:54:05,620
i'll just put that in here and

1579
00:54:05,620 --> 00:54:07,360
eventually that'll go there's probably a bomb

1580
00:54:07,361 --> 00:54:09,490
in your shirt probably sometime through a

1581
00:54:09,490 --> 00:54:09,886
sandwich

1582
00:54:09,970 --> 00:54:11,950
i wanna eat in my closet and

1583
00:54:12,310 --> 00:54:14,290
i found it it was just green

1584
00:54:14,410 --> 00:54:16,900
why remember my brother hid his bong

1585
00:54:17,470 --> 00:54:20,950
in the garage in a place in

1586
00:54:20,950 --> 00:54:23,860
the garage the other bongs yes specifically

1587
00:54:23,860 --> 00:54:25,210
ciders yeah

1588
00:54:27,010 --> 00:54:28,270
no but i but that was that

1589
00:54:28,270 --> 00:54:29,320
was a way to do it of

1590
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:30,670
like don't keep anything in your room

1591
00:54:30,670 --> 00:54:32,645
because my parents would search the rooms

1592
00:54:32,645 --> 00:54:34,240
so it's like he kept his bong

1593
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:37,030
in the garage somewhere but there were

1594
00:54:37,030 --> 00:54:39,460
probably a million ways around this problem

1595
00:54:39,460 --> 00:54:40,720
that i wasn't thinking of but i

1596
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:42,040
just put them in and then i

1597
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:43,600
went to summer camp and then in

1598
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:44,710
the middle of summer camp i was

1599
00:54:44,710 --> 00:54:46,030
there for a week i all of

1600
00:54:46,030 --> 00:54:46,450
a sudden we

1601
00:54:46,450 --> 00:54:48,670
and oh fuck they're gonna search my

1602
00:54:48,670 --> 00:54:50,920
room my bed while i'm gone i

1603
00:54:50,922 --> 00:54:55,060
have those six bottles there and sure

1604
00:54:55,060 --> 00:54:56,530
enough like the minute i went back

1605
00:54:56,530 --> 00:54:58,510
i was looking for clues on their

1606
00:54:58,510 --> 00:55:00,580
faces they picked me up and they

1607
00:55:00,580 --> 00:55:01,840
were like okay we're gonna talk to

1608
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:04,120
you by the way and oh my

1609
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:05,980
god it's just a mun yeah just

1610
00:55:05,980 --> 00:55:06,610
another lie

1611
00:55:06,610 --> 00:55:10,330
eg huge long six hour conversation of

1612
00:55:10,330 --> 00:55:12,670
like am i an alcoholic am i

1613
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:14,440

i

1622
00:55:26,770 --> 00:55:29,080
try to walk inside it's just oh

1623
00:55:29,110 --> 00:55:30,940
so many of those types of ah

1624
00:55:31,750 --> 00:55:35,080
horrible conversations with my parents well i

1625
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:36,100
think i've told you this one but

1626
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:37,150
when my friend and i had a

1627
00:55:37,150 --> 00:55:38,620
party secretly when her dad went out

1628
00:55:38,620 --> 00:55:40,540
of town and then it was really

1629
00:55:40,540 --> 00:55:42,670
fun and this was in high school

1630
00:55:42,850 --> 00:55:43,870
and we threw all the stuff way

1631
00:55:43,870 --> 00:55:46,420
like four houses down in the towers

1632
00:55:46,420 --> 00:55:46,720
down

1633
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:50,140
and then like the person who lived

1634
00:55:50,140 --> 00:55:52,450
there saw the receipt from domino's and

1635
00:55:52,450 --> 00:55:54,700

00:55:54,730 --> 00:55:57,040
what a fuckin so like you nar

00:55:57,070 --> 00:56:00,640

i definitely wouldn't be thinking i'm going

1645
00:56:13,510 --> 00:56:14,680
