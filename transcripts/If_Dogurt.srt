terrified yeah because it would be too

302
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:14,880

354
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:56,060
on the freeway rear end into somebody

355
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:57,980
else like oof really hard and then

356
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:59,840
that person quickly got into the lane

357
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,190
that we were in trying to get

358
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:03,110
a winning ram and someone else right

359
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:05,120
yeah and then we almost hit them

360
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:06,980
move and then mike like just kept

361
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:08,690
going and then ah and got us

362
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:09,500

yeah you guessed like because we want

369
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:20,780
we could if he had been like

370
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:22,520
a second delay yeah we could have

371
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:24,200
really gotten no bad accident as well

gonna shoot uber you better be good

397
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:19,910
i do think that the self-driving cars

398
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:20,960
i look forward to that because i

399
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,100
think i think a lot of this

400
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,440
will you know my theory occurring you

401
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,880
know my theory i don't know you're

402
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:28,640
it's gotta be everything at the same

403
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:31,580
time yeah meaning every car selter every

404
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:33,260
you can have you know like with

405
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:34,220
bathrooms it's

406
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:38,540
like what batch row zoo automatic water

407
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:41,810
and soap and paper towel yeah otherwise

408
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,640
i sit there with my hand underneath

409
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:47,120
the spray think that automatic soap and

410
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,510
water is helpful is it actually saving

411
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:52,010
i increase it if they did it

412
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:53,480
for the water definitely for this i

413
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,380
wonder should i tell

414
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:57,050
you because i people behave it on

415
00:13:57,050 --> 00:13:58,280
and walk out of the tech i

416
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:00,410
i would take those things i hate

417
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:01,910
them and i i was talking with

418
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:03,290
a friend of mine once and and

419
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:04,460
saying like i wish i could just

420
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:05,900
have regular faucets that i could turn

421
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,520
yeah obviously but you know somebody's just

422
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,560
gonna leave that running and i was

423
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,480
like i can't imagine that people why

424
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,250
would people do i guess to a

425
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:14,540
month later i went into

426
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:16,098
like an airport bathroom or something and

427
00:14:16,098 --> 00:14:18,200
a guy had just left and walked

428
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:21,470
away yeah it's ridiculous my dog in

429
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:23,900
the world like you turn it off

430
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:27,290
so weird but people are stupid thing

431
00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:28,850
like a thing of hard drives me

432
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,340
crazy as people spitting gum into urinals

433
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:34,220
oh people do it all the fuck

434
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:34,490
not

435
00:14:34,723 --> 00:14:36,380
anywhere it's not good it's just gonna

436
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:37,880
sit there yes for someone to have

437
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:40,792
your scrape off right here a gumtree

438
00:14:40,792 --> 00:14:41,960
will grow out of the euro that

439
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,370
makes them like san luis obispo and

440
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:44,930
there's nothing grosser than the idea of

441
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:47,780
of gum alley gum being pissed on

442
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,490
gum in general is weird

443
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,280
i love gum you love gum i

444
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:53,510
someone gave me some gum i think

445
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:54,320
it might have been you the other

446
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,370
day and yes i put it in

447
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:56,540
my mouth and i was like what

448
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:58,850
is the purpose of this dude it's

449
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:02,150
taste good i like to chew and

450
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:03,320
it smells i like to

451
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,220
that i guess yeah maybe i don't

452
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:08,090
like to chew and that's why i

453
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:09,530
don't like yeah it just feels like

454
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:11,750
the flavor is very fleeting yeah i

455
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:13,430
like your loved one and you're going

456
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:15,650
wrong some people think it looks really

457
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:17,180
stupid to chew gum but it feels

458
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:20,120
like a con that the wrigley family

459
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,250
has inflicted upon us like hey this

460
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:23,120
is a thing we all like to

461
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,620
do and suddenly gum is everyway

462
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:26,210
there you go into the airports and

463
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:27,020

stone

491
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:19,820
um i guess what's the magazine named

492
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:22,010
after the band no i think it

493
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:24,860
was named after the dylan song i

494
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:27,650
lacked a role in stowe either way

495
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,290
dumb either way yeah call it rock

496
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:32,720
magazine oh is that why because it's

497
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,260
raw rolling rock beer you remember when

498
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:37,280
they debating me

499
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,290
maybe your magazine years ago when that

500
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:42,498
magazine she bangs comes out what because

501
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,510
ricky martin was so popular oh no

502
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:47,900
shit banking magazine is still very journalistically

503
00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:49,940
oh i think one could argue that

504
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:51,500
the impact of the bob dylan had

505
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,510
on the culture is perhaps a little

506
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:55,700
more significant than ricky martin pe yeah

507
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:57,470
wow culture why didn't they

508
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,210
name it blowing in the wind magazine

509
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,800
that's a good point see there you

510
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,450
have a point how about raised twenty

511
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:04,550
les mec there i totally agree with

512
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:06,260
you i would prefer lay lady lay

513
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:09,198
i saw this funny onion magazine was

514
00:17:09,198 --> 00:17:11,330
like the onion but just twenty i

515
00:17:11,334 --> 00:17:12,920
said hey i think i'll be fair

516
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:15,200
it was a weird cheap um and

517
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,850
it said it was bob dylan on

518
00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:17,660
the cover and it was like

519
00:17:17,690 --> 00:17:20,150
bob dylan on how he likes his

520
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:22,490
corn and why he lies so it

521
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:24,980
was like that's somebody and that somebody

522
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:27,290
commented it's even funnier because it's like

523
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:29,150
implies that he was more he would

524
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:30,080
sit down with you to talk about

525
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,370
corn but he wouldn't go accept his

526
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:34,460
nobel prize or whatever he won and

527
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:35,570

530
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:38,990
know why he likes his going

531
00:17:40,311 --> 00:17:42,110
really i yeah i can't imagine anyone

532
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:46,730
being that important to people anymore do

533
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:47,930
you know what i mean like everyone

00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:49,520
knows everyone can on the same page

535
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,410
with everyone's just like bob dylan is

536
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:53,450
it speaks for all of us at

537
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:55,400
who are this age between you know

bob dylan you don't think is the

541
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:00,290
same

542
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:01,490
case with billie eilish

543
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:03,950
you know there but see this is

544
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:06,950
the thing it's like generationally probably there

545
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:08,360
are those people who are younger than

546
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:10,250
we just don't care oh yeah like

547
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:10,790
candy pie

548
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:13,580
well like bob dylan was that but

549
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:16,369
everyone was like younger and like well

550
00:18:16,369 --> 00:18:17,811
yeah well also there was less there

551
00:18:17,811 --> 00:18:19,730
were less newspapers and stuff so everyone

552
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:21,156
could just agree on something yeah they

553
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:22,850
read and be told what they should

554
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:23,870
there were only ten newspapers they were

555
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:25,430
only ten musical artists and was one

yeah i like the way they work

932
00:31:28,125 --> 00:31:32,835
it no diggity spoons were invented because

933
00:31:32,835 --> 00:31:35,415
of days spoons were invented because those

934
00:31:35,417 --> 00:31:37,785
were invented because of dates so that's

935
00:31:37,785 --> 00:31:39,435
it because of dates because you don't

936
00:31:39,435 --> 00:31:41,205
want to look like a slob just

937
00:31:41,205 --> 00:31:43,245

it at a certain date checks at

950
00:32:08,205 --> 00:32:09,165
a restaurant

everyone is a king and we're doing

963
00:32:35,865 --> 00:32:37,965
a co kingship well i think they

964
00:32:37,965 --> 00:32:39,915
not they nominate someone to actually be

965
00:32:39,915 --> 00:32:41,805
the king okay so but everyone's wearing

966
00:32:41,805 --> 00:32:43,815
crowns yeah can you wear a crown

967
00:32:43,815 --> 00:32:45,495
if you're not a king yeah she's

968
00:32:45,495 --> 00:32:46,515
been the burger king

969
00:32:48,015 --> 00:32:50,565
have you scam you got me because

970
00:32:50,565 --> 00:32:52,935
yeah you can yeah i assume you're

971
00:32:52,935 --> 00:32:53,505
a burger king

972
00:32:55,185 --> 00:32:56,265
one of the main areas when's the

973
00:32:56,265 --> 00:32:57,375
next time you'll be a burger king

974
00:32:58,125 --> 00:33:00,225
unforeseeable i think the last time was

975
00:33:00,225 --> 00:33:01,995
a burger king okay magic april

976
00:33:03,135 --> 00:33:06,465
better i'll tell you thousand ten and

977
00:33:06,465 --> 00:33:07,575
i know this but i didn't know

978
00:33:07,575 --> 00:33:09,735
this remember where was eating it i

979
00:33:09,735 --> 00:33:10,905
was eating my apartment that i lived

980
00:33:10,905 --> 00:33:12,915
in at that time and i got

981
00:33:13,065 --> 00:33:14,865
stomach pains that felt like i was

982
00:33:14,865 --> 00:33:17,865
being chopped with a knife yeah and

983
00:33:17,865 --> 00:33:19,785
so i decided that was it that

984
00:33:19,785 --> 00:33:21,525
was it for burger king really it's

985
00:33:21,555 --> 00:33:23,115
strange how and it made

986
00:33:23,205 --> 00:33:24,825
it probably doesn't have anything to do

987
00:33:24,825 --> 00:33:26,325
with the burger king that's the other

988
00:33:26,325 --> 00:33:27,841
thing i'd probably probably do with it

989
00:33:27,945 --> 00:33:30,795
oh you usually was directly pro know

990
00:33:30,885 --> 00:33:33,165

1029
00:34:50,835 --> 00:34:52,755

1035
00:35:03,075 --> 00:35:05,145
about that my cousin for christmas had

00:35:18,165 --> 00:35:20,325
those jam and jelly jars are just

1044
00:35:20,325 --> 00:35:22,245

a pasta good plan king remember that

1293
00:43:26,555 --> 00:43:27,245
from sesame street

1294
00:43:29,645 --> 00:43:31,415
there is a bit that that as

1295
00:43:31,445 --> 00:43:33,185
i guess it's like carl tart it

1296
00:43:33,185 --> 00:43:34,055
taught you

1297
00:43:35,195 --> 00:43:37,745
ah well it's very rare that

1298
00:43:38,765 --> 00:43:41,465
oh that there is there was a

1299
00:43:41,525 --> 00:43:44,135
a bit on sesame street that taught

1300
00:43:44,135 --> 00:43:46,415
you i guess basically how to organize

1301
00:43:46,535 --> 00:43:49,235
things oh because the kin says whatever

1302
00:43:49,235 --> 00:43:50,795
sparks joy the king wanted to have

1303
00:43:50,795 --> 00:43:53,225
a big ah party like a picnic

1304
00:43:53,255 --> 00:43:55,955
for the kingdom sure and benevolent king

1305
00:43:55,955 --> 00:43:57,845
people didn't use as most kings this

1306
00:43:57,845 --> 00:43:58,145
guy was

1307
00:43:58,145 --> 00:44:01,505
the benevolent and he um was telling

1308
00:44:01,505 --> 00:44:04,145
everybody yeah everybody brings something and these

1309
00:44:04,145 --> 00:44:05,255
dumb dumps were like what do we

1310
00:44:05,255 --> 00:44:06,455
bring he's like you know stuff like

1311
00:44:06,665 --> 00:44:08,975
potato salad so then everybody brought potato

1312
00:44:08,975 --> 00:44:12,935
salad oh okay like no no no

1313
00:44:12,935 --> 00:44:14,375
you can't just all bring potato salad

1314
00:44:14,405 --> 00:44:16,535
bring stuff like watermelon to then everyone

1315
00:44:16,535 --> 00:44:18,305
brings whites right oh then

1316
00:44:18,335 --> 00:44:20,375
somebody has to tell a king look

1317
00:44:20,765 --> 00:44:22,055
you gotta fuckin break it down for

1318
00:44:22,055 --> 00:44:24,335
these people yeah so then does he

1319
00:44:24,335 --> 00:44:26,525
list every single thing yes he says

1320
00:44:26,555 --> 00:44:27,845
he points to people and says you

1321
00:44:27,845 --> 00:44:29,825
bring a watermelon good plan king they'll

1322
00:44:29,825 --> 00:44:31,655
say oh i like that and the

1323
00:44:31,655 --> 00:44:33,935
idea was ah this is you have

1324
00:44:33,935 --> 00:44:35,195
to make a plan and then things

1325
00:44:35,195 --> 00:44:36,545
will go smoother so the moral of

1326
00:44:36,545 --> 00:44:38,465
this is not don't just

1327
00:44:38,495 --> 00:44:41,675
khao tao to whoever's in charge obsequious

1328
00:44:41,675 --> 00:44:43,355
know very much them there it is

1329
00:44:43,355 --> 00:44:45,245
very much you have to try to

1330
00:44:45,245 --> 00:44:47,104
please oh you have to trend and

1331
00:44:47,105 --> 00:44:49,355
to degree so just listen to plans

1332
00:44:49,355 --> 00:44:51,455
that your masters make for you and

1333
00:44:51,455 --> 00:44:52,565
do whatever they tell you tell you

1334
00:44:52,565 --> 00:44:54,215
something if here's dumb as these peasants

1335
00:44:54,695 --> 00:44:56,045
that is what you should do does

1336
00:44:56,045 --> 00:44:58,085
a good point wouldn't it be fun

1337
00:44:58,085 --> 00:44:58,625
to be on tests

1338
00:44:58,625 --> 00:45:00,365

1339
00:45:00,365 --> 00:45:02,525

to be alone on this but i

1342
00:45:06,395 --> 00:45:07,595

he just needs to get her bangs

1503
00:50:50,585 --> 00:50:52,445

like ever some some

1505
00:50:54,286 --> 00:50:55,540

was virtually yeah it's like blunt bangs

1507
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:00,250
yeah just like barely just like you

1508
00:51:00,250 --> 00:51:03,130

00:51:03,130 --> 00:51:05,320
just covering the hairline yeah exactly exactly

1510
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:08,380

1605
00:54:31,570 --> 00:54:33,070
them tonight for two my guess i

1606
00:54:33,070 --> 00:54:36,640
wanted to get them well ideally tomorrow's

1607
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:38,080
they'd be fresher your i could pick

1608
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:38,980
them up like i thought i could

1609
00:54:38,980 --> 00:54:40,120
place the order now and then get

1610
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:42,310
the flowers to howard but ah how

1611
00:54:42,310 --> 00:54:44,560
would the day afterward for you well

1612
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:46,090
not great because that's the day

1613
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:47,470
after the interval and i can't do

1614
00:54:47,470 --> 00:54:49,660
this i get what i don't what

1615
00:54:49,660 --> 00:54:51,070
did i just say the day we

1616
00:54:51,070 --> 00:54:52,810
suggested isn't going to work for you

1617
00:54:52,900 --> 00:54:55,150
because it's the day after the anniversary

1618
00:54:55,150 --> 00:54:57,370
yeah that's your take hold on although

1619
00:54:57,370 --> 00:54:58,450
i think i think we're okay i

1620
00:54:58,450 --> 00:55:00,160
think we can figure out a solution

1621
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:01,900
here i think what we could do

1622
00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:03,580
is give you flowers the day after

1623
00:55:03,580 --> 00:55:05,740
your anniversary but maybe call your wife

1624
00:55:06,070 --> 00:55:06,250
and

1625
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:08,140
say hey he placed an order he

1626
00:55:08,140 --> 00:55:09,400
just came in a little too late

1627
00:55:09,430 --> 00:55:12,340

probably push some stuff around but the

1661
00:56:19,450 --> 00:56:20,770
