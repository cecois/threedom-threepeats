you get doing okay run up and

12
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,740
do you remember when bottled water became

13
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:40,227
a thing yes i do because of

14
00:00:40,227 --> 00:00:41,970
this and i was like i remember

15
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:44,070
it being fancy like there was evian

16
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:45,600
and then i remember now everybody has

17
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,670
it would you you were older than

18
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:49,770
me so what was that experience when

19
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:51,570
bottled water was like hey now you

20
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:52,560
need this and you have to

21
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:55,290
by the first thing that happened was

22
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:58,140
perrier and that was a big punchline

23
00:00:58,350 --> 00:00:59,850
even though it was sparkling right like

24
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:01,020
what are you going to bathe in

25
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,060
perrier it's like so it's the bank

26
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:05,910
robbers bad show yeah it's like it's

27
00:01:05,910 --> 00:01:09,030
water you're buying yeah but it was

28
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:11,340
because the idea was it was designer

29
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:11,790
water

30
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:15,060
then when bottle water came out it

31
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:16,800
was because i was i was starting

32
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,290
standup at that time like late eighties

33
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:22,800
it was a huge punchline yeah everybody

34
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,570
had a bottled water bit about how

35
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:28,200
ridiculous it was and then channa lindy

36
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,780
you guys well know what you mean

37
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:32,610
in the study they turned up the

38
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:32,880
terror

39
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,050
well ideal i don't but at the

40
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:35,430
time there was a lot of problems

41
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:37,950
with fucking water and just how but

42
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:39,810
were they just what were the problems

43
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:43,200
it depends on the city pigs read

44
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:45,540
read an article about how in los

45
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:48,660
angeles ah there is a campaign to

46
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:52,860
try to ah teach the citizens especially

47
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,740
people in lower income areas that the

48
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,530
water here is actually safe yeah from

49
00:01:58,530 --> 00:01:59,790
the taps and it's not going to

50
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:01,200
kill you yeah because

51
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,640
because people are spending a lot of

52
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,470
money going out and getting bottled water

53
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:06,000
that they don't need when in l

54
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,890
a it's like it it's fine you

55
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:09,480
can it's not like maybe the country

56
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:11,426
that you came here from where the

57
00:02:11,426 --> 00:02:13,290
the water is not safe the water

58
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:14,370
here is safe and you can you

59
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:15,510
don't have to spend all your money

60
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:16,920
on bottled water although when i moved

61
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,290
here i was told you know the

62
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,360
water is not good to drink railing

63
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:22,950
the town i thought that too because

64
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:24,930
i i was so in chicago it's

65
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:26,250
good and in new york it was

66
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:30,240
supposedly really make me suh dad and

67
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,890
i know when i move wow lay

68
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:33,330
it was like ooh i don't want

69
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:34,710
to drink this water yeah but it

70
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:36,600
was just like some sort of preconceived

71
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:38,280
new ships in my head though now

72
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,660
we're like say if i drink too

73
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,160
much the night before and i'll

74
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:43,350
wake up with like oh i need

75
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:44,610
some water i'll go i don't want

76
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:46,230
to go all the way upstairs to

77
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:48,090
our like our big you know we

78
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:50,130
have the filter the dispenser thing you

79
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:51,120
know like i don't want to go

80
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,170
all the way upstairs and i have

81
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:54,150
to think to myself there's a bathroom

82
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:55,620
right next to you idiot just like

83
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:58,110
go drink some water yeah and so

84
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:00,570
yeah it's fine it's fine to drink

85
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,680
but i think it used to be

86
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:03,240
bad and i think that david i

87
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,469
think that they've improved it but do

88
00:03:04,469 --> 00:03:05,340
you think that they were just trying

89
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:07,020
to cash in like these companies were

90
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:10,920
like k na is like so fancy

91
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,540
and only like rich people have those

92
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:14,910
my perception and that then like oh

93
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:16,320
what if we make these other brands

94
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,940
cheaper than other people will buy water

95
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:19,080
too and it'll be like less of

96
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,150
a class thing yeah no now so

97
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:21,840
many people buy

98
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:23,220
water that it's weird to drink it

99
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:25,080
out of the tap yeah when i

100
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,880
saw it i mean this this could

101
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,890
be fake but i saw on that

102
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:31,200
penelope that penn and teller show bullshit

103
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,600
they were they were sounding way i'm

104
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:36,510
sorry but bull crap thank you they

105
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:39,270
were um showing the most companies just

106
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:40,980
like can't go out of a hose

107
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:41,820
and just like

108
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:43,710
pour it into

109
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:46,890

151
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,990
thing when i was in fifth grade

152
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:08,940
i think where we all it was

153
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:10,350
a school project where we all had

154
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:13,500
your writing modesty infinite jest yes i

155
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,700
wrote it fitted just in the fifth

156
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,530
grade um no we had to write

157
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:18,630
like a letter to the principal about

158
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:20,400
something and ah

159
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:22,080
i think that was just any thought

160
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,460
it was like demands

161
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:26,958
more like a ransom notes that we

162
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:28,110
get out of the newspaper

163
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,890
but i don't remember why we had

164
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:33,210
to write this but i do remember

165
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:36,210
writing mine about the drinking fountains in

166
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:38,160
and how they should be fixed that

167
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,170
when someone turns on the other one

168
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,630

00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:49,440
me into his office to explain why

172
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:51,300
that was the case and how it

173
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,490

483
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:27,930
a like an o d kind of

484
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:30,000
situation they found if he would just

485
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,260
rushed to the hospital rest of the

486
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:32,910
hospital for whatever reason they assume an

487
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:34,830
o d let's look here too much

488
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:35,310
semen

489
00:16:37,063 --> 00:16:38,670
the fuck could that how is the

490
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:41,250
full half what would be happening for

491
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,050
that to be just that he had

492
00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:44,640
a challenge where he was like all

493
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:45,870
i could think more semen than you

494
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:48,240
and there's no but i remember as

495
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,220
a child like no one questioned it

496
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:52,050
at all i believe that was just

497
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:54,330
like the physics of it like yeah

498
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:56,010
anything that's like you you wouldn't drink

499
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:56,580
that much fruit

500
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:57,510
a punch and have to go to

501
00:16:57,510 --> 00:16:58,770
the hospital he just all like whoa

502
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,170
what's happened also how much to produce

503
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:02,910
that much yeah well i mean you

504
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:04,290
are we talking about over what amount

505
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:05,520
well that's the question is the one

506
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,250
guy over years and rod stewart shazam

507
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:09,690
big day where he was like yeah

508
00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:11,038
he's a good job but it was

509
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,660
the game where the guys stuff finally

510
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:13,890
built up enough that he could do

511
00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:15,120
the challenge where he drinks a whole

512
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,050
paint can of it

513
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:20,520
oh okay okay yeah it just looks

514
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:23,670
like prior washed out they tell me

515
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:26,340
who's got a screwdriver and then richard

516
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:28,410
gere time as i asked going on

517
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:30,270
a main know i heard though probably

518
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:31,740
in like the fourth grade or something

519
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:33,360
like that and it was covered in

520
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,280
the fourth grade to absolute certainty that

521
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,900
it happens and that this was

522
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,370
is something that they heard from someone

523
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:42,180
reputable yeah like well my my dad

524
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:43,860
heard it from this person or what

525
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:45,390
yeah you know is like he was

526
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:47,490
rushed to the hospital and a found

527
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:49,410
alive durable of his ass and then

528
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:52,230
i remember being like why well because

529
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:53,940
there's a certain feeling when it's up

530
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:56,460
there that that it feels good doing

531
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:57,060
a little claw

532
00:17:57,065 --> 00:18:01,020
love scratching at your prostate soft tissue

533
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,590
so thick yeah but i like to

534
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:05,700
imagine a lot of people doing it

535
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:08,010
yeah yeah no i like to imagine

536
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:09,930
it that's for sure well like the

537
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:11,130
about the moment it got in there

538
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:12,841
like you can't really squeeze it so

539
00:18:12,877 --> 00:18:15,090
it got really small gotta i don't

540
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:17,190
think lush it's rib cage i assumed

541
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:18,570
he put like some sort of bait

542
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,280
up there right oh like a little

543
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:20,940
hamster treat

544
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:24,090

545
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:26,190
cheese like swiss cheese that holes in

546
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:28,020

it's really it's it's a bummer to

1106
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:20,360
read the thoughts of people who think

1107
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:22,220
such horrible things like i'm not have

1108
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:23,870

1109
00:36:23,870 --> 00:36:25,820
be opening my phone mindlessly and then

1110
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:27,230
reading some horrific new

1111
00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:28,520

1117
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:40,100
like hashtags where i i hate people

1119
00:36:42,739 --> 00:36:44,300

that hashtag and i'll go down the

1125
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:53,420
list of the six or seven people

you know since i last yeah i'll

1127
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:56,510

it's like well that's interesting my fucking

1129
00:36:58,250 --> 00:37:01,490

1131
00:37:03,470 --> 00:37:05,300
not that looking at my twitter page

things yeah you know like i want

1136
00:37:10,970 --> 00:37:13,430
them not to have access to good

00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,580
complaints about it and for all the

1172
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:13,490
love from it people are very fanatical

1173
00:38:13,490 --> 00:38:15,050
about this show and it really means

1174
00:38:15,050 --> 00:38:16,010
a lot to them and it's people

1175
00:38:16,010 --> 00:38:18,530
that you that are normally not fanatical

1176
00:38:18,530 --> 00:38:20,480
about stuff like this that really get

1177
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:23,930
into it complain about the quality of

1178
00:38:23,930 --> 00:38:25,670
it that the you know the last

1179
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:26,030
season

1180
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:27,770
let them down and wasn't as good

1181
00:38:27,770 --> 00:38:29,743
since this porn this this season is

1182
00:38:29,787 --> 00:38:33,020
war this port was based port was

1183
00:38:33,050 --> 00:38:34,850
be coy with the store

1184
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:37,880
this poor winter dragon when it got

1185
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,590
to the point with the rape and

1186
00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:42,830
pillaging um i think all the major

1187
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:44,300
you're not far off

1188
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:48,470
i feel that the quality is pretty

1189
00:38:48,470 --> 00:38:51,380
much a straight line all season with

1190
00:38:51,410 --> 00:38:54,740
very tiny ornamental down up and down

1191
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:56,810
like but not not like a wide

1192
00:38:56,810 --> 00:38:58,640
yoyo ing know i feel like it's

1193
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,200
always been about the same of a

1194
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:02,840
show yeah i don't understand but at

1195
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:05,600
the same time i understand like say

1196
00:39:05,630 --> 00:39:07,850
there was something that i loved dearly

1197
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,290
like like i've given up on the

1198
00:39:09,290 --> 00:39:11,210
star wars stuff you know like when

1199
00:39:11,210 --> 00:39:13,670
the prequels came out i remember brian

1200
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:14,810
hussein and i were around the same

1201
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:16,790
age twenty eight or whatever and just

1202
00:39:16,790 --> 00:39:19,160
so mad at them you know and

1203
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:21,230
so mad at george lucas i actually

1204
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:24,110
literally gave away all of my anger

1205
00:39:24,110 --> 00:39:25,790
for star wars ah

1206
00:39:25,910 --> 00:39:29,450
the day that george lucas sold star

1207
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:31,640
wars to disney and then gave away

1208
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:33,560
all that money to kids or whatever

1209
00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:35,060
yeah like you gave away that billion

1210
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:36,800
dollars or whatever to kids in need

1211
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,390
or whatever i was like why have

1212
00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:40,850
i been carrying around such like weird

1213
00:39:40,850 --> 00:39:43,220
anger to george lucas for fucking something

1214
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,750
i have the original three that i

1215
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:45,950
like yeah who cares

1216
00:39:45,962 --> 00:39:47,120
and i like the new ones you

1217
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,800
know fine or whatever so i like

1218
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:50,510
i'm in a much better place of

1219
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:53,810
like not blaming people for like things

1220
00:39:53,810 --> 00:39:54,980
are good things that movies are hard

1221
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:57,230
to make who cares but at the

1222
00:39:57,230 --> 00:39:58,850
same time i can understand like if

1223
00:39:58,850 --> 00:40:00,856
something that i really love like the

1224
00:40:00,856 --> 00:40:02,840
the marvel movies recently if they had

1225
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:05,600
fucked up avengers endgame two to a

1226
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:06,110
point i

1227
00:40:06,110 --> 00:40:07,190
i would have been like so bummed

1228
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:09,050
about it but not like calling for

1229
00:40:09,050 --> 00:40:10,520
these people's heads you know but the

1230
00:40:10,548 --> 00:40:12,590
stuff like star wars was very important

1231
00:40:12,590 --> 00:40:14,870
to me indiana jones was very important

1232
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:16,010
to me when i was a kid

1233
00:40:16,370 --> 00:40:17,570
but then that second one came out

1234
00:40:17,570 --> 00:40:18,830
like three years later it's like oh

1235
00:40:18,890 --> 00:40:20,280
we don't have to like this oh

1236
00:40:20,317 --> 00:40:21,440
i liked it you know what i

1237
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:22,700
mean like when i was on board

1238
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:24,410
i was still young enough to to

1239
00:40:24,410 --> 00:40:26,270
really be on board with the

1240
00:40:26,875 --> 00:40:28,225
and and and really enjoy it i

1241
00:40:28,225 --> 00:40:29,725
saw that one like three times yeah

1242
00:40:29,755 --> 00:40:31,255
like going wasn't all good as the

1243
00:40:31,255 --> 00:40:33,955
first one but yeah um but then

1244
00:40:34,015 --> 00:40:36,595
ah when i think about like star

1245
00:40:36,595 --> 00:40:38,785
wars specifically those when i was a

1246
00:40:38,785 --> 00:40:40,555
kid those movies were very important when

1247
00:40:40,555 --> 00:40:41,695
the prequels came out i was excited

1248
00:40:41,695 --> 00:40:43,135
to see them and to me the

1249
00:40:43,135 --> 00:40:44,635
sin of those movies was that they

1250
00:40:44,635 --> 00:40:46,705
just weren't that fun yeah the fun

1251
00:40:46,705 --> 00:40:47,035
and fun

1252
00:40:47,035 --> 00:40:48,955
any like humor is so important to

1253
00:40:48,955 --> 00:40:51,505
them then forget those star wars movies

1254
00:40:51,505 --> 00:40:52,945
are so funny and that's why the

1255
00:40:52,945 --> 00:40:54,654
last two have been great i mean

1256
00:40:54,835 --> 00:40:55,945
they've been fun to watch they've been

1257
00:40:55,945 --> 00:40:57,895
fun to other adventures but none of

1258
00:40:57,895 --> 00:40:59,732
these movies are perfect it's like exactly

1259
00:40:59,755 --> 00:41:01,195
there's i had a big conversation about

1260
00:41:01,195 --> 00:41:03,775

the instructor because he was texting and

shoe shopping in japan really difficult and

1965
01:11:13,975 --> 01:11:15,925
when yes and when she and chinese

1966
01:11:15,955 --> 01:11:17,365

1967
01:11:17,365 --> 01:11:18,505

1968
01:11:18,535 --> 01:11:20,455
are you when she told the lady

1969
01:11:20,455 --> 01:11:24,205
her size the woman shrieked with laughter

1970
01:11:24,805 --> 01:11:26,425
that makes sense i when we went

1971
01:11:26,425 --> 01:11:28,045
mike and i went to tokyo a

1972
01:11:28,045 --> 01:11:30,145
few years ago am

1973
01:11:31,945 --> 01:11:33,115
we were looking everywhere for shoes because

1974
01:11:33,115 --> 01:11:34,765
there were so many amazing shoe stores

1975
01:11:34,765 --> 01:11:36,595
and i just wanted to buy something

1976
01:11:36,595 --> 01:11:39,115
cool and unique but every store didn't

1977
01:11:39,115 --> 01:11:43,675
carry size ten women choose em we

1978
01:11:43,675 --> 01:11:45,685
finally found a store that did and

1979
01:11:45,685 --> 01:11:47,155
then we got these cool nike high-tops

1980
01:11:47,635 --> 01:11:49,615
and then we wore them immediately and

1981
01:11:49,615 --> 01:11:51,415
they were so uncomfortable that i was

1982
01:11:51,446 --> 01:11:53,875
like these are fake like right there

1983
01:11:53,875 --> 01:11:55,105
at the base of these is like

1984
01:11:55,135 --> 01:11:57,865
cardboard like they're not nikes and it

1985
01:11:57,865 --> 01:11:59,485
was really disappointing and we had to

1986
01:11:59,485 --> 01:12:00,565
throw them out eventually because it was

1987
01:12:00,565 --> 01:12:01,765
like i can never wear them or

1988
01:12:01,765 --> 01:12:03,835
not it's not a good shoe and

1989
01:12:03,835 --> 01:12:04,945
you don't want that to mar your

1990
01:12:04,945 --> 01:12:07,795
memory of a otherwise wonderful trip well

1991
01:12:07,795 --> 01:12:08,725
yeah and his problem was that he

1992
01:12:08,725 --> 01:12:09,595
put them on right when we walked

1993
01:12:09,595 --> 01:12:10,945
out the store as we were leaving

1994
01:12:10,945 --> 01:12:11,575
he's like i'm going to switch

1995
01:12:11,605 --> 01:12:12,985
to the issues and then we were

1996
01:12:12,985 --> 01:12:14,379
walking around and got lost and stuff

1997
01:12:14,379 --> 01:12:15,265
and he was so mad about the

1998
01:12:15,265 --> 01:12:16,495
shoes hurting and it was like

1999
01:12:17,725 --> 01:12:19,375
but we we had a good day

2000
01:12:19,525 --> 01:12:21,115
he's very good at maps and figuring

2001
01:12:21,115 --> 01:12:23,035
out where things aren't that i would

2002
01:12:23,035 --> 01:12:25,615
say for me tokyo was very confusing

2003
01:12:25,915 --> 01:12:27,235
in certain areas because there a lot

2004
01:12:27,235 --> 01:12:28,765
of like small unmarked streets and he

2005
01:12:28,765 --> 01:12:30,715
would find we were going even if

2006
01:12:30,715 --> 01:12:32,275
there was no address i was like

2007
01:12:32,305 --> 01:12:33,475
i don't know how this is working

2008
01:12:33,475 --> 01:12:35,787
because it was very attractive what if

2009
01:12:35,787 --> 01:12:36,925
i found out that he was not

2010
01:12:36,925 --> 01:12:37,735
a real person

2011
01:12:38,515 --> 01:12:41,875
let me find ma it's working

2012
01:12:43,045 --> 01:12:44,425
