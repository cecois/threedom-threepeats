362
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:39,970
bass riffs se suno was a dog

363
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,680
the premise is that there's this little

364
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,080
cat litter and he he falls into

365
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,280
a pack of dogs in the city

366
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:47,440
this is the company yeah and then

367
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:50,650
to a willing little girl like professor

368
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:52,180
and marianne you know just being the

369
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:55,030
rest which every dog is company the

370
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:57,372
cat in and then he gets stolen

371
00:12:57,372 --> 00:12:57,520
and

372
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,230
and ends up being a whole thing

373
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:00,010
where the dogs had to get him

00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:29,500
it was chicago and i mean it

559
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:30,400
was not expensive

560
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,809
so it was not attic so two

561
00:19:31,809 --> 00:19:33,160
hundred dollars for my friend too and

562
00:19:33,163 --> 00:19:34,570
yeah it was it was essentially like

563
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:35,890
twenty bucks a person yeah if you

564
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,690
have people to go but casey kind

565
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:39,040
of thought that it was more like

566
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:41,740
a private screening thing where she would

567
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:43,990
be given an opportunity to speak before

568
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:45,940
and this movie that was like nothing

569
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:47,500
to do with no it just like

570
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,570

637
00:21:51,545 --> 00:21:53,735
roommates free fall in love

638
00:21:54,905 --> 00:21:57,036
what a beautiful question i wonder what

639
00:21:57,036 --> 00:21:59,165
the percentage will make falling because we've

640
00:21:59,165 --> 00:22:00,395
all had roommates weed by the way

641
00:22:00,395 --> 00:22:02,285
we have not returned to our roommate

642
00:22:02,315 --> 00:22:04,355
we have roommate right but the problem

643
00:22:04,355 --> 00:22:06,125
is oh that's right where we looked

644
00:22:06,725 --> 00:22:08,405
out about that shit we were going

645
00:22:08,405 --> 00:22:10,055
to recount all of our origin never

646
00:22:10,055 --> 00:22:11,975
had cannot go back to it unless

647
00:22:11,975 --> 00:22:13,355
we know where we left off and

648
00:22:13,475 --> 00:22:14,585
some are made don't want to talk

649
00:22:14,585 --> 00:22:14,825
about

650
00:22:15,725 --> 00:22:17,315
i feel like about all of them

651
00:22:17,435 --> 00:22:18,905
i remember where i left off i

652
00:22:18,905 --> 00:22:22,865
think but but in any case everyone

653
00:22:22,865 --> 00:22:25,085
who's had a roommate what percentage hands

654
00:22:25,085 --> 00:22:27,455
up what percentage of the following we

655
00:22:27,455 --> 00:22:28,985
can see you right now like they

656
00:22:28,985 --> 00:22:30,545
don't ah even if they know each

657
00:22:30,545 --> 00:22:33,455
other beforehand whatever how many roommates fall

658
00:22:33,455 --> 00:22:35,135
in love i would say maybe

659
00:22:35,735 --> 00:22:38,225
point five percent i think it's fifty

660
00:22:38,225 --> 00:22:40,535
percent wow yeah i think it's like

661
00:22:40,535 --> 00:22:43,265
eighty nine percent fall um

662
00:22:44,225 --> 00:22:47,495

go back to that old look it's

785
00:26:48,575 --> 00:26:50,555

00:27:04,385 --> 00:27:06,275
the street and he straightens his hair

794
00:27:06,275 --> 00:27:09,725
i think wow yeah because it's curly

795
00:27:09,725 --> 00:27:11,785
naturally know he's straight i believe it's

796
00:27:11,926 --> 00:27:12,065

797
00:27:13,325 --> 00:27:15,245

806
00:27:32,075 --> 00:27:32,735
that you don't think he

992
00:33:38,605 --> 00:33:41,095
okay anyway i find it boring to

993
00:33:41,095 --> 00:33:42,295
me i think this is the part

994
00:33:42,295 --> 00:33:44,725
where they actually do kill you yeah

995
00:33:44,755 --> 00:33:46,045
so they take you to this place

996
00:33:46,045 --> 00:33:47,155
and then does the monster come

997
00:33:47,725 --> 00:33:49,975
like he's running fifty minutes like go

998
00:33:49,975 --> 00:33:51,535
through the house like you know there's

999
00:33:51,535 --> 00:33:53,005
a story that they're telling you of

1000
00:33:53,005 --> 00:33:54,445
like oh come this way do you

1001
00:33:54,445 --> 00:33:55,375
have to do this thing and this

1002
00:33:55,375 --> 00:33:56,755
task has to be accomplished you have

1003
00:33:56,755 --> 00:33:58,285
to like work together like do something

1004
00:33:58,705 --> 00:33:59,695
then you have to get into this

1005
00:34:00,265 --> 00:34:01,795
yeah i'm assuming here that i went

1006
00:34:01,825 --> 00:34:04,075
there was like a giant table that

1007
00:34:04,075 --> 00:34:05,365
you crawl under like as if you're

1008
00:34:05,365 --> 00:34:07,675
small and then rolling big

1009
00:34:08,215 --> 00:34:09,865
legs walked by and it was like

1010
00:34:09,865 --> 00:34:12,085
really cool interesting that sounds cool because

1011
00:34:12,415 --> 00:34:13,615
it was memorable and it was cool

1012
00:34:13,825 --> 00:34:15,985
but i there's parts where like someone

1013
00:34:15,985 --> 00:34:17,185
gets chosen to go into a room

1014
00:34:17,185 --> 00:34:18,655
with someone and then something happens and

1015
00:34:18,655 --> 00:34:19,495
then you don't know and you get

1016
00:34:19,495 --> 00:34:20,425
separated from your group and i was

1017
00:34:20,425 --> 00:34:22,165

1018
00:34:22,165 --> 00:34:24,355
like to huddle with everyone yeah i

1019
00:34:24,355 --> 00:34:26,185
get too scared yeah that's to be

1020
00:34:26,185 --> 00:34:27,865
pulled away from the group is ce

1021
00:34:27,865 --> 00:34:28,975

1022
00:34:29,005 --> 00:34:30,925

who's saving it aw on the two

1340
00:46:29,275 --> 00:46:32,215
zahn threes and fours we skip the

1341
00:46:32,215 --> 00:46:33,025
fives

1342
00:46:33,415 --> 00:46:35,245
come back around on the six is

1343
00:46:35,935 --> 00:46:37,915
seven o'clock we take a big long

1344
00:46:37,915 --> 00:46:40,795
break because we're very hungry and we

1345
00:46:40,795 --> 00:46:42,565
need a big buffet meal we go

1346
00:46:42,565 --> 00:46:44,215
to hometown buffet we get the chicken

1347
00:46:44,245 --> 00:46:45,805
and the pizza which is not something

1348
00:46:45,805 --> 00:46:47,725
you normally get at any other restaurant

1349
00:46:47,725 --> 00:46:48,775
but when you see it on one

1350
00:46:48,775 --> 00:46:50,365
of those buffets you just can't help

1351
00:46:50,365 --> 00:46:53,245
yourself because the flavor profiles are

1352
00:46:53,395 --> 00:46:55,375
too good

1353
00:46:56,665 --> 00:46:58,435
two goods or reviews is what i

1354
00:46:58,435 --> 00:47:00,985
say and why would your reviews it

1355
00:47:00,985 --> 00:47:02,905
i mean you're paying for it and

1356
00:47:02,905 --> 00:47:04,645
they throw away most of the food

1357
00:47:04,645 --> 00:47:06,835
when you're done so why not eat

1358
00:47:06,835 --> 00:47:08,245
all you want when you're at that

1359
00:47:08,245 --> 00:47:11,995
buffet is really a business model that

1360
00:47:11,995 --> 00:47:14,245
cannot fail make a whole bunch of

1361
00:47:14,245 --> 00:47:16,225
