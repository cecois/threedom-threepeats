like i think it's an a play

181
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:28,230
that hearing about people's experiences in vietnam

182
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:30,570
is a lot like listening to their

183
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:32,790
dreams like it's so foreign

184
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:34,740
that it's just fearing to listen to

185
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:37,740
missive that's what i don't know i

186
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:39,000

187
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,190

309
00:10:59,115 --> 00:11:00,945

to become easy almost eminence to just

636
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:13,630
twenty five minutes into the you were

637
00:24:13,642 --> 00:24:16,600

639
00:24:19,575 --> 00:24:22,720

yeah it jumps out of the pool

641
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:27,910

you can't make that a thing

662
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:09,310
right

663
00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:12,580
it already became a thing in-between last

664
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:14,680
episode this guy me i'm just capitalizing

665
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:17,500
on all bw right oh you mean

666
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:19,750

00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:27,190
we're back we are back and you

668
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:28,720
know what time it is on our

669
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,520
last episode of three of them poor

670
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:33,610
through threesome we had the eminem challenge

671
00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:36,520
where we tasted seven types of memes

672
00:25:36,965 --> 00:25:38,830
and now our tummies hurt yeah they

673
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:40,750
feel bad and sick we do six

674
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:40,930
more

675
00:25:40,930 --> 00:25:43,120
that's right we went from feeling elated

676
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:45,820
to feeling tired to feeling sick well

677
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:47,800
i it's i eat more candy my

678
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,210
belief is that we should end with

679
00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:51,430
these brownies because these brown ones because

680
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:53,590
this is going to take over all

681
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:55,330
flavor pow oh really i was thinking

682
00:25:55,330 --> 00:25:56,710
start with them because they're clearly going

683
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:57,880
to be the worst they are but

684
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,080
i mean i think that's gonna ruin

685
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,220
the alright i think that's a good

686
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:01,090
that's a good point yeah

687
00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:03,250
yeah wait a minute okay yeah got

688
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:04,810
it so wait a minute let me

689
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:06,370
explain what i mean let me i

690
00:26:06,370 --> 00:26:08,080
was all talk i wanna talk to

691
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,030
and i think for all targets time

692
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:12,010
this is the way it goes um

693
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,900
on our last episode we tasted seven

694
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:15,400
types of eminem's and we picked our

695
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,770
top three flavors i mean our tasting

696
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:20,020
six other types were gonna pick our

697
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:20,710
top three

698
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:22,510
and then those six will go up

699
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:24,880
against each other head-to-head next week with

700
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,370
possibly the addition of crispy possibly we

701
00:26:27,370 --> 00:26:28,600
can get our hands on some crispy

702
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:29,740
we're definitely going to do it and

703
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:31,120

704
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,680
are as we eat them paul do

705
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:33,940
you want to kick it off should

706
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:35,230

we're gonna tell you what we think

712
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:49,690
the problem with pretzels the pretzels always

713
00:26:49,690 --> 00:26:51,010
feel stale but i still keep going

714
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:51,490
do i mean

715
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:55,030
huh i like the combo but i

716
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:56,290
know what you mean about the pretzels

717
00:26:56,650 --> 00:27:00,400
like it's not the freshest tasting at

718
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,660
the end of it i'm kinda like

719
00:27:01,690 --> 00:27:02,650
oh it felt hollow

720
00:27:04,210 --> 00:27:07,450
like life yeah the hollow man in

721
00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:09,610

725
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:22,540
like nutella exactly

726
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,290
hazelnut looks a little like the peanut

727
00:27:26,290 --> 00:27:29,410
butter in size they're not quite as

728
00:27:29,410 --> 00:27:31,690
big as almond oh

729
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:33,100
oh

730
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,450
i don't think i liked that very

731
00:27:37,450 --> 00:27:39,400
much it's a little like the toffee

732
00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:41,800
oh god well bit ooh it's almost

733
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,240
as a fruit flavor to it little

734
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:45,400
bitter medicinal to me yeah

735
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:50,140

744
00:28:05,808 --> 00:28:06,400
i love it

745
00:28:06,610 --> 00:28:07,240
wow

746
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:12,400
i like a dark chocolate i'll go

747
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:14,830
wow i feel like if you're getting

748
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,350
these taste like regular if you're good

749
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:19,540
no we're getting dark chocolate it's like

750
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:22,210
no healthier thing more bitter nova getting

751
00:28:22,210 --> 00:28:23,830
an m a number of it a

752
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:26,410
dozen yeah i would say a dark

753
00:28:26,410 --> 00:28:27,280
chocolate um

754
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,300
is probably just as many calories as

755
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:32,080
a regular right

756
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:35,650
i didn't like that i think it's

757
00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:35,860
okay

758
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:39,040
alright what's next it also tastes like

759
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,987
nothing to me tasted yeah i think

760
00:28:40,987 --> 00:28:43,300
we should go almond then meant then

761
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:45,730
coffee yes okay yeah alright next up

762
00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:47,710
is almond these look a lot like

763
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:49,570
the peanut i mean i can't lie

764
00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:50,950
they look a lot like peanut

765
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:55,030
an almond is a nut so i'm

766
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:58,420
skeptical it makes sense when you think

767
00:28:58,420 --> 00:28:59,770
about it i don't like it

768
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:03,640
it's got a lot of nutty flavor

769
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:06,670
it's more nutty than liking life

770
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:09,400
but there's more no you're not

771
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:11,110
okay

772
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,300
do what a bidder

773
00:29:14,290 --> 00:29:17,350
oh yeah what was that oh helicopter

774
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:19,870
they start to bizarre law and he's

775
00:29:19,870 --> 00:29:21,760
like a bizarre law is like a

776
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,520
bizarre mwah yeah that might have been

777
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:25,750
the original song there might have been

778
00:29:26,530 --> 00:29:27,490
and it came to all of us

779
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:28,990
just anybody want a peanut is from

780
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:32,560
that young baby like ah mandy patinkin

781
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:33,970
movie princess bride

782
00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:35,440
yes it was andre the giant one

783
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,440
of those earliest screen roles certainly my

784
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:41,770
giant was based on his friendship with

785
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:42,790
billy crystal

786
00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:45,700
but they got a different giant i

787
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,050
think so because he was dead right

788
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:50,410
oh hello what yeah under your eyes

789
00:29:50,410 --> 00:29:52,271

974
00:36:34,835 --> 00:36:36,065
but why are you so upset because

975
00:36:36,065 --> 00:36:38,465
your operators are surprised that amazon sells

976
00:36:38,465 --> 00:36:39,815
dildo are you so upset because you

977
00:36:39,815 --> 00:36:40,895
already have a bunch and you like

978
00:36:40,895 --> 00:36:41,945
why would they even think i need

979
00:36:41,945 --> 00:36:44,045
this yeah like trying to stop trying

980
00:36:44,045 --> 00:36:45,155
to show me the thing i already

981
00:36:45,185 --> 00:36:47,525
bought amazon has everything that's it's crazy

982
00:36:47,525 --> 00:36:48,725
that you can buy a dildo in

983
00:36:48,725 --> 00:36:50,015
the same cart as you put in

984
00:36:50,045 --> 00:36:53,675
a realistic raven yeah but it really

985
00:36:53,675 --> 00:36:54,215
was

986
00:36:54,305 --> 00:36:56,345
this is absolutely not the place to

987
00:36:56,345 --> 00:36:58,025

988
00:36:58,025 --> 00:37:01,025
for halloween early children's kid you couldn't

989
00:37:01,055 --> 00:37:03,095
cure his holiday that you will have

990
00:37:03,095 --> 00:37:04,805
to be a joy joy i think

991
00:37:04,805 --> 00:37:07,355
dill doe's shouldn't be a suggested search

992
00:37:07,355 --> 00:37:08,645
i think you should have to know

993
00:37:08,645 --> 00:37:10,685
what i just know you ok i

994
00:37:10,685 --> 00:37:14,435
don't listen to what google dot corn

995
00:37:14,525 --> 00:37:15,905
do you know what like you can

996
00:37:15,995 --> 00:37:17,645
use if you start having a vagina

997
00:37:18,365 --> 00:37:19,865
it isn't fill it in like there

998
00:37:19,865 --> 00:37:20,765

like the weirdest things and then it

1003

won't fill in like terms you might

1004
00:37:29,075 --> 00:37:30,455
want to learn about but that could

1005
00:37:30,455 --> 00:37:33,035
be perceived as like right pro-choice or

1006
00:37:33,035 --> 00:37:35,855

1060

live for them sitting around in bed

1061
00:39:29,405 --> 00:39:29,555
till

1062
00:39:29,585 --> 00:39:33,935
eleven that was an except shop was

1063
00:39:33,935 --> 00:39:37,025
yesterday we were right my days feel

1064
00:39:37,025 --> 00:39:38,975
very busy in this way i don't

1065
00:39:38,975 --> 00:39:40,535
know yeah i feel like there was

1066
00:39:40,565 --> 00:39:44,015
there was this you know huge swath

1067
00:39:44,015 --> 00:39:45,485
of dead space for a while and

1068
00:39:45,485 --> 00:39:46,775
then all of a sudden everything got

1069
00:39:46,895 --> 00:39:48,935
extremely busy it's you know when cell

1070
00:39:48,935 --> 00:39:49,715
phones were firm

1071
00:39:49,715 --> 00:39:52,595
first invented yes i do ren deny

1072
00:39:52,655 --> 00:39:54,785
told you think i am ah aren't

1073
00:39:54,785 --> 00:39:56,555
you too yes some two years old

1074
00:39:57,515 --> 00:39:58,835
my friend and i say that you

1075
00:39:58,835 --> 00:39:59,495
were younger

1076
00:40:00,545 --> 00:40:02,345
because i wouldn't remember something to invented

1077
00:40:02,645 --> 00:40:03,905
my friend and i had ah had

1078
00:40:03,905 --> 00:40:06,305
an agreement we said like okay we're

1079
00:40:06,305 --> 00:40:07,286
not going to get him because and

1080
00:40:07,286 --> 00:40:09,335
this was our our theory was that

1081
00:40:09,605 --> 00:40:11,075
if you get a cell phone everyone

1082
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:13,745
will always assume that you are reachable

1083
00:40:13,745 --> 00:40:15,155
all the time and then you'll have

1084
00:40:15,155 --> 00:40:17,375
to constantly be responding to things in

1085
00:40:17,495 --> 00:40:19,505
common fallacy of cell phones which it

1086
00:40:19,535 --> 00:40:20,675
well i mean

1087
00:40:20,705 --> 00:40:22,535
it it is a thing like i

1088
00:40:22,565 --> 00:40:23,765
think it's kind of true it's kind

1089
00:40:23,765 --> 00:40:25,835
of true that people assume that but

1090
00:40:25,835 --> 00:40:27,425
it's i was you to say no

1091
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:29,075
i'm not right and i think i

1092
00:40:29,105 --> 00:40:32,465
do respond very quickly and i create

1093
00:40:32,525 --> 00:40:34,565
a loop where i'm like i but

1094
00:40:34,632 --> 00:40:35,855
it's weird if i don't respond when

1095
00:40:35,855 --> 00:40:36,965
i was gonna say though is that

1096
00:40:36,995 --> 00:40:40,385
the now being quarantined everyone now assumes

1097
00:40:40,385 --> 00:40:40,835
that you have no

1098
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:43,600
and yes day so i don't like

1099
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:46,180
that yeah so it feels it but

1100
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:47,380
it just it feels like having a

1101
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:49,300
cell phone when cell phones were invented

1102
00:40:49,450 --> 00:40:51,940
compounded now right now you have email

1103
00:40:51,940 --> 00:40:53,770
and you're supposedly just sitting around all

1104
00:40:53,770 --> 00:40:55,480
day now my positions i don't know

1105
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,950
if you're facing this paul but like

1106
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:59,350
why just because you don't want to

1107
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,240
but the

1108
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:03,460
they're like we need it by today

1109
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,350
like it's like very like extremely you

here's the other side of it though

1126
00:41:33,970 --> 00:41:36,337
i think with with just personal communication

1127
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:38,020
and a little bit of professional communication

1128
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:39,580
too with people asking you to do

1129
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:41,770
shows or this or that is that

1130
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:44,110
when people are slow to respond to

1131
00:41:44,110 --> 00:41:47,140
me i'm like oh they're going through

1132
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:48,280

1292
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:57,190

1293
00:46:57,220 --> 00:46:58,180

1294
00:46:58,180 --> 00:46:58,706
emailing you in

like jackasses like no the fuck is

1296

this i don't want anyone to know

1297
00:47:02,110 --> 00:47:04,120
why their their listeners out there who

1298
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:06,040
are so lonely and no emails them

1299
00:47:06,070 --> 00:47:08,740
and they we're so spoiled know i

1300
00:47:08,740 --> 00:47:09,880
mean i can hear how it would

1301
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:13,090
sound like granny or email but usually

1302
00:47:13,090 --> 00:47:14,440
it's what do you want to work

1303
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:16,120
for free that's the email you're saying

1304
00:47:16,270 --> 00:47:18,490
sadly it's presumptuous sort of thing like

1305
00:47:18,490 --> 00:47:18,905
without

1306
00:47:18,970 --> 00:47:20,770
softening it or making it seem like

1307
00:47:20,770 --> 00:47:22,180
friendly in anyway yeah it's kind of

1308
00:47:22,180 --> 00:47:25,300
assumption that is weird yeah huh assumption

1309
00:47:25,660 --> 00:47:28,690
