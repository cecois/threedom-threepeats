not as stage friendly in terms of

182
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:26,820
the picture that is presented on stage

183
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,200

we were in ikea and um who

300

was looking for what break it down

301
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:36,065
i was looking for yergin

00:13:38,975 --> 00:13:40,385
i cannot remember what was being looked

303
00:13:40,385 --> 00:13:41,675
for i might have been looking for

304
00:13:41,675 --> 00:13:44,795
the entertainment center that i put together

305
00:13:44,795 --> 00:13:46,685
and then worried about for a solid

306
00:13:46,685 --> 00:13:48,365
eight years of my apartment that it

307
00:13:48,365 --> 00:13:49,865
was going to topple yes said it

308
00:13:49,865 --> 00:13:51,245
would yeah it would crumble because i

309
00:13:51,245 --> 00:13:52,325
had pieces left over

310
00:13:54,185 --> 00:13:55,445
and i was like i cannot break

311
00:13:55,445 --> 00:13:56,705
this down to start over again this

312
00:13:56,705 --> 00:13:58,925
is it i think they sometimes give

313
00:13:58,925 --> 00:14:03,515
you extra pieces know yeah that was

314
00:14:03,515 --> 00:14:06,515
also the time that i early in

315
00:14:06,515 --> 00:14:08,255
the process of putting this thing together

316
00:14:08,585 --> 00:14:11,585
i um realized i had done something

317
00:14:11,615 --> 00:14:13,565
wrong and

318
00:14:13,655 --> 00:14:15,635
i had to dig out one of

319
00:14:15,635 --> 00:14:19,835
those wooden dowels that i really smacked

320
00:14:19,835 --> 00:14:21,275
in there like it was it was

321
00:14:21,275 --> 00:14:23,315
in there good and i'd get it

322
00:14:23,315 --> 00:14:26,585
out to start over the process and

323
00:14:26,615 --> 00:14:28,085
i didn't know what to use than

324
00:14:28,085 --> 00:14:30,035
i thought ah the perfect tool swiss

325
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:31,685
army knife so

326
00:14:33,005 --> 00:14:35,045
i am so i'm digging this thing

327
00:14:35,045 --> 00:14:38,045
out and somehow i managed to shut

328
00:14:38,045 --> 00:14:41,075
the knife on my finger e and

329
00:14:41,105 --> 00:14:43,145
it went like it went deep enough

330
00:14:43,175 --> 00:14:45,365
in that it looked like a a

331
00:14:46,145 --> 00:14:47,990
novelty gag you know what i mean

332
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:51,005
like oh i cut my finger where

333
00:14:51,005 --> 00:14:52,415
it was like it was in there

334
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:52,985
and i just

335
00:14:53,015 --> 00:14:55,055
stared at it for a while like

336
00:14:56,135 --> 00:14:59,075
this is not good and then i

337
00:14:59,075 --> 00:15:00,095
took it out and there was so

338
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:03,845
much blood so much blood and i

339
00:15:03,845 --> 00:15:05,435

340
00:15:06,095 --> 00:15:08,705
and go to that place she say

341
00:15:09,395 --> 00:15:11,915
who you you said that i said

342
00:15:11,915 --> 00:15:13,025
i believe you're supposed to leave it

343
00:15:13,025 --> 00:15:13,325
in

344
00:15:15,995 --> 00:15:17,399
the first time somewhat first time they

345
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:19,745

346
00:15:19,745 --> 00:15:21,245
to leave it in but i'm still

347
00:15:21,245 --> 00:15:23,225
me but oh to indian repeatedly this

348
00:15:23,225 --> 00:15:24,065
is my belief

349
00:15:25,895 --> 00:15:27,005
and you can't make fun of people's

350
00:15:27,005 --> 00:15:29,135
beliefs you can't you have to respect

351
00:15:29,135 --> 00:15:30,245

involved and put on display at a

1084
00:45:19,375 --> 00:45:22,525
i believe at a college right university

1085
00:45:22,825 --> 00:45:24,685
bridge yeah it might have been for

1086
00:45:24,685 --> 00:45:27,445
all i remember show that stuck in

1087
00:45:27,445 --> 00:45:28,405
your mind as a kid and you

1088
00:45:28,405 --> 00:45:31,075
were like i want that i think

1089
00:45:31,225 --> 00:45:32,215
in when i was a kid i

1090
00:45:32,245 --> 00:45:33,595
don't know i don't know that i

1091
00:45:33,595 --> 00:45:35,215
thought i want that but i was

1092
00:45:35,275 --> 00:45:37,495
certainly not a fascinating yeah you could

1093
00:45:37,495 --> 00:45:39,085
go into a place behind glass was

1094
00:45:39,175 --> 00:45:41,065
dead person that would be so weird

1095
00:45:41,065 --> 00:45:42,955
for the family but i'd be very

1096
00:45:43,015 --> 00:45:44,395
cool if you were an ancestor of

1097
00:45:44,395 --> 00:45:45,625
that person and you got to see

1098
00:45:45,625 --> 00:45:47,545
them here's what i think of even

1099
00:45:47,545 --> 00:45:50,155
cooler is long after anybody even remembers

1100
00:45:50,155 --> 00:45:51,775
who i am that i'm like an

1101
00:45:52,495 --> 00:45:55,281
like an a bar somewhere yeah like

1102
00:45:55,285 --> 00:45:57,985
as a weird curiosity does it never

1103
00:45:58,015 --> 00:46:00,835
rot i guess it does i think

1104
00:46:01,075 --> 00:46:03,145
you could be stuffed could you like

1105
00:46:03,205 --> 00:46:04,855
an animal because we do that i

1106
00:46:04,855 --> 00:46:07,255
had a friend who wanted that legal

1107
00:46:07,825 --> 00:46:08,785
i had a friend who wanted to

1108
00:46:08,785 --> 00:46:10,705
stuff her dog after her dog passed

1109
00:46:10,705 --> 00:46:13,675
away and she was planned on doing

1110
00:46:13,675 --> 00:46:15,085
it and then chicken out of the

1111
00:46:15,085 --> 00:46:16,405

that's a that's a brief summation and

1235
00:51:28,130 --> 00:51:30,860
so was he drawing the shapes out

1236
00:51:30,860 --> 00:51:30,950
of

1237
00:51:30,950 --> 00:51:33,290
his control like it was like yeah

1238
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:34,820
but he was compelled to do it

1239
00:51:34,820 --> 00:51:35,900
he was compelled to do it and

1240
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:39,650
then he leaves his wife and children

1241
00:51:39,770 --> 00:51:41,300
to fucking alien to go

1242
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:44,420
we don't assume a bully i mean

1243
00:51:44,420 --> 00:51:46,220
that happens off screen if at all

1244
00:51:46,550 --> 00:51:48,140
he goes off with them at the

1245
00:51:48,140 --> 00:51:50,660
end so he probably he has to

1246
00:51:50,690 --> 00:51:52,910
was like she makes once he decides

1250
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:00,350
never see his wife and children again

1251
00:52:00,380 --> 00:52:02,480
like were because he goes nuts i'd

1252
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:02,630
like

1253
00:52:02,660 --> 00:52:03,590
to think that he gets on the

1254
00:52:03,590 --> 00:52:05,540
spaceship and you like takes a look

1255
00:52:05,540 --> 00:52:07,490

doing it to you okay i think

1262
00:52:20,690 --> 00:52:22,430
it would be a great school though

1263
00:52:22,460 --> 00:52:24,980
is for that character to come back

00:52:24,980 --> 00:52:27,620

yes i came yesterday and we had

1573
01:05:19,465 --> 01:05:22,105
a very similar conversation to the one

1574
01:05:22,105 --> 01:05:24,595
that we started having earlier just now

1575
01:05:24,865 --> 01:05:25,975
and now i don't know where we

1576
01:05:25,975 --> 01:05:26,215
are

1577
01:05:27,295 --> 01:05:28,255
this is your first time

1578
01:05:30,745 --> 01:05:31,495
doing

1579
01:05:32,785 --> 01:05:35,425
words words no no

1580
01:05:37,015 --> 01:05:39,655
i know lots of words and lots

1581
01:05:39,655 --> 01:05:41,275
of them and i've used them for

1582
01:05:41,275 --> 01:05:43,225
almost all my life other than like

1583
01:05:43,225 --> 01:05:45,985
the first couple years i would say

1584
01:05:45,985 --> 01:05:47,725
i've been using words constantly

1585
01:05:49,165 --> 01:05:49,885
is that all

1586
01:05:51,055 --> 01:05:52,405
no that is not all

1587
01:05:53,935 --> 01:05:55,645
because what you're doing is i think

1588
01:05:55,645 --> 01:05:57,535
it's very undermining and you're trying to

1589
01:05:57,535 --> 01:05:59,155
make your review like gaslighting me or

1590
01:05:59,155 --> 01:05:59,545
something

1591
01:06:00,955 --> 01:06:02,215

1592
01:06:03,745 --> 01:06:05,935

01:06:08,875 --> 01:06:12,295
do his he's got like errands and

1595
01:06:12,895 --> 01:06:14,665
you know people to call and stuff

1596
01:06:14,665 --> 01:06:17,545
like that you know busywork is good

1597
01:06:17,545 --> 01:06:17,875
to you

1598
01:06:19,285 --> 01:06:20,875
he's right you know

1599
01:06:22,225 --> 01:06:25,045
he's very particular about his birthday like

1600
01:06:25,045 --> 01:06:26,815
what you can and cannot give him

1601
01:06:29,365 --> 01:06:30,415
he doesn't beat you

1602
01:06:32,695 --> 01:06:33,325
not

1603
01:06:34,525 --> 01:06:35,845
any more

1604
01:06:36,925 --> 01:06:39,085
there was a strawberry misunderstanding that has

1605
01:06:39,085 --> 01:06:41,245
been sorted out

1606
01:06:42,685 --> 01:06:43,945
whom does he beat

1607
01:06:45,055 --> 01:06:46,555
ooh who me

1608
01:06:48,745 --> 01:06:50,095
d

1609
01:06:51,295 --> 01:06:55,315
uh oh yeah

1610
01:06:56,605 --> 01:06:58,825
how do you judge it scott that

1611
01:06:58,825 --> 01:07:00,205
makes about as much sense as the

1612
01:07:00,205 --> 01:07:02,905
actual well i have to confess that

1613
01:07:02,905 --> 01:07:04,735
it became a three person scene halfway

1614
01:07:04,735 --> 01:07:06,715
and i just switched care to okay

1615
01:07:07,915 --> 01:07:09,685
hopefully there is a two person scene

1616
01:07:09,685 --> 01:07:10,795
in there if not you can use

1617
01:07:10,795 --> 01:07:12,475
the third wilder book which has two

1618
01:07:12,475 --> 01:07:14,575
other plays in it think i found

1619
01:07:14,725 --> 01:07:17,245
you found one okay now how do

1620
01:07:17,245 --> 01:07:20,095
you want us to approach each other

1621
01:07:20,365 --> 01:07:24,385
i want you to um walk like

1622
01:07:24,385 --> 01:07:25,165

patients that he needs to see but

1644
01:08:30,445 --> 01:08:31,465
i can move up to the top

1645
01:08:31,465 --> 01:08:32,395
of the list because i know he

1646
01:08:32,395 --> 01:08:33,745
wants to see you because of your

1647
01:08:33,745 --> 01:08:34,285
condition

01:08:56,125 --> 01:08:57,535
