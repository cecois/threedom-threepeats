that tony is drinking and ah a

299
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:08,880

him or

476
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:49,090

00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:55,330
here he didn't have the greatest place

481
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:56,320
and then she was like hey i'm

00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,243

in the weirdest way and then by

489
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:09,940
the end i was like he's what

490
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:10,791
i thought he was yeah it was

491
00:16:10,804 --> 00:16:12,820
just like yeah no luck anyway

492
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:17,110
so speaking of alcohol you remember the

493
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:19,180
seed i planted about the espresso motel

494
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:21,400
for all i'm thinking about i just

495
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:24,430
i can practically taste it so like

496
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:27,100
what ninety minutes later we are in

497
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:28,780
the piano bar with the ghost pianist

498
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:33,550
whom should watch in but the formation

499
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:36,970
and kevin martel wow just getting there

500
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:39,310
with his significant other in their friends

501
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:43,030
wow we we conjured him know tommy

502
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:45,940
was not supposed to be there whoa

503
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:47,620
she imagined if i had been there

504
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:48,880
i wouldn't have been talking about him

505
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:50,890
i always talked about kevin i talked

506
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:52,720
about all the talk about kevin yes

507
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,680
because normally

508
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:55,090
i'm talking about impure like who is

509
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:57,580
that understand you're like chef kevin but

510
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:59,590
i mean what does so the timing

511
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:00,699
of the habit of going shove it

512
00:17:00,699 --> 00:17:02,950
of course who knows because we weren't

513
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,350
we got there in stages we weren't

514
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:06,970
all there at the exact same time

515
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:08,380
so we sit we were in the

516
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:10,360
bar for a different amount of time

517
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:11,620
than we would have been had we

518
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:12,910
who knows if you guys have been

519
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:13,840
there maybe you would

520
00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:15,460
gotten there earlier than nate and tony

521
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:17,200
because they're coming from further away they

522
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,730
were the last people something like that

523
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:20,590
just doesn't it's not a coincidence it's

524
00:17:20,590 --> 00:17:23,020
fun my opinion it's a fate at

525
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:25,690
the end of the night we go

526
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:28,060
out we're waiting for our cars and

527
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:29,200
you beat the shit out of kevin

528
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:30,790
we wanted to get a man it

529
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:32,770
was satisfying i was like i'm sick

530
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:33,130
i'm hungry

531
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:35,650
um we are getting food they have

532
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:37,000
like a step and repeat they used

533
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,560
to do as i famously talked about

534
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:40,240
in my standup special they used to

535
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,500
do pictures at the table they go

536
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,030
around to the table and charge you

537
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:44,320
way too much money for a picture

538
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,000
of your group but now they just

539
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,440
have a step and repeat outside and

540
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,730
you get somebody to take a picture

541
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:50,590
of they need a dedicated person to

542
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:52,480
do that so if they're they're doing

543
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,800
it on your cell phone yes so

544
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:54,190
we asked

545
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:55,930
one stranger they did a piss poor

546
00:17:55,930 --> 00:17:58,030
job yeah yeah don't focus up if

00:17:58,030 --> 00:17:59,980
somebody asks you take doctor the guy

548
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,387
and they've got all this second lower

549
00:18:01,387 --> 00:18:02,380
you to do it yeah this is

550
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:04,090
an important thing don't fuck around with

551
00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:05,380
yes this guy so he did a

552
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:07,360
terrible job are you gonna propose to

553

620
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,310

of trader ming

926
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,036
that there are whitewashing

929
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,630

930
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:42,660
dance chocolate cake how do you make

931
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:43,950

it to be dead on mike i

935
00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:50,010
don't know what determines the density of

1045
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:10,110
it was not like tabloid he was

1046
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:11,910
more like a us weekly kind of

1047
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:13,680
shit uh-huh and it was picture of

00:35:13,686 --> 00:35:16,171
that's kim kardashian yeah and you can't

1049
00:35:16,171 --> 00:35:17,760
live as a tabloid yeah i feel

1050
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:18,210
like nash

1051
00:35:18,210 --> 00:35:21,060
all enquirers well that's next level with

1052
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:24,300
lulu it yeah i i i think

1053
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:25,710
there are two just yeah there there

1054
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:27,390
should be a distinction between those two

1055
00:35:27,390 --> 00:35:28,830
types of tabloid magazine do you think

1056
00:35:28,830 --> 00:35:30,240
the people at the enquirer like have

1057
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,710
a lot of fun making the articles

1058
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:34,590
because it's basically like celebrity onion yeah

1059
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:36,690

1061
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:41,250

the ground at at a certain point

00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:17,220
it like it's already stocking yeah but

1078
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:20,760
isn't that a threat yeah but i

1079
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,170
mean like could certainly be construed as

1080
00:36:22,170 --> 00:36:24,030
such yeah like therapy david's a whole

it to like we're watching o j

00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:47,250
more security so she's prob

1093
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:49,980

00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:51,990
j simpson thing happened in real time

1095
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:55,770

i wanted to say what an unholy

1157
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:00,750
flat you know there's a thought that

1158
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:03,150
the catholic church forbids but that's why

1159
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:03,900
i want to say they go to

1160
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:05,580

1164
00:39:10,290 --> 00:39:11,640

1310
00:43:46,655 --> 00:43:47,225

00:43:47,245 --> 00:43:48,725
i've got to switch shoes switch

1312
00:43:50,135 --> 00:43:52,385
but but i will say so so

1313
00:43:52,415 --> 00:43:55,745
ah the our team captain was really

1314
00:43:55,745 --> 00:43:58,205
upset during practice he was really upset

1315
00:43:58,205 --> 00:43:59,585
but he got me because he went

1316
00:43:59,585 --> 00:44:01,085
around to i'm won't say who it

1317
00:44:01,085 --> 00:44:02,735
is because the celebrity he went around

1318
00:44:02,735 --> 00:44:04,625
to every person who was there and

1319
00:44:04,625 --> 00:44:06,125
said like how good are you at

1320
00:44:06,965 --> 00:44:08,885
oh no right on a scale of

1321
00:44:08,885 --> 00:44:10,025
one eternally fair

1322
00:44:10,055 --> 00:44:10,865
on a scale of one to ten

1323
00:44:10,937 --> 00:44:13,415
i was thinking as far as celebrities

1324
00:44:13,415 --> 00:44:15,095
go you're asking right you're like i'm

1325
00:44:15,095 --> 00:44:16,655
a seven yeah so i said seven

1326
00:44:16,655 --> 00:44:18,665
i think interesting and he wrote down

1327
00:44:18,665 --> 00:44:20,285
seven and so he picked me for

1328
00:44:20,285 --> 00:44:21,815
his toys what did you think he

1329
00:44:21,815 --> 00:44:23,855
meant for like how good are you

1330
00:44:23,885 --> 00:44:26,345
compared like compared to people who obviously

1331
00:44:26,345 --> 00:44:29,525
play softball yeah no no no no

1332
00:44:29,525 --> 00:44:29,975
no that

1333
00:44:30,245 --> 00:44:31,955
what he meant yeah saying like compared

1334
00:44:31,955 --> 00:44:33,605
to all these people here but you

1335
00:44:33,815 --> 00:44:35,345
know i too are playing football i

1336
00:44:35,345 --> 00:44:37,595
have no idea whether they're good no

1337
00:44:37,595 --> 00:44:39,695
but but what either way you lied

1338
00:44:39,695 --> 00:44:41,645
what i thought yeah it was as

1339
00:44:41,645 --> 00:44:43,655
an idiot who's playing softball how good

1340
00:44:43,685 --> 00:44:44,585
do you think you would be at

1341
00:44:44,585 --> 00:44:46,775
it sure but you still exaggerated your

1342
00:44:46,805 --> 00:44:48,965
bills you were like me oh just

1343
00:44:48,965 --> 00:44:50,165
what you were saying was oh put

1344
00:44:50,165 --> 00:44:50,345
me on

1345
00:44:50,345 --> 00:44:51,425
in your tier list

1346
00:44:52,025 --> 00:44:53,225
oh i was like i'm not i'm

1347
00:44:53,225 --> 00:44:55,145
not like probably like dave koechner who

1348
00:44:55,145 --> 00:44:56,165
is going to be a ten

1349
00:44:57,395 --> 00:45:00,305
as far as like idiot celebrities playing

1350
00:45:00,305 --> 00:45:01,745
softball that's what that's what i thought

1351
00:45:01,745 --> 00:45:02,975
so i was like row seven or

1352
00:45:02,975 --> 00:45:05,045
whatever so so he picks me and

1353
00:45:05,045 --> 00:45:06,425
i guess everyone else was like i'm

1354
00:45:06,425 --> 00:45:07,625
a three year of a two or

1355
00:45:07,625 --> 00:45:10,115
whatever compared because the original question yeah

1356
00:45:10,685 --> 00:45:14,045
so so during practice i'm like whipping

1357
00:45:14,045 --> 00:45:15,845
and swinging at the balls and can't

1358
00:45:15,845 --> 00:45:17,465
connect i'm like wow fuck

1359
00:45:17,465 --> 00:45:19,655
fuck and he comes around to me

1360
00:45:19,655 --> 00:45:21,275
and he's like a seven huh

1361
00:45:23,315 --> 00:45:24,845
oh and i'm like oh i'm sorry

1362
00:45:24,845 --> 00:45:26,105

1363
00:45:26,105 --> 00:45:28,385
as ah but so anyway so but

1364
00:45:28,385 --> 00:45:30,965
the greatest thing my first at bat

1365
00:45:30,965 --> 00:45:33,845
first pitch right out to the outfield

1366
00:45:33,845 --> 00:45:36,725
over the heads of outfielders i come

1367
00:45:36,725 --> 00:45:38,435
back around and then i caught like

1368
00:45:38,435 --> 00:45:39,875
a big wine drive out into the

1369
00:45:39,875 --> 00:45:41,225
outfield everything in the guys like were

1370

but it was really quite dense it's

1377
00:45:56,499 --> 00:45:58,323
the greatest sports experience of mine now

1378
00:45:58,323 --> 00:46:00,245
is this gentleman balls how did they

1379
00:46:00,245 --> 00:46:02,015

1380
00:46:02,015 --> 00:46:03,455

really cool i've played soccer with ted

1402
00:46:45,545 --> 00:46:48,245

the embrace of it then there's a

1417
00:47:20,165 --> 00:47:21,905
backlash against it then there's a backlash

1418
00:47:21,905 --> 00:47:23,825
against the backlash that there's a backlash

1419
00:47:23,825 --> 00:47:25,085
against the backlash that every once in

1420
00:47:25,085 --> 00:47:26,165
a while there's a person that's like

1421
00:47:26,195 --> 00:47:28,835

1436
00:47:53,015 --> 00:47:54,335

people just like whatever they like and

1441
00:48:01,265 --> 00:48:03,575
dislike people not care there was one

1442
00:48:03,575 --> 00:48:07,775
meredith kessler on twitter said i've never

1443
00:48:07,775 --> 00:48:10,175
seen ted lasso but it's fans that's

1444
00:48:10,175 --> 00:48:11,675
what it's talking about yeah they give

1445
00:48:11,675 --> 00:48:14,195
me big um ah adult it was

1446
00:48:14,615 --> 00:48:16,235
childless adults going to disneyland

1447

i thought that was funny but the

1450
00:48:21,125 --> 00:48:23,705
responses to it were about the show

1451
00:48:23,705 --> 00:48:25,445
not about the fans and people were

1452
00:48:25,445 --> 00:48:27,785
like you're you're falling you're falling into

1453
00:48:27,815 --> 00:48:28,985
i think this was a trap but

1454
00:48:28,985 --> 00:48:31,265
it's like your crew are your create

1455
00:48:31,265 --> 00:48:34,535

john wheeler

1531
00:51:22,895 --> 00:51:23,015
or

1532
00:51:24,125 --> 00:51:25,685
a physicist who created the game as

1533
00:51:25,685 --> 00:51:27,335
an example of how consciousness may in

1534
00:51:27,335 --> 00:51:29,915

1559
00:52:18,125 --> 00:52:21,995
up okay lag of law one person

1560

people each independently select their own person

1562
00:52:25,025 --> 00:52:26,585
place or thing to be guessed they

1563
00:52:26,585 --> 00:52:27,875
do not consult with each other or

1564
00:52:27,875 --> 00:52:30,095
know the others selection the guests were

1565
00:52:30,095 --> 00:52:32,585
then alternates asking their twenty yes or

1566
00:52:32,585 --> 00:52:34,595
no questions to each person each time

1567
00:52:34,595 --> 00:52:34,895
an answer

1568
00:52:34,895 --> 00:52:36,935
or is given the other person must

1569
00:52:36,935 --> 00:52:39,035
revise their selection so that the answer

1570
00:52:39,035 --> 00:52:41,645
to the question remains true while staying

1571
00:52:41,645 --> 00:52:43,535
true to all previous answers as well

1572
00:52:43,655 --> 00:52:45,785
here comes the example

1573
00:52:47,075 --> 00:52:48,785
player a is the guesser player b

1574
00:52:48,785 --> 00:52:51,245
is thinking of a car players player

1575
00:52:51,245 --> 00:52:53,855

00:52:54,095 --> 00:52:56,105
player a to player b are you

1577
00:52:56,105 --> 00:52:59,405
thinking of a person player b no

1578
00:52:59,705 --> 00:53:02,465
player c silently changes their selection to

1579
00:53:02,465 --> 00:53:04,655
a non person oh so even if

1580
00:53:04,655 --> 00:53:07,055
it's know you you change okay

1581
00:53:07,055 --> 00:53:08,285
hey so i've got it got it

1582
00:53:08,285 --> 00:53:10,235
got it player a to player c

1583
00:53:10,265 --> 00:53:12,155
are you thinking of something edible player

1584
00:53:12,155 --> 00:53:14,645
c yes player c silently changes their

1585
00:53:14,645 --> 00:53:16,625
selection from a car to something edible

1586
00:53:17,015 --> 00:53:19,625
but not understandable car and so or

1587
00:53:19,625 --> 00:53:21,665
inedible oh okay so i said i

1588
00:53:21,695 --> 00:53:22,745
wish i could eat a ko and

1589
00:53:22,745 --> 00:53:24,485
han and maybe high yeah true for

1590
00:53:24,545 --> 00:53:26,915
every question that has been asked right

1591
00:53:26,945 --> 00:53:27,215
right

1592
00:53:27,335 --> 00:53:28,685
so and then the goal is that

1593
00:53:28,685 --> 00:53:29,855
we're thinking of the same thing right

1594
00:53:30,425 --> 00:53:33,095
after twenty oh okay so oh so

1595
00:53:33,095 --> 00:53:34,145
we don't say it out loud a

1596
00:53:34,145 --> 00:53:36,335
team wins if the final guess is

1597
00:53:36,335 --> 00:53:38,495
correct and all three people wound up

1598
00:53:38,495 --> 00:53:40,235
thinking oh fuck i like this like

1599
00:53:40,235 --> 00:53:41,825
yeah yeah alright well it's trippy like

1600
00:53:41,855 --> 00:53:43,115
yeah okay let me make sure i

1601
00:53:43,115 --> 00:53:45,485
understand it because i'm notorious for thinking

1602
00:53:45,485 --> 00:53:47,165
i understand yeah and not usually

1603
00:53:47,615 --> 00:53:49,445
you i guess twenty questions or do

1604
00:53:49,445 --> 00:53:51,215
you this is you only get twenty

1605
00:53:51,215 --> 00:53:53,135
or do you can you guess it

1606
00:53:53,135 --> 00:53:55,085
but before twenty or up or on

1607
00:53:55,085 --> 00:53:56,645
twenty yeah i think if you guess

1608
00:53:56,645 --> 00:53:58,115
it before you guess it yeah but

1609
00:53:58,145 --> 00:53:59,615
you might have only have twenty but

1610
00:53:59,615 --> 00:54:00,995
god i think you should do twenty

1611
00:54:00,995 --> 00:54:03,755
because everyone has to be shifting there's

1612
00:54:03,785 --> 00:54:05,645
yeah well let's see why but you

1613
00:54:05,645 --> 00:54:07,535
get twenty for each person yeah yeah

1614
00:54:07,685 --> 00:54:09,395
yeah oh yeah twenty breach oh wow

1615
00:54:09,425 --> 00:54:12,245
so forty questions essentially okay but everyone's

1616
00:54:12,245 --> 00:54:14,375
thinking at the same time yeah like

1617
00:54:14,375 --> 00:54:15,635
we each have like yeah let's do

1618
00:54:15,635 --> 00:54:16,595
it and see how long it takes

1619
00:54:16,595 --> 00:54:18,095
okay so maybe we've already seen the

1620
00:54:18,155 --> 00:54:19,775
twenty free thanks of a thing yeah

1621
00:54:19,775 --> 00:54:21,215
so lauren you and i think of

1622
00:54:21,215 --> 00:54:22,775
the thing and paul will guess oh

1623
00:54:22,775 --> 00:54:24,515
look alright well that makes it easy

1624
00:54:24,515 --> 00:54:25,925
for me wait but but there's not

1625
00:54:25,925 --> 00:54:27,695
three people playing yeah but he's going

1626
00:54:27,695 --> 00:54:29,225
i guess and we're each thinking of

1627
00:54:29,225 --> 00:54:32,045
two separate things okay okay okay okay

1628
00:54:32,075 --> 00:54:33,935
okay okay i thought it was that

1629
00:54:33,935 --> 00:54:35,560
we each three would have our own

1630
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:37,625
and though he doesn't he doesn't know

1631
00:54:37,655 --> 00:54:38,825
he doesn't think of him but at

1632
00:54:38,825 --> 00:54:40,085
the end we all say the thing

1633
00:54:40,205 --> 00:54:41,495
yeah okay okay so just think of

1634
00:54:41,495 --> 00:54:41,795
the thing

1635
00:54:43,505 --> 00:54:45,425
is it a and who's this too

1636
00:54:45,605 --> 00:54:47,795
but this i'm looking at lauren okay

1637
00:54:49,595 --> 00:54:50,915
excuse me for trying to help the

1638
00:54:50,915 --> 00:54:52,835
