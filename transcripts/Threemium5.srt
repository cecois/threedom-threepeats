an i-pad that she put a little

45
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:45,870
fun you can't really call it a

46
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:48,870
computer because it doesn't really compute anything

47
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:50,970

put your social security number yeah to

87
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:12,745

00:03:12,745 --> 00:03:13,800
yeah this guy

89
00:03:13,954 --> 00:03:15,840
is he's not even named chris i

90
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,880
bet i bet he's something like christopher

91
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:18,360
or something

92
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:21,150
ah he may not even have a

93
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:23,880
gig he might if he doesn't forget

94
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,800
i bet they don't have teeth well

95
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,880
you know what i love that story

96
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,830
that i love the un genuity their

97
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:31,830
expressed by new and used like a

98
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:33,330
roger new eddie

99
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:37,500
that was a wonderful story do you

100
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,590
think that that there are fish that

101
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:42,480
are good fathers like in finding nemo

102
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:43,680
where they care about i don't think

103
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:45,060
i think that about nature all the

104
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:47,400
time like is there a maternal instincts

105
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,800
i guess they always put it on

106
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,780
animals but i think they would kill

107
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:54,210
anyone for for a potato they don't

108
00:03:54,990 --> 00:04:02,040
ah it's funny that they protect them

109
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,080
when they're little right and then they're

110
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,430
like you're on your own you can't

111
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:06,150
get out of here what are you

112
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:07,800
still doing here yeah i don't want

113
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,210
to be around you like cats don't

114
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:11,610
live together forever yeah i think that

115
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:13,230
about like sometimes i was like with

116
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:14,280
our dogs i was like

117
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:17,190
would it be because we know where

118
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:20,820
some of george's siblings are would it

119
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:22,860
be fun for them to see each

120
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,540
other i don't think it would mean

121
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:25,800
anything i know

122
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:29,220

124
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:31,920

frozen the sound so good but was

268
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:45,660
that not a thing that you could

269
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,340
buy and you could heat up in

270
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:49,380

of the charges sixteen for the heat

275
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:59,130
i'm suspicious of this

276
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:01,440
yeah i'm suspicious of this story i

277
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,029
feel like you're lying to all eyes

278
00:10:03,029 --> 00:10:04,740
and i don't know why hey maybe

279
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:06,750
i am maybe some hotels you can

280
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:09,750
get like microwavable meals yeah it's not

281
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:14,280
ah okay okay but they didn't reveal

282
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,660
the hotel that's the part i was

283
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:18,436
suspicious and this was a celebrity and

284
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,440
this was the hotel

285
00:10:20,755 --> 00:10:21,565
i'd never heard of her i don't

286
00:10:21,565 --> 00:10:23,125
know you never heard of her and

287
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:24,835
the husband was the bloodhound in this

288
00:10:24,835 --> 00:10:26,695
instance they showed a picture of the

289
00:10:27,055 --> 00:10:29,245
room service being revealed and they showed

290
00:10:29,245 --> 00:10:30,835
a picture of the stuff in the

291
00:10:30,835 --> 00:10:32,065
fridge and it was the exact same

292
00:10:34,195 --> 00:10:35,515
what they said the presentation was really

293
00:10:35,515 --> 00:10:36,295
good and it was good

294
00:10:37,435 --> 00:10:39,505
so were they complaining but no because

295
00:10:39,505 --> 00:10:42,265
the hotel claimed to have all handmade

296
00:10:42,295 --> 00:10:44,395
