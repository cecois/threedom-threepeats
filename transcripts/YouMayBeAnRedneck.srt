00:11:23,165 --> 00:11:24,785
people are survival and they go in

304
00:11:24,785 --> 00:11:27,335
by themselves to get loans yes and

305
00:11:27,335 --> 00:11:29,495

309
00:11:35,885 --> 00:11:38,615
he'll say bag so we started with

310
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:40,775
season six because the internet so that

311
00:11:40,775 --> 00:11:41,855
was like one of the most exciting

312
00:11:41,855 --> 00:11:43,925
seasons don't you want to stay and

313
00:11:43,925 --> 00:11:45,425
work up to it because now nothing

314
00:11:45,425 --> 00:11:47,855
will match season six no we just

315
00:11:47,855 --> 00:11:50,315
watched we're watching past that now basically

316
00:11:50,525 --> 00:11:51,245
see season

317
00:11:51,275 --> 00:11:53,915
six it's on hulu um but people

318
00:11:53,915 --> 00:11:57,725
are surviving alone in the arctic and

319
00:11:57,755 --> 00:11:59,435
for as long as they can and

320
00:11:59,465 --> 00:12:00,665
you are they're all in different ways

321
00:12:00,815 --> 00:12:03,305
like forty five minutes home before they

322
00:12:03,305 --> 00:12:04,775
tap out know i mean these people

323
00:12:04,775 --> 00:12:06,335
go a long time some people don't

324
00:12:06,335 --> 00:12:07,685
last long because they're not naked they're

325
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:09,695
clothed and alone they are clothing alone

326
00:12:09,695 --> 00:12:11,405
how clothed warm

327
00:12:11,405 --> 00:12:14,015
no winter clothes but like underneath g

328
00:12:14,015 --> 00:12:16,805
strings yeah they have g strings underneath

329
00:12:16,835 --> 00:12:18,215
and tidied tassels

330
00:12:21,215 --> 00:12:24,815
and it's so that's mandatory so you

331
00:12:24,815 --> 00:12:27,215
only see that when there many women

332
00:12:27,245 --> 00:12:29,885
there plus um but it's really great

333
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:31,925
and one person wins at the end

334
00:12:31,925 --> 00:12:33,275
but they don't know if they're being

335
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:34,415
so it's a group of people they're

336
00:12:34,415 --> 00:12:36,275
all in separate places they have no

337
00:12:36,275 --> 00:12:37,565
idea what's going on with anyone else

338
00:12:37,595 --> 00:12:38,465
and you're just trying to go as

339
00:12:38,465 --> 00:12:39,485
long as we know

340
00:12:39,485 --> 00:12:41,585
oh so do when the when the

341
00:12:41,585 --> 00:12:43,505
second last person drops out do they

342
00:12:43,505 --> 00:12:45,095
tell the first person like oh hey

343
00:12:45,095 --> 00:12:47,045
that person dropped out or do they

344
00:12:47,045 --> 00:12:48,906
just see how do they never tell

345
00:12:48,906 --> 00:12:50,195
that they go no they don't make

346
00:12:50,195 --> 00:12:51,335
them go too long they just go

347
00:12:51,335 --> 00:12:52,714
right when that person leaves they go

348
00:12:52,714 --> 00:12:54,065
over to germany i think it'd be

349
00:12:54,065 --> 00:12:56,195
funny like someone drops out three days

350
00:12:56,195 --> 00:12:58,608
in and then another twenty seven days

351
00:12:58,608 --> 00:12:59,645
and honestly might be a key

352
00:12:59,645 --> 00:13:01,445
couple days later because one of the

353
00:13:01,445 --> 00:13:03,425
things that happens is they bring out

354
00:13:03,485 --> 00:13:05,825
a member of their family to surprise

355
00:13:05,825 --> 00:13:08,255
them and say like you won oh

356
00:13:08,285 --> 00:13:10,235
and so i always surprised even though

357
00:13:10,235 --> 00:13:12,215
there's multiple seasons while i've only seen

358
00:13:12,215 --> 00:13:13,355
the ending of one season so i

359
00:13:13,355 --> 00:13:15,815
don't know um but the surprise would

360
00:13:15,815 --> 00:13:16,985
be you don't know that they're coming

361
00:13:16,985 --> 00:13:18,035
because you don't know that you won

362
00:13:18,245 --> 00:13:19,805
right so like you're hoping

363
00:13:19,805 --> 00:13:21,005
and every day that that would happen

364
00:13:21,005 --> 00:13:22,325
to you but it's alright it's probably

365
00:13:22,355 --> 00:13:23,373
not going to so you just have

366
00:13:23,373 --> 00:13:25,715
to keep working shooting beavers so fucking

367
00:13:26,195 --> 00:13:28,115
nowhere on season nine being working shooting

368
00:13:28,115 --> 00:13:31,505
beavers another inch obese canada somewhere in

369
00:13:31,505 --> 00:13:33,995
season nine you think easy versus the

370
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:36,875
the balloon verse oh but the point

371

541
00:19:30,035 --> 00:19:31,145
god because it's the only thing i

542
00:19:31,145 --> 00:19:33,095
know so were you shocked when scanned

543
00:19:33,095 --> 00:19:35,675
of all happened well obviously we were

544
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:37,685
going into it looking for signs of

545
00:19:37,685 --> 00:19:39,185
what it would be right right which

546
00:19:39,185 --> 00:19:40,618
they then had to edit where

547
00:19:40,685 --> 00:19:42,245
you write or episodes of the show

548
00:19:42,275 --> 00:19:44,615
where are you right i had two

549
00:19:44,645 --> 00:19:46,565
possibilities and one of them was right

550
00:19:46,565 --> 00:19:50,075
it was not specifically that person oh

551
00:19:50,315 --> 00:19:51,845
so you're not doing that protecting anyone

552
00:19:51,845 --> 00:19:53,015
knew it had to be mandible the

553
00:19:53,015 --> 00:19:56,315
names i knew santa always involved probably

554
00:19:56,315 --> 00:19:58,211
because of the name scandal that was

555
00:19:58,385 --> 00:19:59,525
that was my first clue i was

556
00:19:59,525 --> 00:20:00,845
like it can't be that easy yeah

557
00:20:00,885 --> 00:20:01,775
and then it turned out it was

558
00:20:02,255 --> 00:20:05,915
due your eyes but i um i

559
00:20:05,945 --> 00:20:08,975
did call that he had an affair

560
00:20:09,215 --> 00:20:11,855
that was like an off-camera affair did

561
00:20:11,855 --> 00:20:12,575
you think i thought it would be

562
00:20:12,575 --> 00:20:15,215
producers something i thought it was i

563
00:20:15,245 --> 00:20:16,415
thought it was maybe somebody that we

564
00:20:16,415 --> 00:20:18,395
had knots that somebody was not involved

565
00:20:18,395 --> 00:20:20,105
in the show right right oh but

566
00:20:20,105 --> 00:20:21,005
i knew there was something i knew

567
00:20:21,655 --> 00:20:22,313
well i mean i thought it was

568
00:20:22,313 --> 00:20:24,235
either that or that he fucked over

569
00:20:24,355 --> 00:20:26,995
his business partner oh i remember somebody

570
00:20:27,025 --> 00:20:28,195
they will never do that made a

571
00:20:28,195 --> 00:20:29,725
thing that was like comparing it if

572
00:20:29,725 --> 00:20:32,035
you don't watch the show it's like

573
00:20:32,065 --> 00:20:35,755
if um obama was secretly having an

574
00:20:35,755 --> 00:20:39,145
affair with joe biden that's how close

575
00:20:39,145 --> 00:20:41,275
likewise like billy like if bill clinton

576
00:20:41,275 --> 00:20:41,748
had an

577
00:20:41,785 --> 00:20:43,045
affair with an intern or so oh

578
00:20:43,045 --> 00:20:44,245
my god that would be insane

579
00:20:45,475 --> 00:20:46,975
any journey was a great friend of

580
00:20:47,095 --> 00:20:49,015
hillary clinton what if they were best

581
00:20:49,015 --> 00:20:51,415
friends but anyway that that is bad

582
00:20:51,415 --> 00:20:53,815
as the edible that is ah so

583
00:20:53,815 --> 00:20:55,825
we are you're happy we're not completely

584
00:20:55,825 --> 00:20:59,305
done we're halfway through congratulation reunion episode

585
00:20:59,305 --> 00:21:01,576
and then the learns onto the third

586
00:21:01,585 --> 00:21:03,235
then you'll be all caught wanting to

587
00:21:03,235 --> 00:21:05,515
do yeah watch other tv

588
00:21:05,545 --> 00:21:07,825
shows really yeah we really put the

589
00:21:07,825 --> 00:21:09,535
time in we would call it good

590
00:21:09,535 --> 00:21:10,675
job and we would say back to

591
00:21:10,675 --> 00:21:11,875
work i watched a tv show that

592
00:21:11,875 --> 00:21:13,315
i won't promote and i'll tell you

593
00:21:13,315 --> 00:21:14,515
what it was later but i was

594
00:21:14,515 --> 00:21:17,095
really enjoying it and then the ending

595
00:21:17,095 --> 00:21:19,135
of the season was in the middle

596
00:21:19,135 --> 00:21:21,655
of a climactic moment where which is

597
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:22,525
how the show had been working at

598
00:21:22,525 --> 00:21:23,725
the end of every episode like oh

599
00:21:23,725 --> 00:21:24,805
big thing happens then you want to

600
00:21:24,805 --> 00:21:25,645
get clutching yeah

601
00:21:25,765 --> 00:21:27,715
and just ended and i'm like i'm

602
00:21:27,715 --> 00:21:29,455
never do you're not gonna you're not

603
00:21:29,455 --> 00:21:31,375
gonna get another season or it's going

604
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:32,605
to be two years till i get

605
00:21:32,605 --> 00:21:34,195
to see what happens next tv shows

606
00:21:34,195 --> 00:21:36,445
enough enough with the trying to tease

607
00:21:36,445 --> 00:21:39,175
of future me like some sort of

608
00:21:39,175 --> 00:21:41,271
ending then i will want more yeah

609
00:21:41,313 --> 00:21:43,285
i like still like just give me

610
00:21:43,285 --> 00:21:44,395
some sort of like and then this

611
00:21:44,425 --> 00:21:45,865
habit i think like early

612
00:21:45,865 --> 00:21:48,835
the on in vanderpump there was either

613
00:21:48,835 --> 00:21:50,035
like at the end of the second

614
00:21:50,035 --> 00:21:53,155
or third season it definitely ended like

615
00:21:53,155 --> 00:21:55,285
a series finale or there like it

616
00:21:55,285 --> 00:21:56,875
doesn't look good for us and then

617
00:21:57,325 --> 00:21:59,065
they've all worked yeah but like the

618
00:21:59,065 --> 00:22:02,545
way they're reminiscing or whatever every third

619
00:22:02,545 --> 00:22:04,405
day show does that now where it's

620
00:22:04,405 --> 00:22:06,025
like they end the season with

621
00:22:06,025 --> 00:22:07,855
not resolving the story they've been telling

622
00:22:07,855 --> 00:22:09,865
yeah it's like resolve this one story

623
00:22:10,015 --> 00:22:11,395
maybe give a hint or something like

624
00:22:11,395 --> 00:22:13,195
right yeah have something like oh there's

625
00:22:13,195 --> 00:22:15,145
more but this guy could go to

626
00:22:15,145 --> 00:22:17,305
but but it's it's better when it's

627
00:22:17,335 --> 00:22:19,225
more like justified seasons where it just

628
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:20,605
ends the story you're telling and then

629
00:22:20,605 --> 00:22:22,165
like the next season you can pick

630
00:22:22,165 --> 00:22:23,395
up on a new story i've never

631
00:22:23,455 --> 00:22:25,525

632
00:22:25,525 --> 00:22:26,065

00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:55,200
positive stories from people but they had

922
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,340
also like the group that i'm in

923
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:58,020
also recommended like this other place

924
00:32:58,350 --> 00:33:00,210
that some people were saying hit or

925
00:33:00,210 --> 00:33:01,560
miss with certain people and then my

926
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:03,030
friend went ahead to this other place

927
00:33:03,030 --> 00:33:04,290
and had a horrible experience with her

928
00:33:04,290 --> 00:33:06,120
child where they like pinning him down

929
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,770
and like wouldn't stop screaming and stuff

930
00:33:08,130 --> 00:33:10,140
and her they was very traumatizing them

931
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:12,900
and i the place that i took

932
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:14,490
holly was delightful she had a great

933
00:33:14,490 --> 00:33:15,330
time she talks about it all the

934
00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:16,770
time really she wants to go back

935
00:33:16,770 --> 00:33:18,030
she like thinks it's great

936
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:19,140
like it was like they have a

937
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:21,360
tv on the ceiling playing bluey as

938
00:33:21,390 --> 00:33:22,950
so when the kids laying back that's

939
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:24,870
good and the parent holds the child

940
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:26,040
when i could just put a tv

941
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,720
on my own ceiling and play blues

942
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:29,008
but are you gonna clean your tv

um and then the dentist and his

945
00:33:32,730 --> 00:33:34,710

wow so yeah she she did not

954
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:48,690
like the first time we brushed your

955
00:33:48,690 --> 00:33:50,310

956
00:33:50,610 --> 00:33:51,720
i showed her that i would do

957
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,309
it with my own brush and would

958
00:33:53,309 --> 00:33:54,870
go brush fresh fresh fresh fresh fresh

959
00:33:54,870 --> 00:33:56,340
and then she would smile and so

960
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:57,660
now she likes to she gets very

961
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:59,940
excited when it comes out and shavasana

962
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:01,500
she brushes her teeth yeah but so

963
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:02,550
i'm trying we're trying to do that

964
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:03,840
with dennis my mom is telling me

965
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:05,190
the other day that that i just

966
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:07,560
hated any dentist or doctor yeah or

967
00:34:07,564 --> 00:34:09,390
anything but i i was wondering this

968
00:34:09,390 --> 00:34:10,494
paul do you feel this way

969
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:12,270
i'm on the spot because we're we're

970
00:34:12,270 --> 00:34:13,350
the same age this is the reason

971
00:34:13,350 --> 00:34:15,330
i direct it might be the same

972
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:16,530
it might be the same thing i'm

973
00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:18,480
only here what it is but i

974
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,070
feel a lot of literature when we

975
00:34:20,070 --> 00:34:21,870
were kids and a lot of tv

976
00:34:21,870 --> 00:34:23,580
shows like they had a lot of

977
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:25,950
stuff about the dentist and the doctor

978
00:34:25,950 --> 00:34:28,650
like getting shots and getting cavities drilled

979
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:30,750
yeah and instilled like a fear of

980
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:30,900
these

981
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:32,850
most places yeah when really you're just

982
00:34:32,850 --> 00:34:34,560
going to get like you know your

983
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,300
teeth cleaned or stuff that doesn't really

984
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:37,500
hurt all that much most of the

985
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:40,020
time yeah but i mean but then

986
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:41,910
as a kid you do get cavities

987
00:34:41,970 --> 00:34:44,250
and then it fucking sucks yeah and

988
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:45,660
you know that i've never i actually

989
00:34:45,690 --> 00:34:47,820
never had a cavity until i was

990
00:34:47,850 --> 00:34:50,850
twenty seven or something budget for you

991
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:50,970
but

992
00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:52,950
so why was i so afraid where

993
00:34:52,950 --> 00:34:54,270
i was like my mom would have

994
00:34:54,270 --> 00:34:57,300
to bribe me well some fifty thousand

995
00:34:57,300 --> 00:35:00,540
dollars sharing tools in your mouth and

996
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:01,650
all that stuff it's kind of like

997
00:35:01,830 --> 00:35:03,720
it's kind of creepy it sucks yeah

998
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:05,310
i don't like things i don't like

999
00:35:05,310 --> 00:35:08,250
going yeah yeah ah but i um

1000
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:10,890
i i remember we had a we

1001
00:35:10,890 --> 00:35:11,220
had a dent

1002
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:12,360
just as a kid who did not

1003
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,970
i remember him drilling my tube drill

1004
00:35:14,970 --> 00:35:17,790
baby drill and it hurt so much

1005
00:35:17,970 --> 00:35:19,770
because i don't think he gave anesthetic

1006
00:35:20,010 --> 00:35:21,750
oh i think maybe he was going

1007
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:23,370
to and then maybe i fought against

1008
00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:24,720
having a needle put in my mouth

1009
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:27,030
i don't know but i do remember

1010
00:35:27,570 --> 00:35:29,190
or maybe he did and it didn't

1011
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:30,510
take i mean all i can remember

1012
00:35:30,510 --> 00:35:31,380
is the fucking

1013
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:31,590
ng

1014
00:35:33,330 --> 00:35:37,290
crazy pain yeah of having my tooth

1015
00:35:37,290 --> 00:35:39,990
drilled into it's horrible it was insane

1016
00:35:40,350 --> 00:35:41,340
my mom had to get a root

1017
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:42,690
canal and she was pregnant with me

1018
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:45,630

that's rough yeah yeah wow how how

1023
00:35:56,029 --> 00:35:58,530
far along i don't know it's just

1024

i guess just a story i've heard

1025
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:01,290

1026
00:36:01,290 --> 00:36:02,970

1039
00:36:26,010 --> 00:36:27,780
extremely like as a kid that coopers

1048
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:38,310

1049
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:39,900
a really sounds like thanks here to

1052
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:43,410

another song that people can work on

1261
00:45:52,955 --> 00:45:54,335
okay if they want to this is

1262
00:45:54,335 --> 00:45:56,285
to replace randy newman singing you've got

1263
00:45:56,285 --> 00:45:58,175
a friend in me not to replace

1264
00:45:58,175 --> 00:46:00,335
randy newman we love that randy's show

1265
00:46:00,682 --> 00:46:02,315
so i don't have that power i

1266
00:46:02,315 --> 00:46:03,155
don't have that power

1267
00:46:04,235 --> 00:46:06,322
but if i did let me be

1268
00:46:06,322 --> 00:46:07,985
using gone there would be a lot

1269
00:46:07,985 --> 00:46:10,595
of people that short people song what

1270
00:46:10,595 --> 00:46:12,695
about it was so good because from

1271
00:46:12,695 --> 00:46:15,035
nineteen so many wow i'm just wondering

1272
00:46:15,065 --> 00:46:17,645
what is obviously a joke but i'm

1273
00:46:17,645 --> 00:46:19,445
like yes why like i just am

1274
00:46:19,445 --> 00:46:22,025
curious why he's just like ah i

1275
00:46:22,055 --> 00:46:23,975
think it's a satirical take on like

1276
00:46:23,975 --> 00:46:24,365
we keep

1277
00:46:24,395 --> 00:46:26,825
finding new reasons to hate people oh

1278
00:46:26,825 --> 00:46:29,165
okay yes a satirical take on bigotry

1279
00:46:29,165 --> 00:46:31,145
in that it's ah just a random

1280
00:46:31,145 --> 00:46:32,885
thing it's it doesn't make any sense

1281
00:46:32,885 --> 00:46:35,015
to hate people for these for these

1282
00:46:35,015 --> 00:46:37,085
reasons yeah and he's saying what if

1283

this game is called celebrity hunt we

1509
00:54:32,620 --> 00:54:33,549
haven't played it in a while i

1510
00:54:33,692 --> 00:54:35,380
have played in a while now the

1511
00:54:35,380 --> 00:54:37,360
way it works yeah is one person

1512
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:38,920
will say a celebrities name we all

1513
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:40,480
say hunt together because we're on the

1514
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:42,490
hunt and the first question is first

1515
00:54:42,490 --> 00:54:43,480
person is forced

1516
00:54:43,510 --> 00:54:45,850

be the first person to start it's

1521
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:52,000
really a tough position to be in

1522
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,650
yeah but then the next person has

1523
00:54:53,650 --> 00:54:54,850
to say a celebrity that starts with

1524
00:54:54,850 --> 00:54:56,710
the last letter of the previous celebrity's

1525
00:54:56,710 --> 00:54:58,600
name that's right and it's a celebrity
