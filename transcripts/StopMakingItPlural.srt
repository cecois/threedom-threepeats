movies that has a female protagonist true

222
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,960

it's interesting because like a scare crow

224
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,530
came to light oh well like i

225
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:36,450
don't know i never noticed that lion

226
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:38,580

00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:45,060
hey you didn't even have a heart

230
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:48,660
when you think of that movie came

231
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:50,160
out now you'd be noted to death

232
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,900
by the studio like it's well it's

233
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:54,240
a strangely structural and then they did

234
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,130
that um oh no that that wasn't

235
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:57,510
like updated i guess they did the

236
00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:00,090
ways that live went on ah oh

237
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:01,590
yea oh yeah did you watch i

238
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:03,570
did i watch all those i lie

239
00:09:03,577 --> 00:09:06,120
watched them all up but but about

240
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:06,240
how

241
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,770
half of them i stopped midway through

242
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:09,330
saying oh this is no good i

243
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:12,300
enjoy when it's bad really um i

244
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,770
enjoyed the first one the sound of

245
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:16,080
music that was terrible i remember like

246
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,990
i think we all gathered together at

247
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:21,160
like sarah silverman's house or something because

248
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:22,080
he's was the first one in a

249
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,250
long time and we were out we

250
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:25,170
all love musicals like come on over

251
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:26,400
and then within three minutes

252
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:27,390
i was like oh this is a

253
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:29,070
bomb yeah look like a soap opera

254
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:31,830
one sometimes they're really strange when they

255
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:33,150
don't i think most of them don't

256
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:34,560
have an audience and i find that

257
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,570
really weird yeah because it's like this

258
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:38,220
reminds me of like those ones you'd

259
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:40,080
watch growing up but like it's weird

260
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,460
like it just seems like yeah silo

261
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:44,910
fox live yeah like oh wow yeah

262
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:46,530

265
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:51,180
audience and people cheering you know like

266
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:52,410

267
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:53,910

the show um i don't know i

294
00:10:46,255 --> 00:10:47,785

295
00:10:47,785 --> 00:10:50,845
at my school really interesting yeah i

296
00:10:50,845 --> 00:10:52,405
wonder why that is right where you

297
00:10:52,405 --> 00:10:56,245
are you an introvert um no but

298
00:10:56,245 --> 00:10:57,535
i you know i thought

299
00:10:57,535 --> 00:10:58,855
think part of it my school had

300
00:10:58,855 --> 00:11:00,535
just like a lot of like really

301
00:11:00,535 --> 00:11:01,945
good actors and people who are really

302
00:11:01,945 --> 00:11:05,125
like obsessed with musical theatre and stuff

303
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:06,835
but they were just great but i

304
00:11:06,835 --> 00:11:08,005
always do we talk about this before

305
00:11:08,005 --> 00:11:09,445
because i really want to watch like

306
00:11:09,445 --> 00:11:11,215
videos with high school plays and see

307
00:11:11,215 --> 00:11:12,745
if they were actually yeah we talked

308
00:11:12,745 --> 00:11:14,005
about this a little bit about yeah

309
00:11:14,005 --> 00:11:16,195
they're they're all we imagine them as

310
00:11:16,195 --> 00:11:17,695
these great productions but they are

311
00:11:17,695 --> 00:11:20,605
probably all were terrible i know um

312
00:11:20,905 --> 00:11:22,555
the way we are transmitting before this

313
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:26,545
ah okay let's bash through time just

314
00:11:26,545 --> 00:11:28,015
talking about those musicals i love sitting

315
00:11:28,015 --> 00:11:29,575
down and watching like a live event

316
00:11:29,575 --> 00:11:30,775
and i love award shows for that

317
00:11:30,775 --> 00:11:32,215
same reason and yet i invited you

318
00:11:32,245 --> 00:11:35,275

322
00:11:40,585 --> 00:11:42,415
real answer as to whether you were

323
00:11:42,415 --> 00:11:44,665

324
00:11:44,665 --> 00:11:46,135
we didn't watch by the time it

325
00:11:46,135 --> 00:11:47,965

00:13:16,225 --> 00:13:17,785
especially if i'm if i'm betting on

374
00:13:17,785 --> 00:13:19,285
them then i'm will see this is

375
00:13:19,285 --> 00:13:21,085
fun stephanie allen was just telling me

376
00:13:21,085 --> 00:13:23,695
about how she bet on the bills

377
00:13:23,725 --> 00:13:25,285
and they are known to lose all

378
00:13:25,285 --> 00:13:26,965
the time but they were doing whatever

379
00:13:26,965 --> 00:13:27,835
she bet on them and she would

380
00:13:27,835 --> 00:13:30,175
have stood to win thirty thousand doll

381
00:13:30,175 --> 00:13:31,495
oilers if they won the super bowl

382
00:13:31,675 --> 00:13:31,975
well

383
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:36,110
hey just passing hundred dollars oh yeah

384
00:13:36,205 --> 00:13:38,065
the odds are so stacked against right

385
00:13:38,245 --> 00:13:39,745
right um but i was like i

386
00:13:39,745 --> 00:13:41,485
got a gamble i gotta get on

387
00:13:41,485 --> 00:13:43,495
this and that makes sport seem fun

388
00:13:43,495 --> 00:13:45,265
to me it's ironic that she bet

389
00:13:45,265 --> 00:13:46,162
on the bills and she would have

390
00:13:46,162 --> 00:13:48,835
won so many bills yeah isn't it

391
00:13:48,895 --> 00:13:52,435
yeah run it's like oh i do

392
00:13:52,435 --> 00:13:53,215
not like to gamba

393
00:13:53,215 --> 00:13:55,375

00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:04,525
like i don't spend a lotta money

399
00:14:04,525 --> 00:14:05,665
but i can see the odds the

400
00:14:05,665 --> 00:14:07,345
terrible odds making it kind of exciting

401
00:14:07,345 --> 00:14:09,535

402
00:14:09,655 --> 00:14:11,545

typically will never win like anytime i've

406
00:14:17,635 --> 00:14:19,255
come i've i've had moments where i'm

407
00:14:19,255 --> 00:14:21,355
like way above what i came in

408
00:14:21,355 --> 00:14:23,425
with but that rose at all but

409
00:14:23,455 --> 00:14:24,895
it's i just chalk it up to

410
00:14:24,895 --> 00:14:26,005
like i got to play a game

411
00:14:26,005 --> 00:14:28,645

a few tons of gambles

415
00:14:33,565 --> 00:14:35,635
like when i am losing the money

416
00:14:35,785 --> 00:14:37,810
it feels so bad and it makes

417
00:14:37,825 --> 00:14:39,685
me so anxious like what am i

419
00:14:42,055 --> 00:14:43,495
is crazy when you play a game

420
00:14:43,495 --> 00:14:45,265
like roulette because i go in there

421
00:14:45,265 --> 00:14:46,765

this as long as i can and

424
00:14:49,195 --> 00:14:50,815
then there'll be people who are just

425
00:14:51,535 --> 00:14:53,425
just throwing down so much money and

426
00:14:53,425 --> 00:14:53,695
losing

427
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:55,015
it's so fast and it makes me

428
00:14:55,015 --> 00:14:57,742
feel insane like watching them yeah i'm

429
00:14:57,742 --> 00:14:59,425
like what is wrong with you like

430
00:14:59,425 --> 00:15:01,405
that's crazy because it's the worst game

431
00:15:01,405 --> 00:15:02,725
if you actually want to win like

432
00:15:02,845 --> 00:15:04,675
a shit ton of money yeah this

433
00:15:04,675 --> 00:15:05,755
guy was saying so this guy he

434
00:15:05,755 --> 00:15:07,045
was just putting down one hundred bucks

435
00:15:07,045 --> 00:15:09,655
like every time and it was just

436
00:15:09,745 --> 00:15:11,485
like he was spending thousands and thousands

437
00:15:11,485 --> 00:15:12,805
of dollars time and then he kept

438
00:15:12,835 --> 00:15:13,825
like you get like

439
00:15:13,855 --> 00:15:14,725
i have a flight to catch a

440
00:15:14,725 --> 00:15:16,735

out outta here and then like just

443
00:15:19,495 --> 00:15:21,565
kept going and then he'd walk away

444
00:15:21,565 --> 00:15:22,735
and they go oh and come back

445
00:15:22,735 --> 00:15:24,805
and put on like a serious gambling

446
00:15:24,805 --> 00:15:27,385
problem it was really upsetting a gambling

447
00:15:27,415 --> 00:15:30,745
problem a gambling addiction seems so horrifying

448
00:15:30,745 --> 00:15:32,185
to me like even more than a

449
00:15:32,185 --> 00:15:33,595
drug addiction for some reason i don't

450
00:15:33,595 --> 00:15:33,955
know if it's

451
00:15:34,015 --> 00:15:36,055
just the i guess it's just the

452
00:15:36,085 --> 00:15:37,975
i guess with the anxiety because the

453
00:15:37,975 --> 00:15:40,285
drug addiction you know what you're getting

454
00:15:40,315 --> 00:15:41,905
well it's just not it's not like

455
00:15:41,905 --> 00:15:43,759
you're gonna i mean yeah it's also

456
00:15:43,975 --> 00:15:46,045
it's a physical thing yeah it's like

457
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:48,625
you are ah you at least know

458
00:15:48,625 --> 00:15:50,485
you will get the respite of the

459
00:15:50,485 --> 00:15:51,985
drug i guess if you can get

460
00:15:51,985 --> 00:15:53,905
the well i know people who are

461
00:15:53,935 --> 00:15:54,175
x

462
00:15:54,175 --> 00:15:56,635
ks drug addicts alcoholics who are now

463
00:15:56,665 --> 00:15:58,525
gambling at it yeah i know because

464
00:15:58,525 --> 00:16:00,715
it's just another way to yeah which

465
00:16:00,925 --> 00:16:02,204
i get in some ways saver but

466
00:16:02,215 --> 00:16:03,355
in other ways you're losing all your

467
00:16:03,355 --> 00:16:06,445
money and it's not just the anxiety

468
00:16:06,445 --> 00:16:07,615
of it i know it makes me

469
00:16:07,615 --> 00:16:09,055

finally the most dangerous games now the

1081
00:39:10,830 --> 00:39:14,010
so basically during lloyd brixton will say

1082
00:39:14,790 --> 00:39:16,380
isn't it easy bill lloyd bridges had

1083
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:18,060
a show called ceyhan yeah if you

00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:19,230
just like and they got away with

1085
00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:21,000
it yeah boy because we all know

1086
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,620
what he was hunting yeah okay the

1087
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:24,420
one person will see a celebrities name

1088
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:26,850
name then we'll all say hunt right

1089
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,830
then the next person says a celebrities

1090
00:39:28,830 --> 00:39:30,390
name that starts with the last letter

1091
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:32,820
of the previous celebrity's name okay and

1092
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:33,750
how did and then we all say

1093
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:36,300
hunt until someone tells someone just so

1094
00:39:36,390 --> 00:39:38,040
what i try to keep giving go

1095
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,750
faster and faster also we could add

1096
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:41,250
a wrinkle where you have to say

1097
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:43,890
living people and if you say oh

1098
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:44,580
if you say dead

1099
00:39:44,610 --> 00:39:46,320
per se and then i also think

1100
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,210
no one say dolores o'riordan if it's

1101
00:39:48,270 --> 00:39:51,150
