would say started because i was just

87
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:21,210
thinking the slow day i speaking up

88
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:24,240
hiding things i had gotten that same

89
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,260
year when i was in fifth grade

90
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:26,610
i got like all of these books

91
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:28,410
about angels out of the library because

92
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:29,040
i was very

93
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:31,436
curious about them sure and i believed

94
00:03:31,436 --> 00:03:32,520
in them and then the book started

95
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,630
to scare me so much that i

96
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:35,310
hid all the books in my closet

97
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,230
oh and like didn't return them for

98
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:38,160
a long time then i was really

99
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,840
worried about the fees it was turned

100
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,860
into like a whole thing so you

101
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:43,230
were scared of of the possibility of

102
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:44,760
angel i like you gloss over that

103
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,170
you believed in them i was very

104
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:48,090
curious about them because i believe in

105
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:49,200
them and

106
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:51,660
i had such a belief in them

107
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:54,330
i want to learn more than i

108
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:56,340

what did you do you remember what

110
00:03:57,450 --> 00:03:58,530
it was that you learned that i

111
00:03:58,530 --> 00:03:59,943

245
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,760
suitcase yeah you didn't have a backpack

think i think we kept everything at

250
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:43,080
school oh i don't think we had

251
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:43,920
homework until

253
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:49,110
homework when they're seven so i didn't

254
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:50,700
have homework till junior high i think

255
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:52,860
which is why which is why my

256
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,680
grades my grades were great through elementary

257
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,450
school and the minute there was homework

258
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,000
i started getting work until junior high

259
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,744
i don't think so i remember i

260
00:09:01,773 --> 00:09:03,090
still like it was always homework yeah

261
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,080
know that

262
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,280
we we would do stuff like you'd

263
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,690
get a project or something you had

264
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:08,010
to do at home occasionally but it

265
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:09,420
wasn't like every single night you had

266
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:10,650
to or maybe had to read a

267
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:13,050
book or whatever i hate projects i

268
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:14,820
hate project i grew up in them

269
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:15,096
so

270
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:18,900
the idea just looking out of the

271
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:22,710
window watching me as a whole group

272
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:28,590
oh lordy mahoney shut up ah the

273
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:30,180

275
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,400

so that you do a little bit

280
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,850
at a time i would always be

281
00:09:41,868 --> 00:09:43,080

282
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,150

00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:44,050
and it's a totally different person oh

374
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:44,980
you think there's a lot of that

375
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:46,780
yeah yeah yeah i guess it depends

376
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:48,100
on how much money you are paying

377
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:49,780
and i think that if you are

378
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:51,640
if if it's like la weekly the

379
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,260
less you pay the better you get

380
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:56,950
and really because they're hungrier for

381
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:01,330
but i mean it's like if you're

382
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:03,760
if you're paying a lot of money

383
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:06,400
like high-end call girls or whatever i

384
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,020
don't know you would probably be able

385
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:10,060
to order very specifically this is what

386
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:11,710
i want and you'd be happy with

387
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:13,630
i had a i had a friend

388
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:14,860
and i'm sure they have like pictures

389
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:16,690
online and yeah now it's probably more

390
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:18,220
yeah me saying all this ri

391
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:20,380

392
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:25,180

as i was talking to my friend

403
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:47,110
i realized she just thought that i

404
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:49,060
was asking for ice huh you know

405
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:51,640

look them up no no not them

407
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:55,450
up oh you just got the information

408
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:56,650
you just wanted to know like how

409
00:13:56,650 --> 00:13:58,330
does anyone ever even do this yeah

410
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:58,540
so

411
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:00,250
i was so i asked her i

412
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:01,720
was like how does someone do this

413
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,740
and she gave me the whole step

414
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:04,538
by step which i've been passed on

415
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,330
my friend will really enjoy this

416
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:13,420
glass it's getting harder right yeah

417
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:16,270
it seems i will say it seems

418
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:17,710
like a nightmare to me like just

419
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:20,260
someone you don't know but that's what

420
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:21,820
some people like i know what you

421
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:24,220
mean i was watching some like documentary

422
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:27,130
thing about um was the bunny ranch

423
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:28,690
where it's like all the like and

424
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:30,190
then these this there was like one

425
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:32,290
story of this they following this one

426
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:32,950
guy who

427
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:36,130
was very socially awkward and like just

428
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:39,310
didn't have any thing in his life

429
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:42,250
like that could sunni intimacy yeah right

430
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:44,080
and so he had this relationship with

431
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,820
this woman at the bunny ranch and

432
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:46,840
then he would see her like once

433
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,250
you're satisfied all his money because it's

434
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:49,810
really expensive and then they would spend

435
00:14:49,810 --> 00:14:51,610
the whole weekend just like fucking i

436
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:53,410
guess and then like doing activities and

437
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:54,220
stuff and just hanging

438
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:55,120
out and he just wanted to hang

439
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,740
out with like outside of the ranch

440
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:58,660
um probably just in the room i'm

441
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:01,090
guessing but then like it was he

442
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:02,500
talked on camera news because it's the

443
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,150
best time of my year and like

444
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,010
it was just yeah no i don't

445
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,390
i go back and forth like i

446
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:08,560
don't know whether it should be illegal

447
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:08,890
or not

448
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:12,820
i think people are if the woman

449
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:15,820
wants to do it then it's fine

450
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,400
isn't it weird that you that the

451
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:21,340
they the women are mainly arrested for

452
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:24,730
it and yeah but sometimes there i

453
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:25,690
mean there are a lot of people

454
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:28,300
doing it against their will yeah exactly

455
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:29,875
yeah where it becomes complicated because you

456
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:30,220
don't know

457
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,510
no if it were legal there would

458
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:33,610
probably be less of that yeah yeah

459
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:35,860
you know that's well that that's the

460
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:38,380
why you legalize anything is to regulate

461
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:40,090
it i guess yeah but i also

462
00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:42,430
feel like it prostitution is not as

463
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:45,970
a thing that i don't think that

464
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:48,490
i would ever use but makes perfect

465
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:49,870
sense to me you know yeah it's

466
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:50,080
like

467
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:52,030
it sounds good to me

468
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:57,190
prostitution it sounds good to me

469
00:15:58,390 --> 00:15:59,350
it's the new campaign

470
00:16:01,303 --> 00:16:03,400
just like regular people there's a catholic

471
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:06,340
housewives prostitution it sounds good to me

472
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:09,700
do you think the commercials would get

473
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,620
better for it

474
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:14,050
did you see boats like this call

475
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:17,080
leo's calls which is like so come

476
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,310
on we can make better commercials

477
00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:21,610
there are so many bad commercials still

478
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:23,980
being made for like just local companies

479
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:26,284
were like how did everyone say yes

480
00:16:26,295 --> 00:16:28,300
was good or that person should be

481
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:29,620
the one on camera do you want

482
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:33,070
to find kind of i this it

483
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:36,820
makes me weirdly happy is how the

484
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,820
end of like infomercials is

485
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:42,910
is still the same it has remained

486
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:45,460
unchanged like that blue screen yeah with

487
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:47,622
that without the white and yellow yeah

488
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:49,690
oh and a little box yeah it's

489
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,520
it's remain the same forever and there's

490
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:54,280
something really comforting to me yeah yeah

491
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:56,020
you think like it would have evolved

492
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:57,910
where people would just start using comic

493
00:16:57,910 --> 00:16:59,980
sans yes something but somebody's like no

494
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,230
this works this works it's it's suitably

495
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:04,210
yeah well i bet i bet what

496
00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:06,520
happened is and this happens in sketch

497
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,080
comedy a lot you put up something

498
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:09,760
that's slightly different and you're like no

499
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,380
it has to be the normal thing

500
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:13,300
yeah otherwise people aren't going to get

501
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,190
it yeah yeah yeah i mean like

502
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:17,710
people people need to recognize it so

503
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:19,330
quickly that you need to do this

504
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:19,990
it's gotta be

505
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:23,050
oil blue screen yeah the the numbers

506
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:25,240
and yellow yeah all the other types

507
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,500
in white and then there's like yeah

508
00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:28,900
i'm sort of hazy glowing box around

509
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,070
the item that were showing i bet

510
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:31,660
the editors have like tried other things

511
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:32,800
like this looks better right and you

512
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,150
go no you don't recognize it as

513
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:35,710
a thing you should call you're scared

514
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:37,840

good at it no i didn't i

549
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,330

watch them i guess um i could

554
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:58,420
be wrong but i don't think so

555
00:18:58,450 --> 00:18:59,560
but um i just thought that was

there for years asia it'll be give

778
00:26:44,055 --> 00:26:45,645
reasons to be afraid for not for

779
00:26:45,645 --> 00:26:47,505
not paying a ticket right basically

780
00:26:47,655 --> 00:26:49,695
it's really extreme and it turns into

781
00:26:49,695 --> 00:26:50,805
like you don't pay it for so

782
00:26:50,805 --> 00:26:53,085
long it turns into i mean why

783
00:26:53,085 --> 00:26:54,465
have us pay it well i have

784
00:26:54,465 --> 00:26:55,935
all the look you couldn't gamble at

785
00:26:55,935 --> 00:26:58,095
vegas no no no this is this

786
00:26:58,095 --> 00:27:00,405
is after all that i have these

787
00:27:00,405 --> 00:27:03,405
theories about like you know how jew

788
00:27:03,406 --> 00:27:06,255
accesses you know you don't support the

789
00:27:06,255 --> 00:27:07,815
man giving no acs

790
00:27:07,815 --> 00:27:09,945
excessive tickets and stuff are all designed

791
00:27:09,945 --> 00:27:12,735
to keep poor people poor right sure

792
00:27:12,735 --> 00:27:15,405
and it just compounds as as you

793
00:27:15,405 --> 00:27:16,815
don't have enough money to pay them

794
00:27:16,815 --> 00:27:18,975
it just compounds and they they they

795
00:27:19,005 --> 00:27:20,625
can just basically like just keep you

796
00:27:20,625 --> 00:27:22,425
down anyway so i had these i

797
00:27:22,425 --> 00:27:24,285
have these tickets for a long time

798
00:27:24,285 --> 00:27:26,355
that were just hanging over my head

799
00:27:26,355 --> 00:27:27,975
for years and

800
00:27:28,005 --> 00:27:30,015
they would go away at seven year

801
00:27:30,015 --> 00:27:31,845
at the seven year mark they they

802
00:27:32,085 --> 00:27:33,795
wow they go away but i would

803
00:27:33,795 --> 00:27:37,065
just be ups just really nervous about

804
00:27:37,065 --> 00:27:38,895
being pulled over for years at a

805
00:27:38,895 --> 00:27:40,455
time yeah because if they pull you

806
00:27:40,455 --> 00:27:42,225
over and it pops up your you

807
00:27:42,225 --> 00:27:44,496
go to jail right now and say

808
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:47,385
and so for for five years stretches

809
00:27:47,865 --> 00:27:48,135
some

810
00:27:48,135 --> 00:27:49,365
times i would have these things hanging

811
00:27:49,365 --> 00:27:50,925
over my head and then something would

812
00:27:50,925 --> 00:27:53,235
happen where i would would get a

813
00:27:53,235 --> 00:27:54,375
ticket for something else and they go

814
00:27:54,375 --> 00:27:55,365
you have a warren you need to

815
00:27:55,365 --> 00:27:56,415
pay this and then i would have

816
00:27:56,415 --> 00:27:58,335
the money or whatever so anyway so

817
00:27:58,635 --> 00:28:00,945
going to other countries or whatever i

818
00:28:00,945 --> 00:28:02,595

1133
00:38:56,785 --> 00:38:58,795

i had and i ah i thought

1143
00:39:14,065 --> 00:39:14,575
it was just a

1144
00:39:14,755 --> 00:39:16,195
go by thing in the in a

1145
00:39:16,195 --> 00:39:17,995
clerk would do something you know like

1146
00:39:17,995 --> 00:39:19,135
stamp it or you pay it or

1147
00:39:19,135 --> 00:39:21,175
whatever and they're like okay just go

1148
00:39:21,175 --> 00:39:22,405
sit there in the courthouse and then

1149
00:39:22,405 --> 00:39:23,365
the judge is gonna call you up

1150
00:39:23,365 --> 00:39:25,615
i was like wait i'm literally going

1151
00:39:25,615 --> 00:39:27,715
before a judge right now on tv

1152
00:39:28,135 --> 00:39:32,065
my tv randy very scary um yeah

1153
00:39:32,065 --> 00:39:33,595
and so and and then the and

1154
00:39:33,595 --> 00:39:34,735
then they were

1155
00:39:35,815 --> 00:39:37,195
they had so many people they were

1156
00:39:37,195 --> 00:39:39,505
trying to say like looked speeded along

1157
00:39:39,535 --> 00:39:40,945
you're gonna make the judge mad if

1158
00:39:40,945 --> 00:39:44,179
you don't just say guilty yeah just

1159
00:39:44,185 --> 00:39:46,045
take just say guilty to anything yeah

1160
00:39:46,075 --> 00:39:47,845
they're like telling everyone just say guilty

1161
00:39:47,875 --> 00:39:49,675
otherwise you're gonna make the judge mad

1162
00:39:49,675 --> 00:39:50,845
because we have way too many people

1163
00:39:50,845 --> 00:39:53,425
so just say guilty and so every

1164
00:39:53,425 --> 00:39:54,985
single person pretty much would get up

1165
00:39:55,015 --> 00:39:56,365
there and just say guilty and then

1166
00:39:56,365 --> 00:39:57,925
the judge would cut you a break

1167
00:39:57,925 --> 00:39:59,125
if you say we're all the same

1168
00:39:59,125 --> 00:40:01,105
kind of and prophecy right yeah yes

1169
00:40:01,465 --> 00:40:03,235
so so they would cut you a

1170
00:40:03,355 --> 00:40:05,875
ne would save you several hundred dollars

1171
00:40:05,905 --> 00:40:07,195
i remember i think the i said

1172
00:40:07,195 --> 00:40:09,355
guilty and it was like a so

1173
00:40:09,415 --> 00:40:10,975
i think that warrants at the time

1174
00:40:10,975 --> 00:40:12,385
were like seven hundred and fifty dollars

1175
00:40:12,385 --> 00:40:13,555
or something like that and they they

1176
00:40:13,585 --> 00:40:15,145
got it down to one hundred norway

1177
00:40:15,145 --> 00:40:17,485
never and i was afraid one hundred

1178
00:40:17,605 --> 00:40:18,685
two hundred

1179
00:40:19,706 --> 00:40:21,445
was afraid they were gonna make me

1180
00:40:21,445 --> 00:40:23,095
pace seven hundred bucks yeah i didn't

1181
00:40:23,095 --> 00:40:24,805
have or whatever but no but but

1182
00:40:24,805 --> 00:40:27,145
i was just shaking there and then

1183
00:40:27,145 --> 00:40:28,825
one person didn't say guilty or not

1184
00:40:28,825 --> 00:40:29,875
guilty and the judge was like

1185
00:40:31,625 --> 00:40:34,085
you are usually sure you do this

1186
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:36,605
because like yes i'm not guilty so

1187
00:40:36,605 --> 00:40:38,405
i want to say not guilty and

1188
00:40:38,405 --> 00:40:39,275
they had to set up a court

1189
00:40:39,275 --> 00:40:40,295
date and all this kind of stuff

1190
00:40:40,895 --> 00:40:42,455
but it just reminded me of just

1191
00:40:42,455 --> 00:40:43,925
how much the system is designed to

1192
00:40:43,925 --> 00:40:46,112
make you just like well i had

1193
00:40:46,112 --> 00:40:48,065
there last time i never knew how

1194
00:40:48,065 --> 00:40:51,095
much the monetary value of my infraction

1195
00:40:51,095 --> 00:40:51,785
and i never made

1196
00:40:51,785 --> 00:40:53,165
add it to the courthouse so they

1197
00:40:53,165 --> 00:40:54,695
issued a bench warrant for my arrest

1198
00:40:55,175 --> 00:40:56,975
and i i sweated that for a

1199
00:40:56,975 --> 00:40:58,835
little while and it's so weird because

1200
00:40:58,985 --> 00:41:00,845
on the one hand i'm terrified of

1201
00:41:00,845 --> 00:41:01,775
all this stuff but i think the

1202
00:41:01,775 --> 00:41:04,535
thing i was terrified to actually go

1203
00:41:04,535 --> 00:41:06,755
in the first place which led to

1204
00:41:06,755 --> 00:41:08,825
just compile yeah we're oh i know

1205
00:41:08,855 --> 00:41:10,475
now you're really in trouble we don't

1206
00:41:10,535 --> 00:41:11,608
know what's gonna happen

1207
00:41:12,065 --> 00:41:15,869
yeah causes almost paralysis fairly unknown note

1208
00:41:15,869 --> 00:41:17,225
that that had when i was younger

1209
00:41:17,225 --> 00:41:18,125
that was a big it was a

1210
00:41:18,125 --> 00:41:19,595
big thing for me it's always been

1211
00:41:19,595 --> 00:41:20,825
my whole life of just if you

1212
00:41:20,825 --> 00:41:22,925
don't know what a situation is like

1213
00:41:22,925 --> 00:41:24,845
it's tough to go into it yeah

1214
00:41:24,905 --> 00:41:26,465
whereas now i think you could read

1215
00:41:26,465 --> 00:41:29,135
enough online about certain situations like this

1216
00:41:29,135 --> 00:41:30,275
that you would go okay i think

1217
00:41:30,275 --> 00:41:31,235
i know what's gonna happen when i

1218
00:41:31,235 --> 00:41:32,105
get it but even like eve

1219
00:41:32,105 --> 00:41:33,425
and like driving to a place that

1220
00:41:33,425 --> 00:41:35,015
i don't yeah oh for oh yeah

1221
00:41:35,015 --> 00:41:36,335
and or something like that hey the

1222
00:41:36,342 --> 00:41:37,595
first time i go to a place

1223
00:41:37,595 --> 00:41:39,635
and i don't know the the route

1224
00:41:39,755 --> 00:41:42,335
yeah i'm like i have so much

1225
00:41:42,335 --> 00:41:44,105
anxiety about getting there in time not

1226
00:41:44,105 --> 00:41:45,365
getting lost whatever and then the second

1227
00:41:45,365 --> 00:41:46,625
time it's like oh this was a

1228
00:41:46,625 --> 00:41:48,725
five-minute drive you know yeah it is

1229
00:41:48,755 --> 00:41:49,985
but the first time it seems like

1230
00:41:49,985 --> 00:41:51,905
an epic journey those people who can

1231
00:41:51,905 --> 00:41:52,265
just

1232
00:41:52,265 --> 00:41:54,515
just go do something or talk to

1233
00:41:54,515 --> 00:41:56,285
someone they don't know or you know

1234
00:41:56,285 --> 00:41:58,025
anything like that or just confounding to

1235
00:41:58,025 --> 00:41:59,165

same way and what is it about

1239
00:42:03,305 --> 00:42:05,735
and i don't remember ever being brought

1240
00:42:05,735 --> 00:42:07,025
up that way of like these don't

1241
00:42:07,055 --> 00:42:08,315
talk to someone you don't know or

1242
00:42:08,555 --> 00:42:10,475

and see them up at the bar

1252
00:42:31,145 --> 00:42:32,675
talking to someone and you would think

1253
00:42:32,705 --> 00:42:33,965
oh they ran into an old friend

1254
00:42:33,965 --> 00:42:35,375
of theirs oh and it's a person

1255
00:42:35,375 --> 00:42:36,845
like it's a person they've never met

1256
00:42:36,845 --> 00:42:40,295
before i hate that like i it's

1257
00:42:40,295 --> 00:42:41,494
great i don't know i love it

1258
00:42:41,494 --> 00:42:41,765
another

1259
00:42:41,945 --> 00:42:42,515
girl

1260
00:42:43,871 --> 00:42:45,665
little i love it in other people

1261
00:42:45,845 --> 00:42:47,975
i admire the trait but i when

1262
00:42:47,975 --> 00:42:50,525
someone approaches me in a familiar way

1263
00:42:50,555 --> 00:42:52,955
yeah it depending on my mood it

1264
00:42:52,955 --> 00:42:54,485
really bothers right if i'm in the

1265
00:42:54,485 --> 00:42:56,015
mood i can like has anyone ever

1266
00:42:56,165 --> 00:42:57,605
approached you in a friendly way and

1267
00:42:57,605 --> 00:42:58,895
acted like a friend when they're really

1268
00:42:58,895 --> 00:43:00,185
just like someone who knows like a

1269
00:43:00,185 --> 00:43:02,195
fan or whatever that's what um women

1270
00:43:02,225 --> 00:43:03,665
like hey lauren hey

1271
00:43:03,785 --> 00:43:05,165
and then oh yeah your life they

1272
00:43:05,165 --> 00:43:07,517
say name yeah yeah we know ty

1273
00:43:07,595 --> 00:43:09,395
how's it going hey that bothers me

1274
00:43:09,395 --> 00:43:10,835
because it's just so familiar it's just

1275
00:43:10,835 --> 00:43:12,125
not fair because it sets up the

1276
00:43:12,425 --> 00:43:14,075
interaction you don't know what you're getting

1277
00:43:14,075 --> 00:43:16,085
yourself into yeah exactly um but i

1278
00:43:16,085 --> 00:43:18,605
think every single conversation anyone ever has

1279
00:43:18,695 --> 00:43:20,945
they should state their full name and

1280
00:43:20,945 --> 00:43:23,315
their staff their business yes i was

1281
00:43:23,345 --> 00:43:23,945
traveling with my

1282
00:43:23,945 --> 00:43:25,295
a dog over the holidays and that

1283
00:43:25,295 --> 00:43:26,675
was an invitation for a lot of

1284
00:43:26,675 --> 00:43:28,295
people to talk to me that i

1285
00:43:28,295 --> 00:43:30,815
did not sign up dogs are but

weird and then he was like he

1386
00:46:26,525 --> 00:46:28,265

1387
00:46:28,295 --> 00:46:30,005
kind of like then like popping closer

1388
00:46:30,125 --> 00:46:32,015
circling kind of just like like i

1389
00:46:32,015 --> 00:46:33,365
suppose you're looking at other things and

1390
00:46:33,365 --> 00:46:34,509
then kind of talk to me again

1391
00:46:34,509 --> 00:46:35,582
and then kind of looking away and

kinda like and then he he goes

1393
00:46:37,235 --> 00:46:38,315
and i was kind of getting more

1394
00:46:38,315 --> 00:46:39,535
and more shut down because i'm just

1395
00:46:39,535 --> 00:46:40,985
saying i don't care about this
