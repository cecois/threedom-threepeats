281
00:10:19,205 --> 00:10:19,505
into

282
00:10:21,035 --> 00:10:24,425
i'm sure i didn't i never really

283
00:10:24,425 --> 00:10:25,565
put it together

284
00:10:26,825 --> 00:10:29,135
skov using there's a whole sketch about

285
00:10:29,135 --> 00:10:31,745
it on begging oh really yeah where

286
00:10:31,775 --> 00:10:34,595
where the semester plays the saga yeah

287
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:36,545
i remember the america's funniest home videos

288
00:10:36,545 --> 00:10:38,615
well it started out as like we

289
00:10:38,645 --> 00:10:42,005
as as reggie had been had a

290
00:10:42,005 --> 00:10:43,895
hidden camera on him for his entire

291
00:10:43,895 --> 00:10:46,775
life and then every every video

292
00:10:46,775 --> 00:10:49,055
oh descended into him being hit in

293
00:10:49,055 --> 00:10:50,615
the balls with something in sky music

294
00:10:50,615 --> 00:10:52,415
started playing and then it's segwit just

295
00:10:52,445 --> 00:10:53,705
much like a bang bang sketch or

296
00:10:53,705 --> 00:10:55,595
it starts as one thing becomes another

297
00:10:55,595 --> 00:10:56,945
thing and then becomes a totally different

298
00:10:56,945 --> 00:10:58,715
things segue into a skov video where

299
00:10:59,105 --> 00:11:01,475
you hit yourself in the balls oh

300
00:11:01,475 --> 00:11:04,385
lauren and roy hill's i'm not cared

301
00:11:04,385 --> 00:11:06,935
so yeah

302
00:11:07,355 --> 00:11:10,175
finally arma it's like my whole body

303
00:11:10,175 --> 00:11:10,865
is hot

304
00:11:12,365 --> 00:11:14,105
what effect jails what a they can

305
00:11:14,151 --> 00:11:15,155

00:11:18,035 --> 00:11:19,445
oh what do you think he died

308
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:20,878
from being kicked in the balls thinking

309
00:11:20,878 --> 00:11:21,815
he might have what if that was

310
00:11:22,055 --> 00:11:23,231
the part of the story that learns

311
00:11:23,345 --> 00:11:25,055
to tell us and like she kicked

312
00:11:25,475 --> 00:11:27,185
him so hard in the balls his

313
00:11:27,185 --> 00:11:29,135

00:11:29,135 --> 00:11:31,775
the ground and yeah blood he died

315
00:11:31,775 --> 00:11:32,135

321
00:11:44,105 --> 00:11:47,315
speaking of watches i did not know

322
00:11:47,315 --> 00:11:49,145
how to tell time until i was

323
00:11:49,145 --> 00:11:51,155
in seventh grade what and i was

324
00:11:51,155 --> 00:11:53,765
given a watch for christmas that's unusual

325
00:11:53,765 --> 00:11:56,448
for stressing out in class because ah

326
00:11:56,465 --> 00:11:58,598
da and then did you test we

327
00:11:58,598 --> 00:11:59,735
you to see like what o'clock said

328
00:11:59,735 --> 00:12:00,095
on it

329
00:12:01,175 --> 00:12:02,765
i don't think so because i don't

330
00:12:02,765 --> 00:12:04,505
remember that ever happening but i remember

331
00:12:04,655 --> 00:12:06,515
i've i've told this one spontaneous nation

332
00:12:06,515 --> 00:12:08,315
because andy daly had the same thing

333
00:12:08,345 --> 00:12:09,965
really that he was it took him

334
00:12:09,965 --> 00:12:11,435
forever to learn how to tell time

335
00:12:11,495 --> 00:12:13,865
i remember finding it really overwhelming when

336
00:12:13,865 --> 00:12:15,485
you think about it you don't need

337
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:18,035
to anymore like the clock face it's

338
00:12:18,335 --> 00:12:19,895
out of date at this point there's

339
00:12:19,895 --> 00:12:21,305
no reason but everywhere else

340
00:12:21,335 --> 00:12:23,825
as them no but it still i

341
00:12:23,825 --> 00:12:25,655

343
00:12:27,395 --> 00:12:29,975
thing that that it's necessary for is

344
00:12:29,975 --> 00:12:32,495
for when someone's at your three you

345
00:12:32,495 --> 00:12:33,635

626
00:22:48,985 --> 00:22:51,745
very abrupt fade out and then he's

627
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:54,535
just talking about a completely different topic

628
00:22:54,835 --> 00:22:57,145

yeah ok you'll do it genius you

1184
00:44:01,385 --> 00:44:03,665

1185
00:44:03,695 --> 00:44:05,945
you can only go what if you

1186
00:44:05,945 --> 00:44:08,225
go high when the starting line but

1187
00:44:08,225 --> 00:44:10,475
yeah anyway that's exactly what i was

1188
00:44:10,475 --> 00:44:12,095
gonna say start the first point lost

1189
00:44:12,125 --> 00:44:14,345
or just hiding around firsthand and then

1190
00:44:14,345 --> 00:44:15,695
you just work the other way back

1191
00:44:15,755 --> 00:44:15,965
yeah

1192
00:44:16,055 --> 00:44:18,095
instead of starting neutral do you immune

1193
00:44:18,095 --> 00:44:20,465
me do it me yeah ok i'll

1194
00:44:20,465 --> 00:44:21,785
go the jody want to start all

1195
00:44:21,815 --> 00:44:23,585
i'm gonna start as high as i

1196
00:44:23,585 --> 00:44:24,575
can i'll start as low as i

1197
00:44:24,575 --> 00:44:24,845
can

1198
00:44:26,015 --> 00:44:28,205
okay and you're gonna be the judge

1199
00:44:28,235 --> 00:44:29,855
but you're so you're going hire yeah

1200
00:44:29,915 --> 00:44:31,655
and you're going lower alright

1201
00:44:34,055 --> 00:44:35,075
well i can understand you

1202
00:44:38,885 --> 00:44:41,195
that's one of the few states that

1203
00:44:41,195 --> 00:44:43,475
i know of no to cheating cheating

1204
00:44:43,925 --> 00:44:46,235
cheating is cheating just covering the thing

1205
00:44:46,235 --> 00:44:47,825
i was i was just like oh

1206
00:44:47,945 --> 00:44:49,205
maybe you should try it some time

1207
00:44:49,205 --> 00:44:50,375
it seems really neat

1208
00:44:51,965 --> 00:44:54,425
i have always wondered if it would

1209
00:44:54,425 --> 00:44:55,805
be a fun place

1210
00:44:56,915 --> 00:44:58,685
to take a cruise to i'm sure

1211
00:44:58,685 --> 00:44:59,795
it would be it would be very

1212
00:44:59,795 --> 00:45:01,475
cool to take a cruise there and

1213
00:45:01,475 --> 00:45:04,055

1220
00:45:15,245 --> 00:45:16,685
best sex of my day

1221
00:45:18,335 --> 00:45:20,915

1222
00:45:22,025 --> 00:45:24,695

1223
00:45:24,695 --> 00:45:27,395
on friday ha how funny thursday of

1224
00:45:27,395 --> 00:45:29,945
two thousand and two oh okay mine

1225
00:45:29,945 --> 00:45:32,135
was friday of two thousand and twelve

1226
00:45:33,725 --> 00:45:35,075
why did we both talk like it

1227
00:45:35,075 --> 00:45:37,505
was currently well i don't know why

1228
00:45:37,565 --> 00:45:39,155
we would do something like this or

1229
00:45:39,155 --> 00:45:40,025
who's plateaued

1230
00:45:41,825 --> 00:45:45,515
the problem is everything what is the

1231
00:45:45,515 --> 00:45:48,275
problem you can owe me you can

1232
00:45:48,305 --> 00:45:50,225
only make your voice so i mean

1233
00:45:50,225 --> 00:45:51,515
you only make it worse so higher

1234
00:45:51,515 --> 00:45:53,675
so low right but it's easier to

1235
00:45:53,675 --> 00:45:56,585
be indistinguishable if you get really high

1236
00:45:56,975 --> 00:45:58,625
yeah get really low because if you

1237
00:45:58,655 --> 00:46:00,125
run you get you you hit a

1238
00:46:00,125 --> 00:46:01,385
bottom where you can't make

1239
00:46:01,445 --> 00:46:02,705
yeah but i feel like i feel

1240
00:46:02,705 --> 00:46:04,625
like lauren went all the way down

1241
00:46:04,655 --> 00:46:07,085
way quicker than i'd want to raise

1242
00:46:07,085 --> 00:46:09,245
lowers so i guess it's not it's

1243
00:46:09,275 --> 00:46:11,615
not it's not know if if your

1244
00:46:11,615 --> 00:46:14,675
voices in this is indistinct indecipherable it's

1245
00:46:14,675 --> 00:46:16,295
just if when do you when do

1246
00:46:16,295 --> 00:46:17,555
you yeah when do you max out

1247
00:46:17,675 --> 00:46:21,005
so who has really fun no it's

1248
00:46:21,005 --> 00:46:21,515
not this

1249
00:46:21,669 --> 00:46:22,985
you saw any of this been fun

1250
00:46:23,855 --> 00:46:24,785

dad

1257
00:46:41,735 --> 00:46:43,295
the one point is that when she's

1258
00:46:43,445 --> 00:46:44,975
talking to when she's in jail and

1259
00:46:44,975 --> 00:46:48,125

i never heard that i might be

1261
00:46:49,763 --> 00:46:51,845
weird but i must say she's crazy

1262
00:46:52,475 --> 00:46:53,975
and you think she's crazy so you

1264
00:46:56,315 --> 00:46:58,835
do think she was a genius by

1265
00:46:58,835 --> 00:47:00,035
the way i thought she would be

1266
00:47:00,046 --> 00:47:01,865
whose gene name sounds so

1267
00:47:01,895 --> 00:47:03,665

1271
00:47:09,215 --> 00:47:10,595
this man walked into a bank with

1272
00:47:10,595 --> 00:47:12,695
a bomb strapped around his neck and

1273
00:47:12,695 --> 00:47:14,555
he died his head blew up when

00:47:16,355 --> 00:47:18,515
this woman to be the cause and

1276
00:47:18,515 --> 00:47:20,525

yeah i mean she's evil but i

1282
00:47:30,425 --> 00:47:32,345
