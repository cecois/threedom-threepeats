82
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:03,270
like not remembering ah didn't say the

83
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:05,220
last person who was alive and in

84
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:07,080
wizard of oz just died is that

85
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:10,140
true oh so your entire film they

86
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:13,260
were people in wax and like yeah

87
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,970
things yeah yeah because in my mind

88
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:15,630
i kind of thought it was a

89
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:17,040
rolling masks and hidden things

90
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:20,010

00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:21,720

wizard of oz they would do that

99
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,890
with certain movies like the day of

00:05:26,786 --> 00:05:28,410
they all hated each other to like

154
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:30,090
you know how like please them since

155
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:32,580
friends for the friends were the only

156
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:34,380
friends who actually made friends yeah the

157
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:36,870
show creators you know but like in

158
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,970
the history of television well i think

159
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:41,370
so only know usually there's like one

160
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:42,880
person that everyone in the cast dislikes

161
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,160
likes isn't it there i think

162
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:45,600
it's often the case that's the most

163
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,160
looking like a will and grace they

164
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,630
all love they'll probably love it yeah

165
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:50,070
have a great time look at bajillion

166
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:51,990
dollar product but then they make these

167
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:53,580
when he pulled the dance around

168
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:56,189
they may know his answer i don't

169
00:05:56,194 --> 00:05:58,530
like like high early yeah early on

170
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:00,060
and they probably all hate each other

171
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,440
but they're all goofing around and laughing

172
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,490
know like they don't hate each other

173
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:05,846
yet they probably all actually do don't

174
00:06:05,846 --> 00:06:07,980
think hey no other way like episode

175
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:09,750
ten and then they're like watching this

176
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,760
opening my dad if any of you

177
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,950
were on veronica's closet please let us

178
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:14,850
know if you all hate it

179
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,380
each other i would like to know

180
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,970
yeah there's this thing i want to

181
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:22,920
talk about this because in the credits

182
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:26,010
i guess the comedic character danced around

183
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:28,350
and then fell and it was supposed

184
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:29,730
to be funny like she tripped and

185
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:31,230
fell okay so here's something that i've

186
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:33,690
been noticing and i was watching ah

187
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:36,780
what's that cbs show love island and

188
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:37,650

224
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:51,720

the one watching nurse yeah i'm the

229
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:01,260
one watching love island instead of a

230
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:02,850
real comedy so i guess

231
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,920
it is you know i've i i

232
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,300
love sorry is it supposed to be

233
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:07,890
a comedy no no no but they

234
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,150
but they they they tried to be

235
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:11,760
funny no they well the the narrow

236
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:13,440
okay so here's like comedy here's what

237
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,660
i could glean from it because it's

238
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:18,510
very popular infused humor it's very poor

239
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:21,900
oversee use it's very popular overseas but

240
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,070
there's a scottish area

241
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,198
island yeah there's like you're watching the

242
00:08:25,198 --> 00:08:26,550
u k version no no i'm watching

243
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:27,510
the u s but from what i

244
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:29,040
could understand from what i read is

245
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,390
there in the u k version there's

246
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:32,790
a scottish guy he sounds older sounds

247
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:34,710
like ferguson he's like oh why did

248
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:37,050
you do the dough boy who everyone

249
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:38,970
thinks is very very funny oh look

250
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:41,190
out don't fall down yeah yeah yeah

251
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:43,440
stewie attractive so that guy

252
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,300
oh right you haven't seen it no

253
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:47,250
it actually is really accurate so in

254
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:49,410
this version that american's funny his video

255
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:50,880
yeah he just makes tough shit over

256
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,770
it it is yeah so in this

257
00:08:52,770 --> 00:08:55,080
version they they cast a new person

258
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:55,710
and it's a comedy

259
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:58,950
who is doing the voice now two

260
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:01,110
two seven is a comedy yeah i

261
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:02,490
know two two seven is a comedy

262
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:03,960
so i think they cast someone who's

263
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,660
not a comedian but he's household and

264
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:09,810
any sounds like he's reading written stuff

265
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,390
you know in a way so ah

266
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:14,490
but but they they've gone for sort

267
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:16,080
of more of ah like a guy

268
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:17,040
dishing on stuff

269
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,240
the kind of thing like this is

270
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,370
like here's someone here's the other thing

271
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:22,410
that i don't like about anytime anyone

272
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:24,030
on the show gets a text he

273
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:26,280
goes sand which i think is gabe

274
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:28,500
ah lehman's thing oh do you feel

275
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,930
like sure there's they're ripping them off

276
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,820
yeah that actually it's been somebody receives

277
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,260
a text or someone sends it someone

278
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:36,030
on the show receives a tax they

279
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:36,948
have to make a big deal of

280
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:37,020
it

281
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:38,310
out of it and go off i

282
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:40,650
gotta tell everybody they might do that

283
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:42,270
in the old one because it the

284
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:44,400
premise is like that the narrator is

285
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,890
sending them that yes but he's he's

286
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:48,930
saying it he'll retail read it a

287
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:49,950
lot and then say so no no

288
00:09:49,951 --> 00:09:52,020
no no the narrator says speaking of

289
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:54,210
which i have something for these people

290
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:56,880
sand i have to look at the

291
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:57,330
epo

292
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:58,530
you want to see okay see if

293
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:00,210
he says said yeah because i feel

294
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:01,980
like people are boom i think people

295
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:04,470
are ripping off games i would think

296
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:07,050
that a lot these days yeah it's

297
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:08,880

weirdest voice right now yeah i'm trying

422
00:14:34,805 --> 00:14:36,887
to think of anyone any entertainer who

one

426
00:14:43,445 --> 00:14:45,725
but even he holly sure um but

427
00:14:45,725 --> 00:14:47,555
that was more of an affected manner

428
00:14:47,555 --> 00:14:50,465
of speech well you can't tell me

429
00:14:50,465 --> 00:14:51,785
that kevin has pulled up the most

distinctive voices in hollywood know do like

431
00:14:53,585 --> 00:14:59,495

up

436
00:15:06,185 --> 00:15:08,495
oh shit i'm trying to think i

437
00:15:08,495 --> 00:15:10,262
sort of thought of someone recently where

438
00:15:10,262 --> 00:15:11,525
i was i think putting that on

439
00:15:11,945 --> 00:15:13,325
that had to have been gold when

440
00:15:13,325 --> 00:15:15,305
you discovered like wait a minute i

441
00:15:15,305 --> 00:15:16,655

442
00:15:16,655 --> 00:15:19,205
else has ever done oh yeah you

443
00:15:19,205 --> 00:15:20,495
know man i wish i could do

444
00:15:20,495 --> 00:15:22,895
one the gilbert god freed and he's

445
00:15:23,075 --> 00:15:25,085
yeah he's someone's putting on no because

446
00:15:25,085 --> 00:15:26,165
then we yeah we saw

447
00:15:26,285 --> 00:15:27,575
or even that bunch of them or

448
00:15:27,575 --> 00:15:29,165
whatever is putting on a thing when

449
00:15:29,165 --> 00:15:30,845
you don't know about their murder or

450
00:15:30,905 --> 00:15:32,975
you think he always talk like me

451
00:15:32,975 --> 00:15:33,845
i think so

452
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:36,215
i doubt over godfrey and like that

453
00:15:36,365 --> 00:15:39,005
there's like some documentary he's in and

454
00:15:39,005 --> 00:15:40,565
he uses his normal or no yeah

455
00:15:40,595 --> 00:15:42,005

456
00:15:42,005 --> 00:15:44,045
looked up online but there's a documentary

three ham teens well you know what

494
00:17:08,555 --> 00:17:10,317
i realised what type of value my

495
00:17:10,445 --> 00:17:12,065
mentioned is like saved by the bell

496
00:17:12,065 --> 00:17:13,655
is written but was written by like

497
00:17:13,745 --> 00:17:16,025
older white guys who like in the

498
00:17:16,025 --> 00:17:18,245
nineties they were like mariska stouts for

499
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:19,175
the fifties

500
00:17:19,385 --> 00:17:20,855
and they were like yeah they mess

501
00:17:20,855 --> 00:17:22,115
with the unsay by the bell they

502
00:17:22,115 --> 00:17:24,155
always seem like fifty songs and like

503
00:17:24,155 --> 00:17:25,685
casey case so maybe it's like they

504
00:17:25,797 --> 00:17:27,305
think was like they were really not

505
00:17:27,305 --> 00:17:29,285
hip with the times and like many

506
00:17:29,315 --> 00:17:30,755
things looked right well they did not

507
00:17:30,755 --> 00:17:32,345
care no but that was a weird

508
00:17:32,345 --> 00:17:33,905
give a show that was like f

509
00:17:33,905 --> 00:17:36,425

515
00:17:45,065 --> 00:17:46,895
like because the people writing it yeah

00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:49,355

559
00:19:14,795 --> 00:19:17,285

00:19:21,935 --> 00:19:23,375
make myself feel better like all the

564
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:25,655
time and like also i was walking

565
00:19:25,685 --> 00:19:29,015
up watching years watches the ah whatever

566
00:19:29,045 --> 00:19:30,815

568
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:34,835
oh try to watch that she'll

569
00:19:35,015 --> 00:19:36,751
watch that just as comfort food yeah

570
00:19:36,751 --> 00:19:38,465
yeah i totally get it yeah i

571
00:19:38,465 --> 00:19:41,075
watch food as comfort food yeah you

572
00:19:41,285 --> 00:19:42,935
watch a steak i'll make up a

573
00:19:43,055 --> 00:19:45,515
big meatloaf and they'll just look at

574
00:19:45,515 --> 00:19:47,195
it do you feel about shows about

575
00:19:47,195 --> 00:19:49,205
food like i don't really get that

576
00:19:49,205 --> 00:19:51,875
excited to know yeah i'll do probably

577
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:53,225
the only thing that i meet you

578
00:19:53,435 --> 00:19:55,085
yeah i thought that about top chef

579
00:19:55,085 --> 00:19:57,515
i was like look a singing competition

580
00:19:57,515 --> 00:19:59,329
you're hearing beautiful music la la la

581
00:19:59,337 --> 00:20:02,915
la um a dancing show you're watching

582
00:20:02,945 --> 00:20:05,495
beautiful dancing la la la la but

583
00:20:05,495 --> 00:20:07,295
a cooking show you can't taste it

584
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:08,705
so how but i guess the look

585
00:20:08,705 --> 00:20:10,265
of most people just love looking at

586
00:20:10,265 --> 00:20:13,415
food look of food is so appetizing

587
00:20:13,445 --> 00:20:14,645
and people like to feel how to

588
00:20:14,645 --> 00:20:15,155
cook like

589
00:20:15,425 --> 00:20:16,415
i think some people watch it because

590
00:20:16,415 --> 00:20:18,395
they get tips or getting inspired to

591
00:20:18,395 --> 00:20:20,165
make something or try something but yes

592
00:20:20,405 --> 00:20:22,235
i've learned how to make several amuse-bouche

593
00:20:22,295 --> 00:20:23,525
you know what i like watching it

594
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:25,115
more vita watch a cooking show is

595
00:20:25,115 --> 00:20:27,395
the top chef junior oh is that

596
00:20:27,395 --> 00:20:29,105
so no yeah maybe i'd try that

597
00:20:29,165 --> 00:20:30,155
when the kids know how to make

598
00:20:30,155 --> 00:20:32,015
something like who yeah i realized the

599
00:20:32,015 --> 00:20:33,485
problem that i have with with shows

600
00:20:33,485 --> 00:20:35,375
like that even like it i remember

601
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:38,400
oh like a season of top chef

602
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,930
i remember watching a couple seasons of

603
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:42,210
project runway the problem that i have

604
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:43,830
with those shows the the the thing

605
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:44,910
i like about it is people are

606
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,890
making a thing they like they're still

607
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:49,230
contributing to society well there's there's skilled

608
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:51,330
people who are who are making something

609
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,680
it's cool and it's going to fountain

610
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,240
him but it's the personalities of the

611
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,100
contestants it's the reality show

612
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:58,290
aspect of it which maybe they've backed

613
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:00,660
off of more but a lot of

614
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:02,550

how when i used to get massages

682
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:55,488
before i ever started working out and

683
00:23:55,488 --> 00:23:57,540
i would get bruised from the massages

684
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:58,380
and i was thinking i was gonna

685
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:00,300
groove and be like is it because

686
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:01,920

was like you were going to say

688
00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:04,080

it threw up and they had to

1021
00:35:38,390 --> 00:35:41,330
like tweak it so it was not

1022
00:35:41,330 --> 00:35:43,220

00:36:17,090 --> 00:36:18,560
like a back to the future one

1040
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,300
of those kind of yeah yes the

1041
00:36:20,330 --> 00:36:22,250
the star tours was the first one

1044
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:28,310
around being shaken young not stirred and

1045
00:36:28,310 --> 00:36:31,460
then um meanwhile but because the reason

1046
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:33,020
that james bond rides stirs you

1047
00:36:34,370 --> 00:36:36,830
which is just it's own brand you're

1048
00:36:36,830 --> 00:36:38,240
just like in a big bucket and

1049
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:42,200
then okay like big dick dobson mixes

1050
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:45,440
everybody speaking softly um do you scary

1051
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,160
that would be if you were in

1052
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:49,250
like a big gigantic water thing and

1053
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:50,180
like you with a bunch of people

1054
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:51,500
and then a big spoon comes in

1055
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:52,460
and mixes you all up and you're

1056
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:54,020
just spinning and you can't control it

1057
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:54,320
and i don't

1058
00:36:54,770 --> 00:36:57,080
oh okay so it's killing me scary

1059
00:36:57,110 --> 00:36:58,340
how many mosquitoes have you ever thought

1060
00:36:58,340 --> 00:37:00,350
about like if you were suddenly transported

1061
00:37:00,350 --> 00:37:03,320
to a different yes ah like alien

1062
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:05,090
world and you were you're as big

1063
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:07,010
as your dogs are are your cats

1064
00:37:07,010 --> 00:37:08,240
are in real life and they were

1065
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:10,400
big and they couldn't understand you and

1066
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,750
you were like hey hey hey and

1067
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:13,310
that's like barking to them with the

1068
00:37:13,310 --> 00:37:14,510
dogs and cats are there check out

1069
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:15,980
would be my god but now there

1070
00:37:16,010 --> 00:37:18,170
we've swapped sizes yes the dogs and

1071
00:37:18,170 --> 00:37:20,720
catchers because like i'm their pet yeah

1072
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:22,040
and they take care of me they

1073
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,210
take care of you because you don't

1074
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:24,290
i mean even though you know and

1075
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,300
posable thumbs here's the thing would your

1076
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:27,620
oppose kind of on them

1077
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:30,500
i wonder if you would get to

1078
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:32,000
the point where i honestly would do

1079
00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:34,010
everything that'd be fine i would struggle

1080
00:37:34,010 --> 00:37:35,630
a giant dogfish they were giving me

1081
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:37,610
food and taking to pee when i

1082
00:37:37,610 --> 00:37:39,260
looked like i had to go and

1083
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:40,190
then they would let me curl up

1084
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:41,330
in bed with them at night but

1085
00:37:41,330 --> 00:37:42,410
would you want what if you could

1086
00:37:42,410 --> 00:37:43,970
understand their language and you know that

1087
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:44,870
they're talking to you like you're a

1088
00:37:44,870 --> 00:37:45,620
fucking idiot

1089
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:47,960
i would but they don't understand yours

1090
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:50,090
so but but here's my question though

1091
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:51,710

1092
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:53,570

totally transported to a different world but

1105
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,890
do you think that you would eventually

1106
00:38:27,890 --> 00:38:30,800
grow so dependent on your masters that

1107
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,060
you would want to cuddle them like

1108
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:34,640
our dogs do yeah you do you

1109
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:37,160
just miss ko i mean god would

1110
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:38,900
you want to sit him down obi-wan

1111
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:40,040
i feel like if it was just

1112
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:41,390
a world where pets are reversed and

1113
00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:43,400
i'm the pet now that's fine but

1114
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,450
if it's a world where like i

1115
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,336
have a master idol

1116
00:38:46,430 --> 00:38:48,680
i mean that's a very different scenario

1117
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:50,210
you're pitching but you know we're like

1118
00:38:50,210 --> 00:38:51,620
you do have opposable thumbs in the

1119
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:53,180
entire time you're trying to go hey

1120
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:55,070
there's a mistake why am i have

1121
00:38:55,070 --> 00:38:57,080
a life so important ache because yeah

1122
00:38:57,110 --> 00:38:58,190
man what's your what are you what

1123
00:38:58,190 --> 00:39:00,020
are you fucking obsession with opposable think

1124
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:02,060
that's the reason that dogs and cats

1125
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:04,040
are so dependent on us is because

1126
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,060
they can't just open the door i

1127
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:06,140
know but if they were big they

1128
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:06,560
still couldn't

1129
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:07,460
do it they'd be in a world

1130
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:09,740
where opposable thumbs were meaningless i have

1131
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:11,390
six monkeys into raccoons and they can't

1132
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:12,200
do shit without me

1133
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:18,260
your house is filthy but hey because

1134
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:20,060
they will clean it was covered in

1135
00:39:20,090 --> 00:39:22,100
monkey swine i get them all they

1136
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:23,420
do is sit around typing all day

1137
00:39:23,450 --> 00:39:26,120
yeah she looks like human shit i

1138
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:26,570
hope so

1139
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:30,020
i think all shit looks vaguely to

1140
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:32,720
say ever seen a bird shit the

1141
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:36,380

paulino we were sharing the title of

1150
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,990
pause is like a doctor who one

1151
00:39:59,990 --> 00:40:01,520
of the special episodes i would let

1152
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:02,900
all the guys get together honestly

1153
00:40:02,990 --> 00:40:04,460
dead ones i would love it if

1154
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:05,840
when you die and you will die

1155
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:09,290
we'll see if one of our mutual

1156
00:40:09,290 --> 00:40:10,070
friends took over

1157
00:40:11,690 --> 00:40:13,130
yeah who is who would it be

1158
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:15,380
hodgman or does he already is entrenched

1159
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:17,840
in his mighty stuff i think he's

1160
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,730
gone too far into too far and

1161
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:21,440
there was a time there was a

1162
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:22,640
time there's gotta be someone who's more

1163
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:23,840
of a cipher that we know who

1164
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:26,510
could take upon all of the affectations

1165
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:28,940
you guys get scared when you really

1166
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:29,750
think about the fact that you have

1167
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:30,800
no idea when your grand die

1168
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:33,080

first episode someone got too drunk or

1259
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:39,670
whatever so they shut down the open

1260
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:41,350
many people did because they were serving

1261
00:43:41,350 --> 00:43:44,740
the audience whoa the show was crucial

1262
00:43:44,740 --> 00:43:46,420
was live live and they were serving

1263
00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:48,160
the audience boos and it just got

1264
00:43:48,190 --> 00:43:49,960
out of hand so fast people would

1265
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:51,760
start yelling and stuff yeah but the

1266
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:53,740
first episode they shut down hollywood boulevard

1267
00:43:53,740 --> 00:43:55,030

1268
00:43:55,030 --> 00:43:56,560
of the street and so we were

1269
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:56,890

00:43:59,409 --> 00:44:01,390
this one really that host i did

1273
00:44:01,390 --> 00:44:03,130
when i was young and i figured

1274
00:44:03,130 --> 00:44:06,580
out through having the band being television

a late night talk show i fell

1278
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:14,260
i figured out that i just wanted

1279
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:15,370
to have a comedy show not be

1282
00:44:18,370 --> 00:44:19,930
doing comedy when i was growing up

1283
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:21,460
is the late night show like letterman

1284
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:22,840
