00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,770
bag because i don't want to talk

55
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:09,570
about the specific thing but like basically

56
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:11,070
i was a part of something and

57
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:12,750
this person happened to see it and

58
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:14,280
they said it was not good and

59
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,320
i was like why would you say

60
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,240
that to me it's my blog lie

61
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,770
now i feel bad and i haven't

62
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:21,030
even seen it i don't even know

63
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:22,950
like i don't have my own opinion

64
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:25,380
is i wanna just say fuck you

65
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:26,880
but then my initial reaction was

66
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:28,260
wow now i'm afraid to see it

67
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:29,520
and then that person was like oh

68
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,230
bye so you'd never said fuck you

69
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:33,540
know i i was surprised i was

70
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:36,180
so surprised with it but you know

71
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:38,790
when i think i tend to stick

72
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:41,040
up for myself but if something surprises

73
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,390
me so much i'm like duh

74
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,790
you're finally gone i didn't um know

75
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:49,200
what to say and also you could

76
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,760
always reach out to the person now

77
00:02:50,767 --> 00:02:52,860
it just me dad is fighting you

78
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:53,670
get a chance to say this at

79
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:54,900
the time but fuck you yeah i

80
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:55,860
meant i meant to say that that

81
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:56,340
was really

82
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:59,070
i forgot about that being an aspect

83
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:00,330
of the song whip it by devo

84
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:02,219
is that it's not too late do

85
00:03:02,219 --> 00:03:04,320
with it you'll feel chapters you still

86
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,510
have a chance to win lane um

87
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:08,520
i think what happens in those moments

88
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,650
is someone is crossing a line in

89
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:13,290
such a colossal way that of course

90
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:14,550
you don't have a response yeah for

91
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:16,050
that because it's like you have to

92
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:17,520
process i wouldn't have someone

93
00:03:17,551 --> 00:03:19,890
really to me something they're in is

94
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:21,630
bad yeah i had one the other

95
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:23,010
day where i've felt bad about it

96
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:25,110
my friend was talking about a new

97
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:27,360
record that he really liked and before

98
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:29,160
he could even talk about it i

99
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,660
was like oh i hate that record

100
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:31,620
blah blah blah and gave all the

101
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:32,730
reasons why i hated it and i

102
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:35,100
was like why am i who let

103
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:36,900
him enjoy his record like why do

104
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:37,680
i why does my

105
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,510
opinion have to supersede his yeah you

106
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:40,740
know what i mean why because it's

107
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:42,630
not worth putting in there i've become

108
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:45,180
so conscious of that because i think

109
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:46,530
because of the internet you see how

110
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:48,300
often people do it because how often

111
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:50,190
people check because this was the album

112
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:52,230
because the internet goes yeah this is

113
00:03:52,233 --> 00:03:54,150
america i mean on the internet um

114
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:56,580
you see how often people offer an

115
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:57,840
unsolicited opinion about so

116
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,850
something that just doesn't need to be

117
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:02,220
there yeah and like i realize it

118
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:03,660
makes me so conscious of what i

119
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,670
do that and i've stopped myself so

120
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:08,040
many times now from chiming in like

121
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,330
why didn't care for very much like

122
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,190
yeah that's the shit yeah not the

123
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:12,840
taco and i've done that too but

124
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,070
i feel like it sometimes i do

125
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:16,890
it because i'm like i i also

126
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:18,000
saw that thing and i

127
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:19,350
didn't like it and if my friends

128
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:20,460
just got something they watched like we

129
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:21,660
have we don't know anyone and end

130
00:04:21,684 --> 00:04:23,760
or whatever yeah i'm like i wanna

131
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,230
say i didn't like it because i

132
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:26,670
want to talk about it you want

133
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:27,960
to talk about life because you're an

134
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,760
artist you wanna talk about why something

135
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,651
works or why something you like about

136
00:04:31,651 --> 00:04:33,060
it because i hated that or whatever

137
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:34,200
and then like but i feel like

138
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,670
it does shut down things because i

139
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:36,900
don't shut down things like oh i

140
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,160
guess i'm dumb because i liked it

141
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:40,110
yeah something prevention it also depends on

142
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:41,820
the relationship yeah and it depends on

143
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,110

recent show that's not good what's the

174
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:00,210
point i'm putting it out there i

feel like i try to be very

176
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,850
sparing with that the notable exception for

177
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:04,740
me in recent years was making fun

178
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,090
of the new twin peaks which i

00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:15,480
attraction of being a troll online oh

00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,430
because yeah you because it's hilarious it

185
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:18,930

00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:14,400
looking i'm in no way to take

209
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:15,720
what would it take for you to

210
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:19,710
have sex adult trump money or there's

211
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:21,540
nothing that could do it there's nothing

212
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:24,450
there's nothing out about for you for

213
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:24,810
me

214
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:28,740
i'm okay really affected you already have

215
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,200
just really putting myself known but i

216
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,060
mean really being an honest about it

217
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:35,850
putting myself in this situation it probably

218
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:37,950
would have to be in the it

219
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:39,930
would be money definitely well for sure

220
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:41,520
but like think about this if it

221
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,990
gave you like millions of dollars then

222
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:43,980
you bought a house with it or

223
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:45,360
something you'd be like this is the

224
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,080
house that that

225
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:48,270
i thought donald donald trump got me

226
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,860
but what if it were a transactional

227
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:51,900
thing that was not about money also

228
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,250
whatever it was through a glory hole

229
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:54,390
i didn't have to know it was

230
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:56,430
him until later you know you must

231
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:58,290
know you must i would have to

232
00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:00,390
know but okay show because the way

233
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:02,160
the deep blue what if it's a

234
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,010
thing where pubic hair looks just like

235
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:05,220
the hair

236
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:08,610
it's all swept over underneath his ball

237
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:10,050
and pushes into the glory hole

238
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:13,650
pushes through

239
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:18,060
just balls through just like hey those

240
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:20,040
aren't necessary for this i want you

241
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:20,550
to smoke

242
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:24,360
like one of those things where it's

243
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,770
like okay i will have sex with

244
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:28,710
donald trump and then he has to

245
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:31,560
resign as president yeah yes just like

246
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,510
yes yesterday nidhi he had been asked

247
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:35,010
to admit he was a terrible incompetent

248
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:36,990
president and everyone who who works from

249
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:38,190
sb fired and they have to get

250
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:39,930
all people who i would take out

251
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:41,280
but he can never go back on

252
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:41,370
it

253
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:42,960
because you'll never go back you can

254
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,280
say like a year later out after

255
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,480
he's out of office like i just

256
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,700
did and i guess he has to

257
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,590
stand by it forever and i get

258
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:51,671
thirty million dollars the idea yeah i

259
00:08:51,671 --> 00:08:52,710
would need lots lots of money but

260
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:54,570
the idea of that wouldn't be enough

261
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:57,210
for you thirty million dollar no not

262
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:59,010
thirty million i'm just him resigning and

263
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:00,810
and i wanted all the wrong i

264
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:01,650
wouldn't you wouldn't

265
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,940
take it for the team for free

266
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:03,900
i guess i'd probably get a lot

267
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:05,430
of money in like speaking engagement

268
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,240
speak about the comb over on his

269
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,610
balls so what's cool about his cause

270
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,470
they're so small i mean it's like

271
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,750
small balls make your dick look big

272
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:21,630
to him what else would i pictured

273
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:22,950
him putting his balls through the glory

274
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:24,180
hole i was thinking i had a

275
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:25,710
whole sentence in my head where he

276
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:27,240
says i have to push him through

277
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,340
because then you can buy perspective makes

278
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:30,420
me think

279
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:33,180
like that's like the raiders of the

280
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:35,010
lost ark boulder yeah on the other

281
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:37,410
side right and then he puts his

282
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,450
his dick through there and the years

283
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:40,596
from the other side of the wall

284
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:43,050
yeah no because he's like yeah gotta

285
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:45,660
get back gotta get them ballsy like

286
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:49,560
now huh yeah i think i think

287
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,600
i would do it here's

288
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:52,620
the thing i would do it because

289
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:54,180
i love him so just put that

290
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:55,680
out there i would just want to

291
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,110
do it but like emotionally yeah my

292
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:02,460
daughter yeah and magnetically yeah but in

293
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:03,450
terms of like trying to help the

294
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:05,160
world i'd really wanna get it's actually

295
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,600
you're so drawn to someone emotionally you

296
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,280
don't find them a trap physically attract

297
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:11,430
yeah and it's weird that this very

298
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:11,760
strong

299
00:10:12,405 --> 00:10:14,955
reaction doesn't bring along with it the

300
00:10:14,955 --> 00:10:17,385
physical attraction yeah for like trump well

301
00:10:17,385 --> 00:10:18,975
i can look like like yeah i

302
00:10:18,975 --> 00:10:19,665
can look at him and say i

303
00:10:19,665 --> 00:10:21,105
don't think he's attractive person but i

304
00:10:21,105 --> 00:10:23,895
really am drawn drawn to him just

305
00:10:23,895 --> 00:10:25,995
like humans love him and i love

306
00:10:26,025 --> 00:10:27,435
him i'm in love with him i

307
00:10:27,435 --> 00:10:28,755
love him and i'm in love with

308
00:10:29,115 --> 00:10:31,305
my boys anyway

309
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:33,675
i got busted online because it's somebody

310
00:10:33,675 --> 00:10:34,995
that i that i follow on twitter

311
00:10:34,995 --> 00:10:36,015
it was funny and this is i

312
00:10:36,015 --> 00:10:37,575
think a fun way that you can

313
00:10:37,575 --> 00:10:41,085
be negative on twitter that's not hurting

314
00:10:41,085 --> 00:10:44,235
anyone but she was saying what um

315
00:10:44,535 --> 00:10:46,875
what video game tropes do you not

316
00:10:46,875 --> 00:10:49,095
like and mine is like she gave

317
00:10:49,095 --> 00:10:50,625
like a list of things like you

318
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:51,915
know for me one of them is

319
00:10:51,975 --> 00:10:53,625
when you save somebody in the game

320
00:10:53,625 --> 00:10:54,705
and then they say it took you

321
00:10:54,735 --> 00:10:56,685
long enough for oh yeah like oh

322
00:10:56,685 --> 00:10:58,425
my god things had happened and i

323
00:10:58,425 --> 00:10:59,445
thought it was funny and i wrote

324
00:10:59,445 --> 00:11:02,025
back i am playing this one game

325
00:11:02,025 --> 00:11:03,615
right now and a named the game

326
00:11:03,645 --> 00:11:07,215
and it's it's full of long-winded characters

327
00:11:07,215 --> 00:11:08,535
that you have to listen to in

328
00:11:08,535 --> 00:11:10,485
order to get to the next thing

329
00:11:11,595 --> 00:11:12,135
and then fuck

330
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:14,625
the developer the or whoever created it

331
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:16,215
or whatever yeah somebody tagged the guy

332
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:19,605
oh man i just deleted the tweet

333
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:22,365
and hey yeah people tag the person

334
00:11:22,365 --> 00:11:23,745
yeah if you're just trying to do

335
00:11:23,745 --> 00:11:25,425
a funny thing or whatever or i've

336
00:11:25,425 --> 00:11:27,045
had people tag somebody on something i

337
00:11:27,045 --> 00:11:28,935
said on a podcast that was not

338
00:11:28,935 --> 00:11:31,065
even intended to be like a thing

339
00:11:31,095 --> 00:11:32,295
and then they're like yeah you said

340
00:11:32,325 --> 00:11:33,435
this about so and so and i'm

341
00:11:33,435 --> 00:11:34,665
like that's not even when i met

342
00:11:34,665 --> 00:11:35,745
and if you listen to the context

343
00:11:35,745 --> 00:11:37,305
that's not what i said and like

344
00:11:37,395 --> 00:11:39,135
the podcast was even worse because it's

345
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:40,455
like you may have recorded that months

346
00:11:40,455 --> 00:11:41,891
ago and you're like i don't remember

347
00:11:41,955 --> 00:11:44,505
remember what my mom obama oh but

348
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:46,065
my ballpark that's why we have this

349
00:11:46,155 --> 00:11:48,135
flanking rule here we don't remember anything

350
00:11:48,165 --> 00:11:50,115
that's exactly right not so anyway yes

351
00:11:50,115 --> 00:11:52,455
so i wrote to do

352
00:11:52,815 --> 00:11:53,595
so i wrote to me

353
00:11:54,945 --> 00:11:56,415
arena coming up so i wrote to

354
00:11:56,415 --> 00:11:59,385
the guy it said why did you

355
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:02,925
do that and he said um ah

356
00:12:02,955 --> 00:12:04,152
because he wrote the game and i

357
00:12:04,152 --> 00:12:06,015
was like i know yeah back part

358
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:08,115
of a understand why would you do

359
00:12:08,115 --> 00:12:09,855
that yeah i said to see a

360
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:11,835
friend of yours because i'm shit lord

361
00:12:11,835 --> 00:12:12,945
he said he's a very good friend

362
00:12:12,945 --> 00:12:14,415
of mine and i said

363
00:12:15,045 --> 00:12:16,755
why would you bring this to the

364
00:12:16,755 --> 00:12:18,643
attention of your good friends like well

365
00:12:18,643 --> 00:12:19,935
i think he would be tickled that

366
00:12:19,935 --> 00:12:22,215
you mentioned his game or whatever and

367
00:12:22,215 --> 00:12:23,475
it's like the guy doesn't follow me

368
00:12:23,475 --> 00:12:25,125
i don't think he's gonna find this

369
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:27,165
amusing and some person who doesn't know

370
00:12:27,165 --> 00:12:28,547

but what were you saying about jeopardy

540
00:18:31,515 --> 00:18:32,535
you want to say well i was

541
00:18:32,535 --> 00:18:34,095
thinking what if we actually have a

542
00:18:34,095 --> 00:18:35,175
friend who ah

543
00:18:35,475 --> 00:18:37,365
makes jeopardy games for like parties and

544
00:18:37,427 --> 00:18:40,005
like we parties for like the we

545
00:18:40,005 --> 00:18:40,965
have a little dinner party and then

546
00:18:40,965 --> 00:18:42,133
he put together a jeopardy game and

547
00:18:42,133 --> 00:18:43,125
we played it it was really good

548
00:18:43,275 --> 00:18:44,985
so like like we could make one

549
00:18:45,045 --> 00:18:47,265
like atlanta compete against each other on

550
00:18:47,265 --> 00:18:48,674
it with video and on a computer

551
00:18:49,155 --> 00:18:50,595
no no he just did with paper

552
00:18:50,655 --> 00:18:52,035
oh we could do it like but

553
00:18:52,065 --> 00:18:53,205
the person who makes it has to

554
00:18:53,205 --> 00:18:55,335

we we once found out that we

644
00:21:56,170 --> 00:21:58,510
equally were fascinated with judge judy the

645
00:21:58,510 --> 00:22:00,070
first season or whatever but she would

646
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:01,900
go and sit there that's so she

647
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:03,280
would sit there and she was right

648
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,920
behind the plaintiff several times where she's

649
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:08,080
just like that's so i think ryan

650
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,370
sofie can also be seen in many

651
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:11,350

00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:12,730

got to stop it because honestly though

1457
00:55:43,705 --> 00:55:45,175
is it because of the position that

1458
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:46,495
we're in that

1459
00:55:46,525 --> 00:55:47,515
if we were if we were like

1460
00:55:47,515 --> 00:55:48,865
standing in a circle it would be

1461
00:55:48,865 --> 00:55:50,365
a different thing but we're we're kind

1462
00:55:50,365 --> 00:55:52,585
of spread out from each other there's

1463
00:55:52,585 --> 00:55:54,445
the mix and everything i feel like

1464
00:55:54,475 --> 00:55:55,885
i feel like that does make a

1465
00:55:55,885 --> 00:55:59,095
difference yeah probably i mean i'm sure

1466
00:55:59,095 --> 00:56:00,325
we'd nail it if we were just

1467
00:56:00,325 --> 00:56:02,188

1468
00:56:02,188 --> 00:56:03,625
