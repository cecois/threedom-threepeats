that's impossible isn't though i'm not actually

104
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,070
considering the eiffel tower or eagle to

105
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:58,500
marry oh what would be standing in

106
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,900
the way of it like yuan marrying

107
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,120
anybody who cares part of yourself goes

108
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,850
i object but but there's no legal

109
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:07,950
thing to like there's no division of

110
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:09,330
assets or an airbrush

111
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:11,880
rules are you saying like if someone

112
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,316
wanted to say yes i'm married i'm

113
00:04:13,316 --> 00:04:15,090
married to myself is it the tax

114
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:16,410
break it must be the taxpayer i

115
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:18,090
think it's just that it's tedious and

116
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:19,740
people living like we're not gonna let

117
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:20,670
you do that so you can go

118
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:23,100
around saying that you married yourself it's

119
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,900
just so she leaped out of his

120
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:27,360
medium type in things that make no

121
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,800
sense because you just type everything wrong

122
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,520

123
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:31,950

by a person to themselves supporters of

128
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:44,010
the practice argue that it affirms one's

129
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:46,680
own value only just a happier life

130
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,780
an alternative term is self marriage but

131
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:49,680
this may also refer

132
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,900
to self uniting marriage with his merit

133
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:53,550
which is a marriage without you an

134
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:57,150

vegas that was all fake for a

163
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,710

to have proof that there was a

175
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:33,600
wedding and then because everything comes

176
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:34,950

480
00:17:10,875 --> 00:17:12,675
the real world like that like we

481
00:17:12,675 --> 00:17:15,315
were talking about disneyland true story

482
00:17:15,315 --> 00:17:17,265
a which i do miss and well

483
00:17:17,265 --> 00:17:19,935
i also really miss disneyland because every

484
00:17:19,935 --> 00:17:21,075
year i would take my nephews to

485
00:17:21,075 --> 00:17:22,395
disneyland and so we don't get to

486
00:17:22,395 --> 00:17:24,465
have our yearly trip where i spoiled

487
00:17:24,495 --> 00:17:25,935
do they get tired of it after

488
00:17:25,935 --> 00:17:27,195
a year is it like when i

489
00:17:27,195 --> 00:17:28,095
was a kid it was like every

490
00:17:28,095 --> 00:17:29,565
year yeah no way we've only done

491
00:17:29,565 --> 00:17:31,695
it twice and they were really excitable

492
00:17:31,695 --> 00:17:34,665
times and because their ages like their

493
00:17:34,665 --> 00:17:35,445
interests change

494
00:17:35,475 --> 00:17:37,335
each year they kind of do it

495
00:17:37,335 --> 00:17:39,105
a little differently or ordering in twenty

496
00:17:39,105 --> 00:17:43,515
one yeah they're seven and four but

497
00:17:43,995 --> 00:17:45,735
like so in previous years one of

498
00:17:45,735 --> 00:17:46,905
them was like a little too little

499
00:17:46,905 --> 00:17:49,125
for something and they both get really

500
00:17:49,125 --> 00:17:50,415
tired and cranky and like i'm thinking

501
00:17:50,415 --> 00:17:51,645
we're getting to the point where they'll

502
00:17:51,645 --> 00:17:53,265
start to get to a good age

503
00:17:53,265 --> 00:17:54,795
and they both just have fun enjoy

504
00:17:54,795 --> 00:17:55,305
it yeah

505
00:17:55,635 --> 00:17:58,665

564
00:19:39,435 --> 00:19:41,565

571
00:19:53,835 --> 00:19:55,275
blame me i was talking to my

572
00:19:55,275 --> 00:19:56,295

573
00:19:56,295 --> 00:19:56,745
was like

00:19:57,885 --> 00:19:59,115
are you safe from the fires i

575
00:19:59,115 --> 00:20:00,105

577
00:20:01,425 --> 00:20:03,465

because i never do them and i

819
00:27:58,405 --> 00:28:01,705

never do that like for so unpleasant

833
00:28:31,315 --> 00:28:32,755
title that i know i hate the

834
00:28:32,755 --> 00:28:33,145
neg one

835
00:28:33,265 --> 00:28:35,665
a younger it was routine yeah getting

836
00:28:35,665 --> 00:28:37,765
that drunk and then i did drunk

837
00:28:37,765 --> 00:28:39,865
history and had not been that drunk

838
00:28:40,225 --> 00:28:41,905
probably the last time i was that

839
00:28:41,905 --> 00:28:43,855
drunk was probably when my mom died

840
00:28:44,395 --> 00:28:45,955
when when i was like the first

841
00:28:45,955 --> 00:28:47,995
thanksgiving after my mom died and i

842
00:28:47,995 --> 00:28:50,035
was at my cousin's house which was

843
00:28:50,035 --> 00:28:51,385
our tradition as we would go over

844
00:28:51,385 --> 00:28:53,425
to their house for dessert and

845
00:28:53,425 --> 00:28:55,405
and they're a big family of drinkers

846
00:28:55,405 --> 00:28:56,875
and we're a big family of drinkers

847
00:28:57,175 --> 00:28:58,285
and so we would stay up to

848
00:28:58,285 --> 00:29:02,095
like the wee hours drinking beer and

849
00:29:02,425 --> 00:29:04,105
that night i was like hitting it

850
00:29:04,105 --> 00:29:06,745
real hard and i threw up and

851
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:08,725
i passed out and you know it

852
00:29:08,725 --> 00:29:09,805
was it was a mess where are

853
00:29:09,805 --> 00:29:12,145
you doing it sort of because it

854
00:29:12,145 --> 00:29:13,585
was your your mom

855
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:14,725
he had died or yeah i didn't

856
00:29:14,725 --> 00:29:15,985
realize it at the time and then

857
00:29:16,075 --> 00:29:17,305
the next day i was like i

858
00:29:17,305 --> 00:29:18,415
think i know why that happened

859
00:29:20,185 --> 00:29:21,715
but um so when i did drug

860
00:29:21,715 --> 00:29:23,425
history it was like ok no this

861
00:29:23,425 --> 00:29:24,625
is what i'm supposed to do but

862
00:29:24,625 --> 00:29:26,215
my mom has a died again so

863
00:29:26,335 --> 00:29:27,175
it's like kill my dad

864
00:29:28,675 --> 00:29:30,115
so i started drinking on an empty

865
00:29:30,115 --> 00:29:32,065
stomach you know before i went there

866
00:29:32,095 --> 00:29:35,035
and yeah yeah yeah wait so were

867
00:29:35,035 --> 00:29:36,265
you okay were you worried that you

868
00:29:36,265 --> 00:29:37,228
wouldn't be able to get drunk enough

869
00:29:37,228 --> 00:29:39,355
and the amount of time there or

870
00:29:39,355 --> 00:29:41,065
you just want it to i just

871
00:29:41,155 --> 00:29:44,065
i figured like that's what the thing

872
00:29:44,065 --> 00:29:46,345
was you know and so and i

873
00:29:46,345 --> 00:29:48,355
knew that they'd explained they explain like

874
00:29:48,385 --> 00:29:49,375
you're gonna tell the story like a

875
00:29:49,375 --> 00:29:52,225
bunch of times in varying states you

876
00:29:52,225 --> 00:29:53,965
know so you isn't your thing though

877
00:29:53,965 --> 00:29:55,585
it takes them a while to get

878
00:29:55,585 --> 00:29:56,755
set up and so a lot of

879
00:29:56,755 --> 00:29:58,465
people are way too drunk too early

880
00:29:59,395 --> 00:30:01,135
i heard that from a few people

881
00:30:01,135 --> 00:30:02,455
like i got way too drunk and

882
00:30:02,455 --> 00:30:04,045
then i had three more hours until

883
00:30:04,045 --> 00:30:06,565
we started filming there's no way around

884
00:30:06,565 --> 00:30:07,765
that by the way i think it's

885
00:30:07,765 --> 00:30:08,545
like we were

886
00:30:08,545 --> 00:30:09,235
we started

887
00:30:10,945 --> 00:30:13,016
they started filming they do like behind

888
00:30:13,016 --> 00:30:14,515
this the behind the scenes stuff when

889
00:30:14,515 --> 00:30:16,105
you're kind of getting you're in the

890
00:30:16,105 --> 00:30:18,325
process but like i i can see

891
00:30:18,325 --> 00:30:21,265
like me and derek in my episode

892
00:30:21,265 --> 00:30:23,725
we're talking in this kitchen and i

893
00:30:23,725 --> 00:30:26,515
can see that i'm already drunk yeah

894
00:30:26,845 --> 00:30:29,695
um you just arrived like hey paul

895
00:30:29,785 --> 00:30:29,995
now

896
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,600
what is one of the funny things

897
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:35,450
was i remember derek saying like you

898
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:36,590
know that's hard for me because i

899
00:30:36,590 --> 00:30:37,820
have to drink with the people and

900
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:38,900
it's like you don't have to

901
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:41,510
fine if you just told me no

902
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:44,090
one expects you to yeah that's funny

903
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:45,560
this whole show is just an excuse

904
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:45,770
for you

905
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:48,740
get drug every day but i got

906
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:52,220
i got blackout drunk i passed out

907
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,630
there's there's footage of me that i

908
00:30:53,630 --> 00:30:56,120
saw of me like sleeping on this

909
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:58,220
couch as they're clean up around me

910
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,590
like packing shit up and states tell

911
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:01,850
you like hey do you want this

912
00:31:01,850 --> 00:31:03,080
footage to be on the show or

913
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:04,856
not or do they are they just

914
00:31:04,856 --> 00:31:06,980
trying to put whatever they're embarrassing

915
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:09,530
thing they're allowed to but they're honestly

916
00:31:09,530 --> 00:31:12,170
they kind of they're very um protective

917
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:14,060
of people like yeah they know what's

918
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:16,580
funny and what's what's sad right so

919
00:31:16,610 --> 00:31:17,900
like i know one of the rules

920
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:20,570
was never show a woman throwing up

921
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:22,820
because it's not it's like seeing a

922
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:24,140
dude throw up is one thing but

923
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:25,880
seeing a woman throw up is like

924
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,080
just really more

925
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,060

i dropped it on the shuttle and

1011
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:25,850

say let's say you were in that

1035
00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:04,880
same position yeah in your life like

1036
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:09,080
twenty bucks was your bank that you

1037
00:35:09,530 --> 00:35:10,820
found a wallet and it had

1038
00:35:10,884 --> 00:35:12,110
one hundred dollars in it would you

1039
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:14,660

1040
00:35:14,690 --> 00:35:16,280
or what would i will say that

1041
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:20,210
that particular experience turned me around and

1042
00:35:20,210 --> 00:35:22,310
i said i will never if i

1043
00:35:22,310 --> 00:35:24,500
ever find anything i will just return

1044
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:26,330
it the way i found it i

1045
00:35:26,330 --> 00:35:27,650
won't take anything out of it because

1046
00:35:27,650 --> 00:35:28,760
i was like i was so grateful

1047
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:31,010
it saved me at that point yeah

1048
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,080
and i was like i i don't

1049
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:35,060
think i'd ever found anything you know

1050
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:36,800
like i've i found a random twenty

1051
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:37,790
dollars lying in the middle of the

1052
00:35:37,790 --> 00:35:39,260
street once but yeah there's no way

1053
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:41,090
to return that by put up a

1054
00:35:41,090 --> 00:35:44,300
sign but that's true any little industry

1055
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:46,250
anyone lose a twenty dollars and then

1056
00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:48,110
you just take all the calls paint

1057
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,870
and so on and they really rose

1058
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,120
what it looked like the letters on

1059
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:54,740
it i was like if it's in

1060
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:57,170
a wallet you must leave it in

1061
00:35:57,170 --> 00:35:58,850
the wallet yeah if you just see

1062
00:35:58,850 --> 00:36:00,320

00:38:25,039 --> 00:38:27,800
say their locations sigh as you the

1129
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,630
secret service is protecting them and why

1130
00:38:29,630 --> 00:38:32,390

1131
00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:34,640

1133
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,910

the page records oh i love storybook

1140
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:54,560
record yeah they're great but i was

1141
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,180
like but mom there's no reason to

00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,310

1143
00:38:58,310 --> 00:38:59,660

00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:00,710
what if i ever want to look

1145
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:02,029
at them or listen to them i'm

1146
00:39:02,029 --> 00:39:03,740
like yeah listen to them but that's

1147
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:04,910
the thing is is like you feel

1148
00:39:04,910 --> 00:39:06,800
so connected to something from your youth

1149
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:07,610
i was like what if we just

1150
00:39:07,610 --> 00:39:09,525
took pictures of these things well kid

1151
00:39:09,525 --> 00:39:10,850
maybe nice too but i do feel

1152
00:39:10,850 --> 00:39:12,860
like with stuff like that i'm more

1153
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:14,630
likely to keep it than clothing like

1154
00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:16,370

1155
00:39:16,370 --> 00:39:18,140

00:39:19,430 --> 00:39:22,550
things that my mom has saved but

1158
00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:24,260
part of it is that part of

1159
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:25,520
the reason why i'm ok with it

1160
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:26,990
is because they've been really well preserved

1161
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:31,520
like i have chautauqua wow we have

00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:33,230

whatever like i liked them but it's

1191
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:39,020
a weird thing to have like all

00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:40,520
of this stuff man yeah there's there's

1193
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:40,760
a lot of

1194
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:45,040
and of i finally learned that lesson

1195
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:47,800
where it's like you know you sort

1196
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:48,820
of if you have a box of

1197
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:50,830
old stuff you sort of look at

1198
00:40:50,830 --> 00:40:53,440
it and then you realize yeah okay

1199
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:54,790
i saw it again now i'm done

1200
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:57,010
you know they're they're thing i like

1201
00:40:57,140 --> 00:40:58,990
like what's something that you could get

1202
00:40:58,990 --> 00:41:00,220
rid of and want something you keep

1203
00:41:00,610 --> 00:41:01,660
honestly there were things

1204
00:41:01,810 --> 00:41:03,130
i was i was a person who

1205
00:41:03,130 --> 00:41:04,810
would keep a lot of things for

1206
00:41:04,810 --> 00:41:07,217
sentiment like ticket stubs and fats like

1207
00:41:07,307 --> 00:41:09,250
i do that birthday cards yeah and

1208
00:41:09,250 --> 00:41:10,780
then i would like a ticket like

1209
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:12,370
just a ticket like a raffle type

1210
00:41:12,370 --> 00:41:13,840
ticket and i'm like i don't know

1211
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:16,060
what this fucking is yeah i've no

1212
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:18,370
idea but this was whatever this was

1213
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,800
it was extremely important to me yeah

1214
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:21,820
it's connected to some

1215
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:23,830
a girl that i loved or whatever

1216
00:41:24,070 --> 00:41:25,600
and now i can't remember at all

1217
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:29,140
but a harder thing is like paper

1218
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:30,250
stuff is very easy for me to

1219
00:41:30,250 --> 00:41:32,830
get rid of objects are harder for

1220
00:41:32,830 --> 00:41:35,080
me if it's like a a weird

1221
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:36,880
little anywhere little totem for when i

1222
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:38,650
was a kid and then i think

1223
00:41:38,650 --> 00:41:40,690
about like toys that i loved when

1224
00:41:40,690 --> 00:41:41,470
i was a kid

1225
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:43,270
like it'll pop up in a movie

1226
00:41:43,270 --> 00:41:44,230
or something it's like oh my god

1227
00:41:44,230 --> 00:41:45,460
i used to have that and i

1228
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:47,320
think i could get that now just

1229
00:41:47,350 --> 00:41:48,910
like yeah right what what would that

1230
00:41:48,910 --> 00:41:51,160
be like to have that in my

1231
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:53,620
field of vision whenever i wanted to

1232
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:55,240
remind me of whatever at a certain

1233
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:56,650

nobody you know what it is i

1237
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:02,114
realized it's the feeling

1238
00:42:02,170 --> 00:42:03,790
of i want to hold that thing

1239
00:42:03,790 --> 00:42:06,190
again right yeah that i remember from

1240
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:07,360
like when i was when i was

1288
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:38,650
like ever go to used bookstores and

1289
00:43:38,650 --> 00:43:40,900
buy like all the classic literature that

1290
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:44,500
i've never read and and teach myself

1291
00:43:44,590 --> 00:43:46,330
you know and then what happened so

1292
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:48,460
i i i would then like

1293
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:49,840
like everywhere i went go to a

1294
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:52,570
used bookstore and look through these certain

1295
00:43:52,570 --> 00:43:54,400
authors and find these books and stuff

1296
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:55,600
and so i had a huge collection

1297
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:57,820
of books that when we moved here

1298
00:43:57,820 --> 00:43:59,530
i was like i just looked through

1299
00:43:59,530 --> 00:44:00,520
them and i was like you know

1300
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:04,390
what i have literally had this collected

1301
00:44:04,390 --> 00:44:07,540
edition of plato for thirty years have

1302
00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:08,620
never cracked it open

1303
00:44:08,620 --> 00:44:10,000
and yeah it's safe to say i'm

1304
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,350
not going to read this yeah yeah

1305
00:44:11,380 --> 00:44:13,000
yeah yeah you know so i just

1306
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:15,070
i don't end up freeing like i

1307
00:44:15,070 --> 00:44:17,890
feel like absolutely things like homework things

1308
00:44:17,890 --> 00:44:20,050
that you bought and then you're like

1309
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:21,310
i need to let it go that

1310
00:44:21,310 --> 00:44:23,470
feels good because it's just it looms

1311
00:44:23,772 --> 00:44:24,460
and then when you see it on

1312
00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:26,110
the shelf like i'm gonna get to

1313
00:44:26,110 --> 00:44:28,060
that i got a complete set of

1314
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:28,780
homework and

1315
00:44:28,780 --> 00:44:31,060
i was like i don't want to

1316
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:32,320
do this well you like to go

1317
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:33,940
to colleges and pay for paper yes

1318
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:35,105
i do pay for people to write

1319
00:44:35,110 --> 00:44:36,460
space for you even though you're not

1320
00:44:36,460 --> 00:44:38,650
absolute yeah i think we might talk

1321
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:40,090
about that but i do know someone

1322
00:44:40,090 --> 00:44:42,130
who does that he he's paid to

1323
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:44,770
write people really is your husband i

1324
00:44:44,950 --> 00:44:45,580
know but it could be

1325
00:44:46,930 --> 00:44:48,910
like a random thing that she's like

1326
00:44:48,910 --> 00:44:50,972
a side-hustle for him i will say

1327
00:44:51,370 --> 00:44:52,300
one of the things when i was

1328
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:54,280
moving my parents when i was like

1329
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:56,140
looking through all of their stuff and

1330
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:59,410
i i found a lot of mementos

1331
00:44:59,410 --> 00:45:01,570
like newspapers and stuff and i found

1332
00:45:01,570 --> 00:45:04,060
one moment i found that was the

1333
00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:05,350
other thing if i was ever in

1334
00:45:05,350 --> 00:45:06,940
the holroyd of joe pantoliano

1335
00:45:06,940 --> 00:45:08,650
oh so do not trust him don't

1336
00:45:08,650 --> 00:45:10,450
believe his lies if i was ever

1337
00:45:10,450 --> 00:45:12,730
in the newspaper they bought six copies

1338
00:45:12,730 --> 00:45:15,430
and kept six comics yeah kept them

1339
00:45:15,430 --> 00:45:17,560
yeah so i was like it's nice

1340
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:18,610
to have a hard copy of a

1341
00:45:18,610 --> 00:45:20,170
thing you were in yeah but i

1342
00:45:20,170 --> 00:45:21,850
feel like i don't have the dedication

1343
00:45:21,850 --> 00:45:23,680
to cut it out yeah i do

1344
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:24,430
think you'd be better if it was

1345
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:25,960
cutting capitals they would keep the entire

1346
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:27,070
paper oh i mean i have

1347
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:28,720
