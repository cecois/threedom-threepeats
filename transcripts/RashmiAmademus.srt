pretty specific problem i guess eau de

134
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:42,000
festa number one reason they asked you

135
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,050
to fast is because yeah i don't

136
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:44,520

137
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:46,770

138
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:48,750
things problem um i had a dog

139
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:50,790
question i have a doctor once do

140
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,830
it and and he was talking to

141
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:54,180
me while he was doing it and

142
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:55,740
then after it was like see i

143
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,300
talked to you to distract you from

144
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,500
ah you know what was going on

145
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,820
i was like yeah i got it

146
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:02,580
yeah and i was pretty hyper focused

147
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:04,230
on what was happening yeah it didn't

148
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:06,390
quite work but i appreciate the effort

149
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:09,780
so yeah that a squeaky toy and

150
00:05:09,811 --> 00:05:11,400
was like two in front of your

151
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,540
face jingling

152
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:15,810
so in terms of fainting yeah fucking

153
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:18,150
painting yeah i faint i have fainted

154
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:20,430
i think twice and almost fainted a

155
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:22,020
couple more times but it was all

156
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:23,430
kind of in the same period of

157
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:24,932
life i'm not mistaken it was all

158
00:05:24,932 --> 00:05:26,820
like when i was like sixteen seventeen

159
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:29,430
years old and it was happening one

160
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:30,960
time i was at a funeral and

161
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,430
it was really hot and a lot

162
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:33,120
of people were fainting

163
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,890
ng which is really wow do you

164
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,292
think it was a combination of the

165
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:38,070
motion and the heat or was it

166
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:39,870
purely just heat i think i mean

167
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,580
motion of the funeral i'm sure people

168
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,440
i'm sure being sad i don't know

169
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,580
if that makes you faint it was

170
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,540
you know what i mean like people

171
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:47,550
hyperventilating crying you'll make but yeah it

172
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:49,290
was really hot in this church and

173
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:51,480
really packed and so it was there

174
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,100
was an officer luther came up

175
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:54,870
yeah it was sorry that we talked

176
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:56,520
it was the only person that good

177
00:05:56,550 --> 00:05:58,230
tracks and a lot of people from

178
00:05:58,230 --> 00:06:01,380
martin luther king yeah luther king martin

179
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:03,120
luther king and the timing was passed

180
00:06:03,124 --> 00:06:06,180
down to mcdonalds and then because you

181
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:07,830
wanted it so bad or because i

182
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:09,570
was really hungry wait to me i

183
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:11,418
think i was hypoglycemic at that time

184
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,350
probably at that time hypos

185
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,097
assuming yeah you're shouldn't change yeah anyway

186
00:06:16,121 --> 00:06:17,400
was nice

187
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:19,320

they would have been there were younger

439
00:14:39,025 --> 00:14:40,735
than me i think it's when they

440
00:14:40,735 --> 00:14:42,055
got to high school they went eighth

441
00:14:42,055 --> 00:14:44,425
grade or something like that i remember

442
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:46,390
till younger than you know no they

443
00:14:47,485 --> 00:14:48,865
wow they're about to pull a hit

444
00:14:49,015 --> 00:14:50,305

yeah but i decided to stay in

451
00:15:02,185 --> 00:15:04,135
the real world like she's spending to

452
00:15:04,135 --> 00:15:06,025

00:15:06,025 --> 00:15:07,765
dew arms of mass mountain dew yeah

454
00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:12,595
um ah and i remember someone telling

455
00:15:12,595 --> 00:15:15,775
a group of us that these girls

456
00:15:15,865 --> 00:15:16,465

457
00:15:16,555 --> 00:15:19,555
like at this you know fair or

458
00:15:19,555 --> 00:15:21,835
something they snuck off with these guys

and did all this stuff and and

460
00:15:23,247 --> 00:15:24,775
and like at the time i believed

461
00:15:24,775 --> 00:15:27,235
it and then later realising like that

462
00:15:27,235 --> 00:15:29,215

00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,860
say that i mean why don't i

741
00:25:28,890 --> 00:25:31,350
just learned something oh what's that my

742
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:32,970
friend just had a baby and she

743
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,230
and the baby has a little red

744
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:35,910
mark on his face oh he says

745
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:37,200
called a stark bite yeah i've heard

746
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,760
of that i haven't heard over neck

747
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:41,850
that phrase yeah and i thought that's

748
00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:43,530
kind of q and so it makes

749
00:25:43,530 --> 00:25:43,980
me think that

750
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:46,170
apple didn't use that enough to make

751
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:48,060
that well how do they explain the

752
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:51,690
mother's change in size but didn't like

753
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:52,830
well i guess it's like how the

754
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:53,550
you don't want to say how it

755
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:56,970
came out so yeah like the mom's

756
00:25:56,970 --> 00:25:58,050
gonna go to the hospital in the

757
00:25:58,050 --> 00:26:01,110
store comes and brings the baby right

758
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:02,910
but how do you explain that the

759
00:26:02,910 --> 00:26:04,230
mother is growing in size ove

760
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:05,280
over the course of nine moles the

761
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,240
stork isn't there

762
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:10,110
that never occurred no way i've thought

763
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:11,580
because the image is always the stork

764
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:13,860
flying with a with a diaper is

765
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:15,987
it from the fifties only or i

766
00:26:15,987 --> 00:26:17,100
think it goes back further than that

767
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:18,570
yeah i think kids are too polite

768
00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:20,670
to talk about mom's weight so they

769
00:26:20,670 --> 00:26:23,430
assume she's really kids are notoriously polite

770
00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:25,080
that's true they never call out things

771
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,040
that are abi i don't want to

772
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,510
bring this huge never coming

773
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:29,580
some people sensitive about this issue

774
00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:32,880

usually by the time she grows enough

830
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:26,670
to wear these

831
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:28,020
you will have to wear them eventually

832
00:28:28,050 --> 00:28:30,450

nice enough to send a video boxing

00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:43,740
video yes it was so cute as

839
00:28:43,770 --> 00:28:45,540
a little dress which we have the

840
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:46,950
cheat but she saw

841
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:51,090
seemed to like better the she liked

842
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:53,250
the plastic bag that the clasping came

843
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:54,510
in and set it on her head

844
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:56,310
as like a hat but also like

845
00:28:56,310 --> 00:28:57,480
that she did open something up but

846
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,800
she turned her back to the camera

847
00:28:58,800 --> 00:28:59,880
miles davis style

848
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:02,880
eddie van halen said it was real

849
00:29:02,883 --> 00:29:04,590
he turns right because he would always

850
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:05,640
turn his back to the audience so

851
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,560
no one could tell what his technique

852
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,960
was because it was so revolutionary and

853
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,670
then everyone copied it once they actually

854
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:13,140
were able to figure out what like

855
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:14,280
the job of the audience around

856
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:17,310

894
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:32,520
yeah it's really i didn't have to

895
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:34,710
scroll it's really crazy how everyone tries

896
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:36,960
to control everyone on yeah i mean

897
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:39,370
like when i first put holly in

898
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:41,291
the carseat i was doing it wrong

899
00:30:41,291 --> 00:30:43,030
in a friend message me and told

900
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:44,380
me that i was like that's helpful

901
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:46,180
that's the way yes like but i'm

902
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:47,290
like at a certain point i think

903
00:30:47,290 --> 00:30:48,340
people know what they're doing it was

904
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:50,380
like right one yeah exactly what were

905
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:52,600
you doing wrong the chest clip was

906
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,490
too low this is the common comment

907
00:30:54,490 --> 00:30:55,390
and i'll say it here in case

908
00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:56,980
anyone doesn't know this it should be

909
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:57,910
between their armpits

910
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:59,980
because in in case of an accident

911
00:31:00,010 --> 00:31:01,270
it protects your chest and it wouldn't

912
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:03,580
go into their you know that way

913
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:05,920
so it's helps keep on hearing right

914
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:08,200
back yeah i mean people should know

915
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,640

i have no idea i don't remember

1040
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,420
but it was just one of those

1041
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:11,766
like things that made me

1042
00:35:11,830 --> 00:35:13,900
go like hey i should stop please

00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:16,478
i mean auditioning maybe doing things to

1044
00:35:16,478 --> 00:35:18,970
make you go maybe just up um

1045
00:35:19,330 --> 00:35:21,220
because things like that are like unless

1046
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:24,340
it's a specific physical type that yeah

1047
00:35:24,370 --> 00:35:26,590
stipulated in the script right which it

1048
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:28,750
wasn't but i think she just who

1049
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:30,400
knows maybe i was too tall too

1050
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,990
intimidating to me

1051
00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:34,510
manly too cool right yeah yeah those

1052
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:36,940
are your issues i did i again

1053
00:35:36,970 --> 00:35:39,070
had one of those i just wrote

1054
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:41,260
part like that again years later oh

1055
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:41,770
my god

1056
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:45,760
so this was an audition for a

1057
00:35:45,790 --> 00:35:50,618
ah semi scripted sitcom about relationships so

1058
00:35:50,618 --> 00:35:51,790
it was all these different couples and

1059
00:35:51,790 --> 00:35:55,120
everything and this was shortly after i

1060
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:56,200
got back from new york i was

1061
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:58,360
getting back into auditioning again and everything

1062
00:35:59,110 --> 00:36:00,700
and i remember sitting in the waiting

1063
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,650
room i was the only person there

1064
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:07,090
and then someone that we know walked

1065
00:36:07,090 --> 00:36:10,210
out of there ah and said to

1066
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:10,720
me

1067
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:15,910
run ah whoa run run and i

1068
00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:18,430
went what he goes seriously just go

1069
00:36:19,450 --> 00:36:22,450
whoa and i did not and i

1070
00:36:22,450 --> 00:36:25,780
was called in experience i i started

1071
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:27,970
reading this part and the guy who

1072
00:36:27,970 --> 00:36:29,260
is the creator of the show is

1073
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:31,450
giving me direction with bad direction and

1074
00:36:31,450 --> 00:36:31,990
the casting

1075
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:34,690
a person i could tell was like

1076
00:36:34,690 --> 00:36:36,190
trying to deal with this guy and

1077
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:38,800
embarrass i don't think he might be

1078
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:41,350
i don't think um you know he

1079
00:36:41,350 --> 00:36:43,030
might be too kind of intelligent for

1080
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:45,340
read too intelligent for this part so

1081
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:46,780
maybe he could read the other part

1082
00:36:47,290 --> 00:36:50,457
and the guy was like um yeah

1083
00:36:50,457 --> 00:36:51,790
oh right and then i read it

1084
00:36:51,790 --> 00:36:52,108
and it was

1085
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:54,250
like this guy was clearly like did

1086
00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:55,870
not know what he was doing it

1087
00:36:55,870 --> 00:36:58,688
was really it was so obvious right

1088
00:36:58,688 --> 00:37:00,366
and this was his second show oh

1089
00:37:00,366 --> 00:37:02,410
wow and i think his last i

1090
00:37:02,410 --> 00:37:04,510
don't think this one went i need

1091
00:37:04,510 --> 00:37:06,490
to know who this is and if

1092
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:08,170
he's ever done a new obstacle course

1093
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:10,780

00:37:10,810 --> 00:37:12,310
