158
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:54,060
soon after father's day such a vollmer

00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,200
gift to a dad i think it

161
00:05:58,230 --> 00:05:59,999

162
00:05:59,999 --> 00:06:03,120
oh no no no no racecar bottle

163
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:04,650

164
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:06,330
i just get him like i mean

165
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:07,740
i'm getting a little more creative now

166
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:09,570
but it's it feels like when i

167
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:10,644
was growing up it was like wow

168
00:06:10,644 --> 00:06:12,030
what do you get your dad it's

169
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:15,360
like sex toy well hey guys here's

170
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:15,810
why i would

171
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,371
strange here's what i would call them

172
00:06:17,371 --> 00:06:18,660
and never got him a gift when

173
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:19,680
i was a little kid probably i

174
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,270
did yeah yeah but i would call

175
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:23,220
him to have an awkward conversation with

176
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:24,630
this weird man

177
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:29,100
as your dad's personality is zero like

178
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,780
just like nobody say on the phone

179
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:32,910
like hi paul it was just it

180
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:34,920
was awkward iso just awkward it was

181
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:37,080
like hey son you call me son

182
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,870
yeah yeah and it all led up

183
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:41,670
to me saying i love you at

184
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:43,020
the end and then wondering what he

185
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:44,610
was gonna say back and what were

186
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:45,840
some options like just now

187
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,410
nothing ah thank you oh yeah i

188
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:53,125
appreciate that oh wow some jeans you

189
00:06:53,125 --> 00:06:56,160
love you i'm gonna say probably yes

190
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,630
he did say at one time and

191
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:59,040
i was totally unprepared for it because

192
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,020
i had friends and house and it

193
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,100
was father's day i was like oh

194
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,840
shit i gotta call my dad and

195
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,980
i called him and have the awkward

196
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:06,000
conversation that i say

197
00:07:06,001 --> 00:07:07,230
said i love you dad and he

198
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:08,730
said well i love you too and

199
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:09,900
then i was like oh no i'm

200
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,700
gonna die yes so there's people here

201
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:15,690
wow well that definitely that definitely so

202
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:18,240
he just he didn't say it there

203
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,200
was one year where he loved it

204
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:21,510
he couldn't say it he couldn't he

205
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:23,130
was from a different time is from

206
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:24,990
a different tie when they didn't say

207
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:26,760
those kinds of things it was it

208
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,650
was it truly like what's the cutoff

209
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:31,110
for people who would never like age

210
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:32,880
cut-off of the generation

211
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,400
and who fathers were not would never

212
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,290
say i love you that is a

213
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:40,320
thing isn't it yeah i think it's

214
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,180
i think it i think it depends

215
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:44,100
on i don't think it depends on

216
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,200
your generation i think it depends on

217
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,420
how you were raised yeah maybe i

218
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:49,530
think it was prob but i i

219
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:51,150
do think that was probably more common

220
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:52,890
my dad was great yeah yeah

221
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,480
and it was probably more common i

222
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,250
also think that there's a gender thing

223
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:58,380
where he could probably say more easily

224
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:00,780
to my sisters oh yeah my brothers

225
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,670
right yeah um but it's weird to

226
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:04,530
think that there's still people out there

227
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:07,590
now like people like our age that

228
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:09,480
are that can't do that yeah i

229
00:08:09,485 --> 00:08:11,970
can't say i like your psycho yeah

230
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,200
like that's interesting

231
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:15,600
yeah my focus or where or how

232
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,280
they were there definitely are tons of

233
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,050
people like that yeah but i mean

234
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:20,700
i do feel like we and i

235
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,020
want here we're gonna say but i

236
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:23,730
do feel like we need a neutral

237
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:26,670
live in a in a community of

238
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:30,120
people who are more open about feelings

239
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:32,070
as the joker said we live in

240
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:33,120
a society

241
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:35,070
he said it in the snyder cut

242
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:37,435
trailer but not in the movie earlier

243
00:08:37,442 --> 00:08:38,580
was just too much good stuff to

244
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:39,540
put in the movie so they had

245
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:40,800
to put some in the trailer it's

246
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,720
like he's trolling people by putting that

247
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,220
in a trailer when he has no

248
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:45,690
intention to put a unit yeah i

249
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:47,430
don't know since i've i i did

250
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:48,660
think it was funny that instantly people

251
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:51,420
started sharing george costanza gifts

252
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:54,000
i was just gonna say that i

253
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,280
think i've note i noticed especially um

254
00:08:56,310 --> 00:09:00,210
um the day of trans is where

255
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:02,130
we transfer well to yes visibility day

256
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,620
that a lot of my comedian like

257
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:07,500
improviser friends who are men who are

258
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,090
older than me were posting about it

259
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:10,110
and i thought this is so cool

260
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:12,690
because this is like i

261
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,130
just thought like yeah you should but

262
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:15,840
i also was going i bet you

263
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,610
there's so many men of that age

264
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:19,560
who would not post something like this

265
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,000
yeah and so i really feel really

266
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,410
grateful to be in a community of

267
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:25,080
people who are like you know cool

268
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:28,530
and aware and like um you know

269
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:30,450
it's not even progressive also woke don't

270
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:32,220
say woke i certainly wouldn't say that

271
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:35,970
i don't use that word but i

272
00:09:36,136 --> 00:09:38,610
i i yeah you use the great

273
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:41,070
awakening doing you woke has been ruined

274
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:43,366
in any context forever yes yeah i

275
00:09:43,384 --> 00:09:45,720
know and i like everyone i also

276
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:48,480
think about things no weren't appropriated take

277
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,880
anything fake news woke whatever turned into

278
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,620
an insult and then it just ruins

279
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:52,980
it forever

280
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:54,300
you know i was very bad and

281
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,110
lauren i wanna hear what you have

282
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:57,060
to say i was i was very

283
00:09:57,060 --> 00:10:01,170
embarrassed recently because the the phrase lives

284
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:03,990
rent-free in my head yeah has been

285
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:07,230
co-opted by bad people yeah to mean

286
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:09,540
the absolute opposite of what it suppose

287
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:11,460
so what does it what does what

288
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:13,200
explains be positive it's like

289
00:10:13,908 --> 00:10:17,445
love thinking about that little yeah it

290
00:10:17,445 --> 00:10:19,455
started as positive yeah everyone of course

291
00:10:19,455 --> 00:10:21,996
it comes from the african-american communities and

292
00:10:22,005 --> 00:10:24,255
the people were never like white republicans

293
00:10:24,285 --> 00:10:25,965
took it to mean like you think

294
00:10:25,965 --> 00:10:27,345
about trump all the time he lives

295
00:10:27,345 --> 00:10:29,535
rent free in your head oh interests

296
00:10:29,535 --> 00:10:32,235
so stupid yeah i hate us i'd

297
00:10:32,235 --> 00:10:33,495
like to pay rent to things like

298
00:10:33,495 --> 00:10:34,035
this

299
00:10:34,365 --> 00:10:36,045
exactly

300
00:10:37,185 --> 00:10:38,505
well anyway you were just saying that

301
00:10:38,505 --> 00:10:39,945
there's probably men your age who are

302
00:10:39,945 --> 00:10:41,145
like afraid to say i love you

303
00:10:41,145 --> 00:10:42,765
but i feel like i was just

304
00:10:42,765 --> 00:10:44,505
thinking like looking at our community it's

305
00:10:44,505 --> 00:10:46,095
pretty cool like i feel like i

306
00:10:46,095 --> 00:10:49,185
also just wonder if that's an improviser

307
00:10:49,425 --> 00:10:51,225
trait like i was i was looking

308
00:10:51,225 --> 00:10:52,575
at these posts that i was saying

309
00:10:52,575 --> 00:10:54,495
i was thinking like wow these people

310
00:10:54,495 --> 00:10:57,105
are like awesome and like

311
00:10:57,705 --> 00:10:58,395
i don't know do you know i'm

312
00:10:58,395 --> 00:11:00,345
going with this yeah totally hey it

313
00:11:00,345 --> 00:11:01,905
was just especially when you're in comedy

314
00:11:01,905 --> 00:11:04,545
and everything is like so everyone's so

315
00:11:04,545 --> 00:11:06,645
afraid to be earnest yeah right doing

316
00:11:06,645 --> 00:11:08,505
yeah yeah yeah everyone's doing bits back

317
00:11:08,505 --> 00:11:11,325
so yeah having like real conversations yeah

318
00:11:11,415 --> 00:11:13,635
i i do think that that probably

319
00:11:13,635 --> 00:11:15,615
over the last year to helicopter yeah

320
00:11:15,615 --> 00:11:17,355
yeah looking for tom law

321
00:11:17,955 --> 00:11:23,205
zama zama yeah i do think that

322
00:11:23,265 --> 00:11:24,945
especially over the last year people are

323
00:11:24,945 --> 00:11:27,345
more probably more comfortable with being sincere

324
00:11:27,705 --> 00:11:29,295
making that too you know it's just

325
00:11:29,295 --> 00:11:30,465
like we've had a lot of time

326
00:11:30,465 --> 00:11:33,825
to look inward yeah and and also

327
00:11:33,825 --> 00:11:36,615
realize what's important and you know maybe

328
00:11:36,615 --> 00:11:37,635
that's come into sharper folk

329
00:11:37,635 --> 00:11:39,285
this for a lot of us your

00:11:39,285 --> 00:11:41,349

oh my god and they fired and

373
00:13:13,493 --> 00:13:15,075
it like jammed or something and then

374
00:13:15,075 --> 00:13:18,375
he was able to like sora buying

375
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:21,525
your sly shotgun ammo my god so

376
00:13:21,525 --> 00:13:23,385
he was like that's the closest thing

377
00:13:23,475 --> 00:13:27,285
terrifying but i really think that we

378
00:13:27,285 --> 00:13:29,325
should have we should still have wars

379
00:13:29,355 --> 00:13:31,875
but they for the hell yeah they

380
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:34,065
should be fought entirely by robots yeah

381
00:13:34,095 --> 00:13:35,925
that would be nice in a designated

382
00:13:35,925 --> 00:13:38,625
area boxing robots and make it fun

383
00:13:38,625 --> 00:13:39,765
well i think they can shoot each

384
00:13:39,765 --> 00:13:40,845
other and blow each other up well

385
00:13:40,845 --> 00:13:42,555
sure but no one else like boxing

386
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:43,635
gloves fly off there

387
00:13:43,665 --> 00:13:46,335
like missiles are disconnected from the wrist

388
00:13:46,365 --> 00:13:47,865
i just feel like no matter how

389
00:13:47,865 --> 00:13:50,385
much i think about war i still

390
00:13:50,385 --> 00:13:52,305
have the mentality of like my five-year-old

391
00:13:52,305 --> 00:13:53,685
self or i'm just like why are

392
00:13:53,685 --> 00:13:58,875
we doing stupid be stupid and love

393
00:13:58,875 --> 00:14:01,335
means nothing what's that it's a culture

394
00:14:01,335 --> 00:14:02,895
club song that was like dead

395
00:14:05,295 --> 00:14:07,682
like whatever it was or is whoa

396
00:14:07,695 --> 00:14:09,615
are stupid it's called the war song

397
00:14:09,735 --> 00:14:11,861
and it's just so damn wars yeah

398
00:14:11,865 --> 00:14:13,245
it's so bad it sounds dumb and

399
00:14:13,485 --> 00:14:17,445
like nothing in some strange reason or

400
00:14:17,445 --> 00:14:18,015
something like that

401
00:14:19,305 --> 00:14:20,655
yeah just so weird so here's the

402
00:14:20,655 --> 00:14:23,055
fight over territory it's like what but

403
00:14:23,085 --> 00:14:24,638
you literally are gonna die she thought

404
00:14:24,672 --> 00:14:26,985
was robot wars right now i like

405
00:14:27,045 --> 00:14:28,695
being robot zana when it was settled

406
00:14:28,695 --> 00:14:30,285
by the robots yes then it would

407
00:14:30,285 --> 00:14:31,515
be and everyone had to abide by

408
00:14:31,515 --> 00:14:32,475
it it would be like it would

409
00:14:32,475 --> 00:14:33,675
be like sports it would be like

410
00:14:33,675 --> 00:14:35,505
fun for the world where it's like

411
00:14:35,505 --> 00:14:36,795
well you lost so we get this

412
00:14:36,795 --> 00:14:39,315
land right um for like this

413
00:14:39,315 --> 00:14:40,815
amount of time or whatever but isn't

414
00:14:40,815 --> 00:14:42,165
worry about oppression

415
00:14:43,995 --> 00:14:47,145
well yeah not necessarily land that well

416
00:14:47,145 --> 00:14:48,945
but but the but it is by

417
00:14:48,945 --> 00:14:50,595
when the robots but that's about it

418
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:51,945
yeah that's part of it but yeah

419
00:14:51,975 --> 00:14:53,685
you oppress you you gather the land

420
00:14:53,685 --> 00:14:55,875
and oppress the people um i don't

421
00:14:56,025 --> 00:14:57,285
i don't know that look i'm not

422
00:14:57,285 --> 00:14:59,085
saying wars grade i'm just saying i

423
00:14:59,085 --> 00:14:59,805
don't think it's going to be a

424
00:14:59,805 --> 00:15:02,175
lot more function yeah just think robots

425
00:15:02,175 --> 00:15:03,525
could really do it well i think

426
00:15:03,555 --> 00:15:05,685
robots this is their chance to shine

427
00:15:05,715 --> 00:15:07,695
but here but why fight each other

428
00:15:07,695 --> 00:15:09,405
not us what if the giant robots

429
00:15:09,435 --> 00:15:11,085
and i'm assuming they're giant oh i

430
00:15:11,085 --> 00:15:14,265
wasn't there but they're fighting guns what

431
00:15:14,265 --> 00:15:17,085
if suddenly a title members right

432
00:15:17,745 --> 00:15:19,065
what if a titan emerges from the

433
00:15:19,065 --> 00:15:20,895
water like a good sky yeah i

434
00:15:20,895 --> 00:15:23,595
do can they fight in the war

435
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:24,825
i mean they're just as big as

436
00:15:24,825 --> 00:15:27,255
the robots can we then enlisted to

437
00:15:27,255 --> 00:15:29,175
fight in the diner they done well

438
00:15:29,175 --> 00:15:30,915
that's just god i'm trying to talk

439
00:15:30,915 --> 00:15:32,205
real stuff and you're living in a

440
00:15:32,205 --> 00:15:35,565
fantasy land i started watching godzilla vs

441
00:15:35,565 --> 00:15:37,875
kong and kong to you

442
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:39,015
you feel absolutely

443
00:15:40,635 --> 00:15:43,305
it's majesty i was enjoying myself the

444
00:15:43,305 --> 00:15:44,895
only thing was i felt like khan

445
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:47,835
looks more real than godzilla i was

446
00:15:47,835 --> 00:15:50,625
buying it more when i entered the

447
00:15:50,625 --> 00:15:51,915
water i was going and i don't

448
00:15:51,915 --> 00:15:53,745
know about that well gods because king

449
00:15:53,775 --> 00:15:55,155
kong is just a bigger version of

450
00:15:55,155 --> 00:15:57,375
a thing that actually exists yeah godzilla

451
00:15:57,375 --> 00:15:59,205
is like a made up thing he's

452
00:15:59,205 --> 00:16:00,165
a made up thing but

453
00:16:00,195 --> 00:16:02,265
i also just have always loved practical

454
00:16:02,265 --> 00:16:04,365
effects like i feel like yeah if

455
00:16:04,365 --> 00:16:07,515
it was just like just a less

456
00:16:07,635 --> 00:16:10,155
amazing shot of godzilla but he was

457
00:16:10,185 --> 00:16:13,665
real looking just like sinister early floating

458
00:16:13,665 --> 00:16:15,225
to the water i just said head

459
00:16:15,225 --> 00:16:17,115
with yeah open mouth that can't do

460
00:16:17,145 --> 00:16:19,845
anything yeah i mean the not to

461
00:16:19,845 --> 00:16:20,295
bring up

462
00:16:20,655 --> 00:16:21,945
a sore subject because you're not in

463
00:16:21,945 --> 00:16:23,745
the franchise anymore but i'm still in

464
00:16:23,745 --> 00:16:26,532
the franchise actually just snide not considering

465
00:16:26,532 --> 00:16:28,935
me but jurassic park character was not

466
00:16:28,935 --> 00:16:30,821
declaring characters alive and could come back

467
00:16:30,821 --> 00:16:32,265
any time i'm just shooting out there

468
00:16:32,295 --> 00:16:34,815
sure yeah um but in jurassic park

469
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:36,885
that's why they made a bunch of

470
00:16:36,885 --> 00:16:38,775
the dinosaurs they made the giant dinosaurs

471
00:16:38,775 --> 00:16:40,245
yeah and then they mixed it with

472
00:16:40,245 --> 00:16:40,515
cd

473
00:16:40,515 --> 00:16:42,045
iphone yeah so so it would trick

474
00:16:42,045 --> 00:16:43,245
you it's a great blend that's why

475
00:16:43,245 --> 00:16:44,715
when you watch godzilla and kong it's

476
00:16:44,715 --> 00:16:46,545
just like alright i'm watching a cartoon

477
00:16:46,545 --> 00:16:48,825
whatever i know that's why i'm and

478
00:16:48,825 --> 00:16:50,595
i still think it's fun but i

479
00:16:50,745 --> 00:16:52,275
it's fun it doesn't i just go

480
00:16:52,275 --> 00:16:53,955
oh i'm not scared in the way

481
00:16:53,955 --> 00:16:54,975
that i wanna be like i would

482
00:16:54,975 --> 00:16:56,415
yeah more scared if i that's how

483
00:16:56,415 --> 00:16:58,185
i feel about the marvel movies is

484
00:16:58,185 --> 00:17:00,675
that the you know the big eye

485
00:17:00,915 --> 00:17:02,415
i i could be wrong but i

486
00:17:02,415 --> 00:17:03,975
feel like the big draw of those

487
00:17:03,975 --> 00:17:07,305
things is the crazy action and knowing

488
00:17:07,305 --> 00:17:09,975
that it's all just cdi i don't

489
00:17:10,035 --> 00:17:12,225
care because only doing sometimes i think

490
00:17:12,225 --> 00:17:13,845
for the marvel movies the draw isn't

491
00:17:13,845 --> 00:17:15,195
the action it's the stuff around the

492
00:17:15,195 --> 00:17:16,275
action but i know what you mean

493
00:17:16,275 --> 00:17:18,165
because if you're just looking at iron

494
00:17:18,165 --> 00:17:19,725
man flying around in it is a

495
00:17:19,725 --> 00:17:20,565
cartoon yeah

496
00:17:20,865 --> 00:17:24,225
battling spider-man that's why they consciously go

497
00:17:24,225 --> 00:17:26,085
inside iron man suit to see robert

498
00:17:26,085 --> 00:17:27,915
downey jr's head and they always have

499
00:17:27,915 --> 00:17:30,135
spiderman taking off his mask yeah because

500
00:17:30,135 --> 00:17:32,085
the human factor of it is is

501
00:17:32,085 --> 00:17:34,395
the stuff that engages audiences yeah the

502
00:17:34,785 --> 00:17:36,435
cartoon but you know if something's just

503
00:17:36,435 --> 00:17:38,265
purely a cartoon like the incredibles it's

504
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:40,185
great i love it yeah absolutely

00:17:41,475 --> 00:17:42,855

656
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:59,060
bone of contention for me that i

657
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:01,130
expressly said to the d jays

658
00:23:01,167 --> 00:23:03,050

659
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:04,790
yeah when he started playing it we

660
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,080
at that point so much had gone

661
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,090
wrong and and and yet we had

662
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:10,100
pulled off a good wedding that we

663
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:12,650
just started laughing just just just funny

664
00:23:12,650 --> 00:23:14,600
that's just the herald at that point

665
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,880
sure ah kumar

666
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:19,820

667
00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:21,860
got married the first time my rule

668
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:23,330
was they could not play brown eyed

669
00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:25,400

670
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:28,070
that to really and janie was ami

671
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:30,080

laid out it's it doesn't excel but

678
00:23:40,070 --> 00:23:41,450

00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:43,190
played out but i i got into

680
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:44,780
a van morrison kick just in time

681
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:46,100

695
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:10,700

696
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:13,490
this is a real you got rich

697
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:16,430
situation everybody's wrestling well back into the

698
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:18,860
shore um i wrestled in the pools

699
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:20,480
what i said van morrison's been with

700
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:20,960
hot oil

701
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:24,080
getting full pour out oil in there

702
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,330
it just lay on the top of

703
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:26,390
the

704
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:31,010
then put salt and pepper and boil

705
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:31,580
it huh

706
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:34,130
val morris has been a widow for

707
00:24:34,130 --> 00:24:36,440
a very long time and i have

708
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:38,090
what did he recently do he while

709
00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:39,380
he retorted that tie back

710
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:42,350
yeah i lockdown happened with eric clapton

711
00:24:43,370 --> 00:24:45,500
eric clapton claim that he didn't know

712
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:46,670
what it was about i think you

713
00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:47,810
and i were talking about this and

714
00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:49,370
i that's hilarious but it's like it's

715
00:24:49,370 --> 00:24:50,781
like a poem that he didn't understand

716
00:24:50,781 --> 00:24:51,920
i think that i said that's a

717
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:55,430
possibility to give like like air claps

718
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:57,020
in a backdoor but i'm thinking more

719
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:58,790
and more that eric clapton like lady

720
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:00,230
i can see van morrison going hey

721
00:25:00,230 --> 00:25:01,430
man you wanna play my song and

722
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:03,500
him going you'll do mr van

723
00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:05,870
morrison knit roaring solo

724
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:08,540
i'm sure i've said this before but

725
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:11,330
i always think eric clapton's american and

726
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:13,790
i'm always surprised when he's not yeah

727
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:15,440
every time you only say that every

728
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,930
time your eye due to space you've

729
00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:19,160
said it i will say it to

730
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:21,140
his face i have somewhere this this

731
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,120
album that van morrison recorded to break

732
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,950
a contract he had to tell the

733
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:27,050
record label it's like it is

734
00:25:27,089 --> 00:25:29,870
is just made up nonsense songs late

735
00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:31,220
so he wanted them to fire him

736
00:25:31,370 --> 00:25:33,440
he he he owed yeah yeah you

737
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,780

continue with the store around the complaint

785
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,330
about married at first sight is that

786
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:26,780
it's an eight week process of the

788
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:29,450
a million episodes like it's just it's

789
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:32,120
really too long okay but there's also

790
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:33,500
they're not really married at first sight

791
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:35,300
because they do see each other before

792
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,650
they're pronounced mary

793
00:27:36,650 --> 00:27:39,380

00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:56,210

00:27:56,210 --> 00:27:56,780
without seeing him

803
00:27:56,810 --> 00:27:58,400

he took her for a flight okay

816
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:25,370
and i was just wondering what you

817
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:27,200

819
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:29,900
her life and then she's like can

820
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:31,970
you do that zero gravity thing yeah

821
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:33,590
i mean it's floating around them which

822
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:34,790
i didn't know is like a thing

00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:36,890
but i didn't like it and i

824
00:28:36,890 --> 00:28:37,130

846
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,640
i was always probably wow up to

847
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:21,860
yeah um my dad was telling me

848
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:24,080
a story about either my mom or

849
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,730
someone else that he was dating or

850
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:28,490
something when he went from florida to

851
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:30,950
jamaica and he flew them from florida

852
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:31,190
to

853
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:34,310
l a how does it help florida

854
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:38,750
jamaica ooh wow i got to barbuda

855
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:42,260
blah blah he said everything was fine

856
00:29:42,290 --> 00:29:45,770
when they left they took off because

857
00:29:45,770 --> 00:29:47,390
you could turn around and see florida

858
00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:49,070
like oh wow florida is getting smaller

859
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:51,140
whatever it is until suddenly you can't

860
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:53,840
see anything other than water everywhere yeah

861
00:29:53,870 --> 00:29:55,550
no no no no the the woman

862
00:29:55,550 --> 00:29:56,840
started to freak out i think i

863
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:59,540
would panic and they'd be like no

864
00:29:59,540 --> 00:29:59,930
no it's

865
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,490
and like how do you know where

866
00:30:01,490 --> 00:30:03,800
you're going like if you're not aiming

867
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,720
at something and my dad was trying

868
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,100
to say well it's these instruments right

869
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:08,780
here they tell you where you're going

870
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:10,580
well then the woman said she goes

871
00:30:10,610 --> 00:30:12,170
is there like an autopilot thing and

872
00:30:12,170 --> 00:30:13,250
he's like nope just me and she's

873
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:14,420
like so if you pass out we're

874
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:17,270
screwed and he was like huh actually

875
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:19,130
that's the scariest realization you could possibly

876
00:30:19,130 --> 00:30:20,090
have yeah so

877
00:30:20,090 --> 00:30:21,740
why is it like doing zero gravity

878
00:30:21,770 --> 00:30:24,290
well zero gravity bullshit i don't know

879
00:30:24,290 --> 00:30:25,670
i guess he honks his head just

880
00:30:25,670 --> 00:30:27,950
thinks it looks cool ranch the official

881
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:30,710
report to listen because of the zero

882
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:33,080
gravity bullshit but i probably i've probably

883
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:34,370
mentioned this before i felt i've been

884
00:30:34,370 --> 00:30:36,170
following this mormon mommy blogger for like

885
00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:39,770
the last yes twenty years of exile

886
00:30:39,770 --> 00:30:40,250
i'm falling for

887
00:30:40,875 --> 00:30:42,735
and maybe know at least ten years

888
00:30:42,735 --> 00:30:44,025
okay it's getting shorter and shorter but

889
00:30:44,445 --> 00:30:45,645
the kids have grown up and just

890
00:30:45,645 --> 00:30:48,326
started last week it's shocking but they

891
00:30:48,437 --> 00:30:52,005
they were this perfect family this like

892
00:30:52,005 --> 00:30:54,401
sort of her blog was popular because

893
00:30:54,401 --> 00:30:56,595
every family is perfect but the blog

894
00:30:56,595 --> 00:30:57,765
was happy because they took like pretty

895
00:30:57,765 --> 00:31:00,285
pictures of their pretty family and then

896
00:31:00,345 --> 00:31:01,035
they had

897
00:31:01,035 --> 00:31:03,045
had they went on a small plane

898
00:31:03,045 --> 00:31:04,995
and they got the crash was just

899
00:31:04,995 --> 00:31:06,705
the parents and the pilot and the

900
00:31:06,705 --> 00:31:09,615
pilot died and the the they were

901
00:31:09,615 --> 00:31:12,255
burned heavily and the the man was

902
00:31:12,255 --> 00:31:13,485
burned like twenty percent of his body

903
00:31:13,485 --> 00:31:14,895
and the elemental whistle house right

904
00:31:15,945 --> 00:31:17,685

905
00:31:17,685 --> 00:31:18,645
of her body and she's spent the

906
00:31:18,645 --> 00:31:20,745
last ten years like recovering and like

00:32:42,555 --> 00:32:44,535
the fly by checking the instruments because

945
00:32:44,535 --> 00:32:45,765
they tell you everything you need to

946
00:32:45,765 --> 00:32:47,145

no but they they that's what happens

952
00:33:01,215 --> 00:33:02,925
they get disoriented they don't check the

953
00:33:02,925 --> 00:33:04,905
instruments they think they can they do

954
00:33:04,905 --> 00:33:06,045
it all by sight and then they

955
00:33:06,045 --> 00:33:08,055
end up upside down and oh no

956
00:33:08,115 --> 00:33:11,025

961
00:33:16,905 --> 00:33:17,295
but then

962
00:33:17,355 --> 00:33:19,339
they could make a cancelled because who

963
00:33:19,339 --> 00:33:21,225

964
00:33:21,225 --> 00:33:23,055

00:33:30,795 --> 00:33:33,315
who's the core for the for is

970
00:33:33,315 --> 00:33:36,255
you me paul and kula because everyone

971
00:33:36,255 --> 00:33:37,515

yeah that's what i would not want

973
00:33:39,825 --> 00:33:41,085
to do either none of us wanted

974
00:33:41,085 --> 00:33:41,745
to do it but i thought it

975
00:33:41,745 --> 00:33:44,025
was funny labeling us as the core

976
00:33:44,025 --> 00:33:47,895
for ideally yes to dinner they all

977
00:33:47,895 --> 00:33:48,615
went off to do so i was

978
00:33:48,615 --> 00:33:52,875
like oh the core for saying that

979
00:33:52,875 --> 00:33:54,195
we were the most important we were

980
00:33:54,459 --> 00:33:56,263
real yes it's like everyone else is

981
00:33:56,263 --> 00:33:57,315
sort of extraneous

982
00:33:57,705 --> 00:34:00,435
with with a real meanwhile they're going

983
00:34:00,435 --> 00:34:02,745
off having like an actual adventure anyway

984
00:34:02,745 --> 00:34:03,885

985
00:34:03,885 --> 00:34:06,405
to have dinner there communing with wild

986
00:34:06,405 --> 00:34:08,835
sea creatures and having like an amazing

987
00:34:08,865 --> 00:34:10,964
experience or they're like luminescent fish or

988
00:34:10,964 --> 00:34:11,745
whatever the fuck

989
00:34:12,825 --> 00:34:13,815
i didn't not want to do that

990
00:34:13,815 --> 00:34:15,705
i don't why i that's that's a

991
00:34:15,705 --> 00:34:17,595
final frontier for me i can't handle

992
00:34:17,595 --> 00:34:19,695
that like sea life is very it's

993
00:34:19,695 --> 00:34:22,845
kind of gives me an ah very

994
00:34:22,845 --> 00:34:24,645
scared feeling i used to like to

995
00:34:24,645 --> 00:34:27,525

996
00:34:27,615 --> 00:34:28,755
like if i ever when i went

it

1000
00:34:32,985 --> 00:34:34,035
it was like you'd find all these

1001
00:34:34,035 --> 00:34:36,255
places where there'd be so many fish

1002
00:34:36,255 --> 00:34:38,235
and it was and it didn't feel

1003
00:34:38,265 --> 00:34:40,485
unsafe or although i will say at

1004
00:34:40,485 --> 00:34:42,555

make myself do it what if it

1111
00:37:59,115 --> 00:38:00,855

story i don't even know if that's

1113
00:38:02,085 --> 00:38:03,615
what i was afraid of today even

1114
00:38:03,615 --> 00:38:04,965
bite what if you didn't like it's

1115
00:38:04,965 --> 00:38:05,475
texture

1116
00:38:07,365 --> 00:38:09,135
you know this is what i was

1117
00:38:09,135 --> 00:38:10,275
just talking to my friend do like

1118
00:38:10,275 --> 00:38:11,985
chinese texture you like i love her

1119
00:38:11,985 --> 00:38:13,995
texture she has her vows

1120
00:38:15,345 --> 00:38:18,495
that texture that thing where you hate

1121
00:38:18,585 --> 00:38:21,165
love three holes you hate when yeah

1122
00:38:21,165 --> 00:38:23,115
that's true trip to phobia i think

1123
00:38:23,175 --> 00:38:24,705
yes my friend has this and i

1124
00:38:24,705 --> 00:38:26,775
was like really many times she has

1125
00:38:26,775 --> 00:38:29,535
three holes she never was definitely both

1126
00:38:29,715 --> 00:38:31,485
i've never heard of testicles but she's

1127
00:38:31,485 --> 00:38:32,835
terribly feel like i've talked about this

1128
00:38:32,835 --> 00:38:35,265
on a different show it's it's ah

1129
00:38:35,415 --> 00:38:36,315
what do you call it not a

1130
00:38:36,375 --> 00:38:38,021
disorder it's just it's ah yeah so

1131
00:38:38,021 --> 00:38:39,165
it's just something like it'll be ah

1132
00:38:39,255 --> 00:38:40,845
you know how there there were certain

1133
00:38:40,845 --> 00:38:43,695
phones that came out camera three different

1134
00:38:43,695 --> 00:38:45,615
i have it i have it yeah

1135
00:38:45,645 --> 00:38:47,025
some people really flipped out about this

1136
00:38:47,025 --> 00:38:48,945
because it was like her activating my

1137
00:38:48,945 --> 00:38:50,625
trip to fail so it's it's basically

1138
00:38:50,625 --> 00:38:54,645
like people feel weirded out by cities

1139
00:38:54,645 --> 00:38:55,515
that have three

1140
00:38:55,545 --> 00:38:57,285
holes in the ground shakes each other

1141
00:38:57,315 --> 00:39:00,195
but she also said it's like certain

1142
00:39:00,285 --> 00:39:02,685
textures will make her feel like crazy

1143
00:39:03,045 --> 00:39:05,025
like if there's like a bumpy lizard

1144
00:39:05,025 --> 00:39:06,645
or like you know just things that

1145
00:39:06,645 --> 00:39:07,695
she's like and i was like what

1146
00:39:07,695 --> 00:39:09,015
does it feel like you're scared and

1147
00:39:09,015 --> 00:39:10,125
she was like no i just like

1148
00:39:10,215 --> 00:39:12,075
really i feel really grossed out like

1149
00:39:12,075 --> 00:39:14,385
i really like mediation we feel like

1150
00:39:14,385 --> 00:39:15,675
that about nails on the chalk

1151
00:39:15,675 --> 00:39:17,895
gboard so it's not that strange it's

1152
00:39:17,895 --> 00:39:20,025
just interesting to look at something and

1153
00:39:20,025 --> 00:39:21,945
b have like such a visceral reaction

1154
00:39:21,945 --> 00:39:23,265

so in case that wasn't clear

1157
00:39:31,065 --> 00:39:32,715
um but anyway this sounds really interesting

1158
00:39:32,715 --> 00:39:34,351
cause i never knew anyone to happen

1159
00:39:34,395 --> 00:39:36,585

no other colors there are no other

1206
00:41:17,105 --> 00:41:18,785

1219
00:41:44,435 --> 00:41:46,265
says it is a race idea that

1220
00:41:46,265 --> 00:41:48,665

some guy in my neighborhood the sound

1332
00:46:06,785 --> 00:46:09,515
is carrying so well he was practicing

1333
00:46:09,515 --> 00:46:12,305
his band with the chili peppers it

1334
00:46:12,305 --> 00:46:14,495
was my neighbour certainly was not and

1335
00:46:14,495 --> 00:46:17,825
he was practicing his song and so

1336
00:46:17,825 --> 00:46:19,175
then mike started like making fun of

1337
00:46:19,175 --> 00:46:20,135
him and i was like sure if

1338
00:46:20,135 --> 00:46:20,885
he could hear you and he's like

1339
00:46:21,125 --> 00:46:22,115
he can't hear us

1340
00:46:22,325 --> 00:46:24,395
we were hearing him singing his whole

1341
00:46:24,395 --> 00:46:25,925
song if he could hear asthma but

1342
00:46:25,925 --> 00:46:27,238
then how do we hear him i

1343
00:46:27,238 --> 00:46:28,865
gotta understand yeah i don't understand how

1344
00:46:28,865 --> 00:46:30,335
the noise is caring but he was

1345
00:46:30,335 --> 00:46:31,715
so he sound like he was auditioning

1346
00:46:31,715 --> 00:46:35,375
to be in guster industrial it was

1347
00:46:35,375 --> 00:46:36,965
just really usually the way it works

1348
00:46:36,965 --> 00:46:38,795
is like something that's louder than another

1349
00:46:38,795 --> 00:46:42,455
thing is more audible okay but i

1350
00:46:42,485 --> 00:46:44,225
still felt like usually the way i

1351
00:46:44,225 --> 00:46:46,355
still felt like i could hear him

1352
00:46:46,355 --> 00:46:48,245
so clearly that if we were also

1353
00:46:48,245 --> 00:46:50,165
yelling back making fun of him he

1354
00:46:50,165 --> 00:46:52,715
could yes probably unless he was making

1355
00:46:52,745 --> 00:46:54,425
currently making noise well i thought it

1356
00:46:54,425 --> 00:46:57,065
had just stopped and then he actually

1357
00:46:57,065 --> 00:46:58,925
was in fact continuing but i was

1358
00:46:58,925 --> 00:47:00,425
like with the balls you have to

1359
00:47:00,425 --> 00:47:02,615
have your windows open practicing

1360
00:47:02,645 --> 00:47:06,155
this song goes one two three

1361
00:47:07,055 --> 00:47:08,525
oh no boo yeah and then i

1362
00:47:08,525 --> 00:47:10,505
was like oh no you're alone you

1363
00:47:10,505 --> 00:47:12,185

1364
00:47:12,185 --> 00:47:15,905
me ah i think about my neighbors

1365
00:47:15,905 --> 00:47:17,075
what they must hear from me all

1366
00:47:17,075 --> 00:47:19,415

00:49:43,145 --> 00:49:45,095
an entirely different noise if i'm hurt

1437
00:49:45,365 --> 00:49:46,745
that all people whine like a little

1438
00:49:46,745 --> 00:49:48,005
but i feel like i was slightly

1439
00:49:48,005 --> 00:49:49,145
know if i'm hurt i was like

1440
00:49:49,535 --> 00:49:51,635
why don't we just do this later

1441
00:49:51,665 --> 00:49:52,265
you know like

1442
00:49:52,295 --> 00:49:53,560
cause he was like tired i'm like

1443
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:55,203
close to a slater doesn't matter and

1444
00:49:55,203 --> 00:49:57,515
music i wanna fucking you know it's

1445
00:49:57,515 --> 00:49:58,985
like he wants to finish it yeah

1446
00:49:59,045 --> 00:50:00,155
and it was like it's just like

1447
00:50:00,155 --> 00:50:01,805
this annoying little thing and i'm being

1448
00:50:01,805 --> 00:50:03,425
more annoying when i think i'm really

1449
00:50:03,425 --> 00:50:07,055
de-escalating like i'm like yeah sometimes de-escalating

1450
00:50:07,055 --> 00:50:09,425
is escalating yeah i'm learning that funny

1451
00:50:09,425 --> 00:50:10,805
like in the vietnam war that your

1452
00:50:10,805 --> 00:50:12,455
father probably sure of course

1453
00:50:12,905 --> 00:50:16,985
one pale make you be me but

1454
00:50:17,405 --> 00:50:19,535
one makes you hungry for ems

1455
00:50:20,615 --> 00:50:26,555
yeah i think i say i probably

1456
00:50:26,555 --> 00:50:29,135
say god dammit or jesus no i

1457
00:50:29,135 --> 00:50:31,055
probably said jesus fucking christ like i

1458
00:50:31,055 --> 00:50:33,755
say non-elite probably was cool up to

1459
00:50:33,755 --> 00:50:36,755
it because co-op is very expressive when

1460
00:50:36,755 --> 00:50:38,465
she's upset do you try to help

1461
00:50:38,465 --> 00:50:40,715
