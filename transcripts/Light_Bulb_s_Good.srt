my day was hijacked by something else

00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:15,210
now it had nothing to do with

56
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:15,360
me

57
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,550
me and now i am suffering for

58
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:19,920
it which always makes me mad when

59
00:02:19,955 --> 00:02:21,210
you have to go move a couch

60
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,610

right before the show i yeah i

63
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:30,720
had an entire pizza a six pack

64
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,110
of beer and i'm tired i understand

65
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:37,080
god what how old were you the

66
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,880
last time a friend made you help

67
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:42,480
them move wow it doesn't happen to

68
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:44,345
girls as much i went on my

69
00:02:44,345 --> 00:02:44,850
way then

70
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,410
should a guess because i i but

71
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:48,180
i have made a lot of guy

72
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:50,430
friends helped me move many times over

73
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:52,710
the years but it's been i haven't

74
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:55,980
made someone do that in probably four

75
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:58,350
years someone said no no more than

76
00:02:58,350 --> 00:02:59,910
that five years if you're in your

77
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:03,000
thirties you should just hire movers yeah

78
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,140
i think when i turn thirty that's

79
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:05,040
the first time i hired me

80
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,860
rvers i mean that's when you gotta

81
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:09,000
you told that to me you got

82
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,260
to a point where you realize it's

83
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:13,470
worth spending the money because it's not

84
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:16,740
look probably unless you know i'm moving

85
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:18,120
a mansion to a mansion like if

86
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,250
you're just moving apartments yeah you know

87
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:22,140
and it's it's not it is more

88
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:23,280
money than you would like to spend

89
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,170
but it's not a prohibitive

90
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,960
amount of money necessarily can i say

91
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:29,250

out right here i was so upset

207
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:31,140
i was choose a particular person we

208
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:32,790
did not have a great relationship lasted

209
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:35,850
for one year um and i fed

210
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:37,950
the way i touched on this actually

211
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:38,640
in a pr

212
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,860
previous episode we were talking about previously

213
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:43,770
on through perusal we were talking about

214
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:45,600
people dying and and the feelings that

215
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,610
you have and how strange it is

216
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:49,800
when someone from your life in some

217
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,330
capacity passes away and you realize you

218
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:53,790
don't have a strong feeling about it

219
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:56,550
and how that feels so weird and

220
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:58,800
monstrous but ah it

221
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:00,630
but the that does happen sometimes in

222
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:02,160
your life depending on the people that

223
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,900
are in your life but that's um

224
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,750
she yeah she ah anyone dies i

225
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,370
feel bad about it and even people

226
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:10,200
i don't know anyone dies i feel

227
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:12,780
good about it all day i'm crying

228
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:14,040
because somebody dies

229
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:16,500
is that what a dieta stands for

230
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,630
yeah

231
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,450
all day i dream about somebody don't

232
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:23,040
you just ah

233
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:25,860
but yeah it was she so we

234
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:27,060
have been broken up for a long

235
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:30,360
time and then ah so many are

236
00:08:30,371 --> 00:08:31,470
talent superseded that

237
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:35,430
no no are we still talking about

238
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:37,740
the stephanie miller show were oh we

239
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:39,150
really wanna go back to that yeah

240
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,680
i think that's why i thought you

241
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,240
were talking about she's lucky that part

242
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,920
she got me though she suggested me

243
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,750
and i was approved the the producer

244
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:50,850
at the time was ah a legendary

245
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,560
ah comedy writer who had worked on

246
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:52,800
the array

247
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,550
original snell and i remember the first

248
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:58,170
thing that i was supposed to do

249
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,410
was a richard nixon impression and then

250
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:03,000
put me in full mix and makeup

251
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,280
and everything um well there was some

252
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,600
story that just had just come out

253
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,490
about him that had been released or

254
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:11,550
whatever and so um the sketch was

255
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:12,930
very dark suggesting that

256
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,970
richard nixon was actually going to assassinate

257
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:16,830
j f k but the lee harvey

258
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:17,580
oswald beat him to it

259
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:20,760
so as me and nixon you know

260
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,250
actually oh i want yasmin i started

261
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:25,200
listening to last podcast on the left

262
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,210
episodes about the j f k conspiracy

263
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:28,620
oh okay what do you think oh

264
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:31,020
that you can eat well what's crazy

265
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:32,850
is that there's like six episodes and

266
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:34,260
the first two don't even get into

267
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:35,820
it so i honestly have no opinions

268
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:36,540
yet okay

269
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:39,300
yeah let us know when you become

270
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,400
a j f k weirdo conspiracy nut

271
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,870
yeah but it was funny cause mike

272
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:44,340
was like oh let's listen to that

273
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:45,781
let's listen last podcast on the left

274
00:09:45,781 --> 00:09:46,860
and that's okay annie's like you enlist

275
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:48,120
a gf campuses and i was like

276
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,650
sure did you hear me talking about

277
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:50,790
that and you know and i was

278
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,230
like i just said i don't know

279
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:53,910
anything about that so just a weird

280
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:56,460
country so already the conspiracy seems to

281
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:57,390
be a foot

282
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:01,710
but anyway what so anyway what is

283
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:03,330
that the title of this episode so

284
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:05,220
when i'm away would when i was

285
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:08,550
brought up to um ah perhaps play

286
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:11,910
this role this richard dixon part ah

287
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:13,860
this producer called me on the phone

288
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:17,610
and made me do the impression for

289
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:17,970
her

290
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:21,025
yeah and it was horrible it was

291
00:10:21,025 --> 00:10:22,285
really horrible it was like i did

292
00:10:22,285 --> 00:10:25,885
not expect that to happen um and

293
00:10:25,915 --> 00:10:28,045
i did the impression and she's her

294
00:10:28,135 --> 00:10:30,505
immediately review was that's a pretty good

295
00:10:30,535 --> 00:10:33,595
homemade nixon impression but my word like

296
00:10:33,595 --> 00:10:34,945
it's not as good we're looking for

297
00:10:34,945 --> 00:10:37,135
more of like a danny ackroyd nixon

298
00:10:37,135 --> 00:10:38,785
oppression like something really good

299
00:10:38,785 --> 00:10:40,525
good and so i said i'll work

300
00:10:40,525 --> 00:10:41,965
on it i'll work on it and

301
00:10:41,965 --> 00:10:43,375
i was so incense so i was

302
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:44,845
like who can't do a nixon impression

303
00:10:45,265 --> 00:10:47,365
and then when i finally saw the

304
00:10:47,365 --> 00:10:49,615
sketch after it was done i realised

305
00:10:49,645 --> 00:10:51,020
i can't imagine

306
00:10:52,225 --> 00:10:53,246
i did not do a good nixon

307
00:10:53,246 --> 00:10:54,865
in french soccer to be

308
00:10:56,245 --> 00:11:00,055
ah um and ah yes so that

309
00:11:00,055 --> 00:11:03,145
so ah that was that experience then

310
00:11:03,925 --> 00:11:05,155
but that was the experience where i

311
00:11:05,155 --> 00:11:06,745
got to have a life mask i

312
00:11:06,745 --> 00:11:08,395
had to because they they put prosthetics

313
00:11:08,395 --> 00:11:10,345
on me and so they poured the

314
00:11:10,345 --> 00:11:11,935
goop all over my face and i

315
00:11:11,935 --> 00:11:14,035
was in isolation for you know a

316
00:11:14,035 --> 00:11:16,135
couple hours um i signed

317
00:11:16,525 --> 00:11:18,115
and i really enjoyed you did you

318
00:11:18,115 --> 00:11:19,945
like how it felt when you had

319
00:11:19,945 --> 00:11:22,315
it on i did i really cool

320
00:11:22,345 --> 00:11:24,115
because i've never done that it blacked

321
00:11:24,115 --> 00:11:25,465
out everything around you and you could

322
00:11:25,465 --> 00:11:26,455
yeah be alone with you it was

323
00:11:26,455 --> 00:11:28,255
a sensory deprivation thing like what i

324
00:11:28,255 --> 00:11:29,965
mean like when it was done did

325
00:11:29,965 --> 00:11:31,525
you like be having the face on

326
00:11:33,205 --> 00:11:35,125
face no i did not because it

327
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:38,665
was still that stuff was still i

328
00:11:38,665 --> 00:11:40,855
mean ah it's come such a long

329
00:11:40,855 --> 00:11:42,445
way but it was like kind of

330
00:11:42,445 --> 00:11:44,275
like you can't ah

331
00:11:44,815 --> 00:11:46,735

mouth that much you know you can't

333
00:11:48,235 --> 00:11:49,495
like wow you know you had to

334
00:11:49,495 --> 00:11:50,455
be very careful and they had to

335
00:11:50,455 --> 00:11:52,915
do constant touch-ups around any moving part

336
00:11:52,915 --> 00:11:55,375
of your face um but yeah i

337
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:56,395
said you liked it when it was

338
00:11:56,395 --> 00:11:57,775

339
00:11:57,775 --> 00:12:00,325
experience you like having a stay still

340
00:12:00,325 --> 00:12:00,835

00:13:11,965 --> 00:13:12,865
hold hands

374
00:13:14,425 --> 00:13:14,635
yeah

375
00:13:16,015 --> 00:13:17,073
you don't have to hold your breath

376
00:13:17,995 --> 00:13:19,825
though you do you do here it's

377
00:13:19,825 --> 00:13:21,925
very minimal amount of water i think

378
00:13:21,925 --> 00:13:23,665
i know really well you're floating in

379
00:13:23,665 --> 00:13:25,585
it and then there's like an egg

380
00:13:25,585 --> 00:13:28,345
capsule over the top oh okay so

381
00:13:28,345 --> 00:13:30,295
your food star didn't give you something

382
00:13:30,295 --> 00:13:32,306
to float on are you exposed to

383
00:13:32,331 --> 00:13:34,195
water i think so you naturally flow

384
00:13:34,345 --> 00:13:35,905
yes interesting maybe

385
00:13:35,937 --> 00:13:37,315
like you have a raft in there

386
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:41,365
yeah a couple men it's the size

387
00:13:41,365 --> 00:13:44,425
of a college it's very small it's

388
00:13:44,425 --> 00:13:45,655
the size of your body it's the

389
00:13:45,655 --> 00:13:46,735
size of a coffin but not as

390
00:13:46,735 --> 00:13:47,905
nice i hope it's not the exact

391
00:13:47,905 --> 00:13:49,045
size of my body because i'll never

392
00:13:49,045 --> 00:13:50,365
fit it should be a little bigger

393
00:13:50,425 --> 00:13:53,125
it's it's executive scott's body they they

394
00:13:53,155 --> 00:13:54,805

00:14:56,695 --> 00:15:00,115
he has got actually sleep weird um

428
00:15:00,144 --> 00:15:01,795
i have i may have sleep apnea

429
00:15:01,795 --> 00:15:03,295
because i have breathing issues in the

430
00:15:03,295 --> 00:15:07,405
night in the nae nae breathing issues

431
00:15:07,405 --> 00:15:10,945
in the night this ex um wow

433
00:15:13,135 --> 00:15:14,125
out if you need to have a

434
00:15:14,305 --> 00:15:16,465
machine yeah gotta see if i need

435
00:15:16,465 --> 00:15:18,805
a micro machine and um i think

436
00:15:18,805 --> 00:15:20,005
it's like you swallow it and then

437
00:15:20,005 --> 00:15:21,625
it makes you breathe better yeah you

438
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:22,705
talk really fast yeah

439
00:15:25,465 --> 00:15:26,995
so i have to go i mean

440
00:15:26,995 --> 00:15:29,215
there were two options ah there's one

441
00:15:29,215 --> 00:15:30,445
that i could do at home which

442
00:15:30,445 --> 00:15:31,795
is like they put a house arrest

443
00:15:31,825 --> 00:15:34,135
bracelet on or something and then but

444
00:15:34,135 --> 00:15:37,945
it won't necessarily it it it's not

445
00:15:37,945 --> 00:15:40,375
guaranteed to find an apnea if you

446
00:15:40,375 --> 00:15:42,415
have one feels like they really need

447
00:15:42,415 --> 00:15:44,065
to see you were yes

448
00:15:44,185 --> 00:15:46,825
the in-clinic one you definitely watch you

449
00:15:46,825 --> 00:15:49,255
the whole time and make notes or

450
00:15:49,285 --> 00:15:51,025
they videotape it at least or something

451
00:15:51,415 --> 00:15:52,825
i i think they just i don't

452
00:15:52,825 --> 00:15:54,445
know if anyone's like watching me for

453
00:15:54,445 --> 00:15:56,425
eight hours overnight always assume that there

454
00:15:56,425 --> 00:15:57,955
was someone sitting there in a window

455
00:15:57,955 --> 00:15:59,995
watching you i'm not kidding i really

456
00:16:00,055 --> 00:16:01,135
thought it was like i think of

457
00:16:01,285 --> 00:16:03,175
study you know right like i sit

458
00:16:03,175 --> 00:16:04,225
there i guess

459
00:16:04,405 --> 00:16:06,745
scratch your butt they go huh guys

460
00:16:06,775 --> 00:16:10,045
a little alan partridge reference um i

461
00:16:10,045 --> 00:16:12,775
assume that they just record it and

462
00:16:12,775 --> 00:16:15,085
then watch it later rather than whoring

463
00:16:15,115 --> 00:16:16,615
why not do it weird ate real

464
00:16:16,615 --> 00:16:18,565
time wed so they can with bill

465
00:16:18,565 --> 00:16:21,325
maher parts yeah exactly do we have

466
00:16:21,325 --> 00:16:23,365
the best forty like boring boring boring

467
00:16:23,395 --> 00:16:24,085
oh he's choking

468
00:16:25,495 --> 00:16:26,305
oh and he's dead

469
00:16:28,585 --> 00:16:29,845

00:16:29,845 --> 00:16:32,005
out maybe they lie to you like

471
00:16:32,005 --> 00:16:33,355

then they go home well i mean

473
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:36,625
i think one thing just lead to

474
00:16:36,925 --> 00:16:38,185
it's hard to think well no but

475
00:16:38,185 --> 00:16:39,925
maybe on a nightshift but it's weird

476
00:16:39,925 --> 00:16:41,215
to think like going to sleep sounds

477
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:44,545
coming down yeah if you were getting

478
00:16:44,545 --> 00:16:46,315
the study done i think i might

479
00:16:46,315 --> 00:16:47,155
feel i can be

480
00:16:47,215 --> 00:16:48,655
harder to fall asleep thinking that there's

481
00:16:48,685 --> 00:16:50,095
you know three men watching me through

482
00:16:50,095 --> 00:16:52,645

yeah it was this

524
00:18:14,785 --> 00:18:17,275
yep ghost and then they saw the

525
00:18:17,275 --> 00:18:20,065

gay couple who were like a we

533
00:18:32,995 --> 00:18:33,505
don't care

534
00:18:36,985 --> 00:18:39,895
we emily here i think some people

535
00:18:39,895 --> 00:18:42,415
are the idea of a child saying

536
00:18:42,445 --> 00:18:43,927
i was just talking to so and

537
00:18:43,927 --> 00:18:45,595
so that's that's they check oh that

538
00:18:45,595 --> 00:18:46,765
was part of they checked with the

539
00:18:46,765 --> 00:18:48,325
previous owner and they're like that's a

540
00:18:48,325 --> 00:18:50,005
person who doesn't yeah no that's the

541
00:18:50,005 --> 00:18:51,175
person who died in the house no

542
00:18:51,175 --> 00:18:52,525
no no no no did i not

543
00:18:52,525 --> 00:18:54,505
tell you that no no no no

544
00:18:54,505 --> 00:18:54,865
no but

545
00:18:54,895 --> 00:18:56,755
then people saying go start really i

546
00:18:56,755 --> 00:18:58,225
have a hard time with that because

547
00:18:58,285 --> 00:19:01,015
i'm like you if there's enough stories

548
00:19:01,015 --> 00:19:02,905
of of someone who has no idea

549
00:19:03,625 --> 00:19:05,335
having an experience and then being like

550
00:19:05,335 --> 00:19:06,265
this is the name or this is

551
00:19:06,265 --> 00:19:07,045
what was said and then there's a

552
00:19:07,045 --> 00:19:09,865
factual thing connected to that that's you

553
00:19:09,865 --> 00:19:11,815
can't really argue with that i can

554
00:19:12,535 --> 00:19:15,025
okay yeah i think that

555
00:19:15,025 --> 00:19:16,345
if you're going in a new place

556
00:19:16,345 --> 00:19:18,205
the idea of ghosts is a thing

557
00:19:18,205 --> 00:19:20,455
that we all know and i think

558
00:19:20,455 --> 00:19:22,045
you do wonder about those things when

559
00:19:22,045 --> 00:19:23,335

tv so she has you know some

583
00:20:17,815 --> 00:20:19,315
sort of connection to the television but

584
00:20:19,315 --> 00:20:21,655
you can see in mirrors yeah she

585
00:20:21,715 --> 00:20:24,205
she seems to recognize herself and she

586
00:20:24,235 --> 00:20:25,555
sometimes you can see her hair need

587
00:20:25,555 --> 00:20:27,175
some fresh and we have we talked

588
00:20:27,175 --> 00:20:28,315

590
00:20:29,435 --> 00:20:31,775
oh some dogs can't see in mirrors

591
00:20:31,775 --> 00:20:33,365
yeah it's just it looks like a

592
00:20:33,365 --> 00:20:37,145
wall no no that's impossible i thought

593
00:20:37,175 --> 00:20:38,375
let's hope there was a factual thing

594
00:20:38,375 --> 00:20:40,685
of like dogs see their reflection not

595
00:20:40,685 --> 00:20:42,275

596
00:20:42,305 --> 00:20:44,225

not friends but from what i've heard

601
00:20:52,235 --> 00:20:53,855
some dogs are able to see their

602
00:20:53,855 --> 00:20:55,145
reflection in the mirror and they wonder

603
00:20:55,145 --> 00:20:56,795
what it is and then some just

604
00:20:56,795 --> 00:20:57,995
see it as a blank wall or

605
00:20:57,995 --> 00:20:59,645
whatever well i mean she stares at

606
00:20:59,645 --> 00:21:01,235

701
00:24:18,965 --> 00:24:20,015

time because that's writing right yeah my

861
00:29:36,635 --> 00:29:39,425
mom i think was ah she married

862
00:29:39,425 --> 00:29:41,525

00:29:48,725 --> 00:29:50,375
to hear what app pawns but yes

867
00:29:50,375 --> 00:29:52,505
but but my mom married my dad

868
00:29:52,535 --> 00:29:54,005
and yeah that's where i had no

869
00:29:54,005 --> 00:29:56,315
idea how to be a housewife and

870
00:29:56,315 --> 00:29:59,795
her grandmother or or aunt or someone

871
00:29:59,795 --> 00:30:02,585

00:30:02,585 --> 00:30:05,045
she just was like in over her

873
00:30:05,045 --> 00:30:07,775
head and looked through it and looked

00:30:07,805 --> 00:30:09,395
at certain recipes that she's like i

875
00:30:09,395 --> 00:30:11,705

876
00:30:11,705 --> 00:30:13,055
don't know what hatch told us this

877
00:30:13,055 --> 00:30:14,405

880
00:30:17,748 --> 00:30:18,658
she made those over and over again

881
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:19,985

882
00:30:19,985 --> 00:30:22,715

okay good and then they can pick

893
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,640
one app for themselves but as they

894
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,740
switch partners into three-team phone they can

895
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:50,240

three options which will give you goods

897
00:30:52,244 --> 00:30:54,140

00:33:44,930 --> 00:33:47,750
how his parents got married was a

980
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:51,260
lie i know right i know it's

981
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:53,570
parents and they're still not married they're

982
00:33:53,570 --> 00:33:54,950

like we we as humans we can

1188
00:41:17,585 --> 00:41:19,385

1194
00:41:28,955 --> 00:41:30,905
than it does now and then they're

1195
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:31,955

1197
00:41:32,945 --> 00:41:34,265

00:41:54,815 --> 00:41:55,895
then i'll go ahead and get one

1209
00:41:56,075 --> 00:41:58,535
and he it ended up like three

1210
00:41:58,535 --> 00:41:59,645

1293
00:44:35,285 --> 00:44:37,745
um remember how by the way there

1294
00:44:37,745 --> 00:44:40,265
an article came out recently vulture maybe

1295
00:44:40,265 --> 00:44:42,455
about the the start of the alternative

1296
00:44:42,455 --> 00:44:45,125
comedy scene which i thought neither you

1297
00:44:45,125 --> 00:44:46,745
or i paul were mentioned because it

1298
00:44:46,745 --> 00:44:49,295
was like two years before ryan got

1299
00:44:49,295 --> 00:44:51,125
there right before i got there something

1300
00:44:51,125 --> 00:44:52,625
like that but i thought it was

1301
00:44:52,655 --> 00:44:55,265
it just made me remember all these

1302
00:44:55,265 --> 00:44:55,415
things

1303
00:44:55,415 --> 00:44:59,465
sounds about like how we because we

1304
00:44:59,525 --> 00:45:01,715
we could only communicate about where we

1305
00:45:01,715 --> 00:45:03,905
were all hanging out that night via

1306
00:45:03,905 --> 00:45:07,175
phone we all had to somehow have

1307
00:45:07,175 --> 00:45:09,755
a big long game of telephone where

1308
00:45:09,785 --> 00:45:11,135
you had to be home at some

1309
00:45:11,135 --> 00:45:13,325
point during the day and around when

1310
00:45:13,325 --> 00:45:15,335
someone would call you in order to

1311
00:45:15,335 --> 00:45:15,575
get the

1312
00:45:15,575 --> 00:45:17,255
the automation of but i mean answering

1313
00:45:17,255 --> 00:45:18,065
machines existed

1314
00:45:20,195 --> 00:45:21,635
you don't have to you didn't know

1315
00:45:21,875 --> 00:45:24,785

no yeah yes

1317
00:45:27,725 --> 00:45:29,285

1318
00:45:29,285 --> 00:45:31,145
to like it leave your job to

1319
00:45:31,175 --> 00:45:33,365

00:47:06,725 --> 00:47:08,075
we were using that for a bit

1371
00:47:08,165 --> 00:47:10,325

1372
00:47:10,325 --> 00:47:11,465
was doing with a couple other people

1373
00:47:11,465 --> 00:47:12,155

1375
00:47:13,295 --> 00:47:14,855

1376
00:47:14,855 --> 00:47:16,085
like i get marco polo from ken

1380
00:47:21,785 --> 00:47:23,165
i got a few portables for people

1381
00:47:23,165 --> 00:47:25,415

1382
00:47:25,415 --> 00:47:26,885
they're just in my contacts or i'm

00:47:26,885 --> 00:47:27,815
in theirs or whatever

1384
00:47:28,355 --> 00:47:29,795
and it's like oh okay is this

1385
00:47:30,005 --> 00:47:32,075
i felt like instant pressure like oh

1386
00:47:32,075 --> 00:47:34,115
no is this like a social networking

1387
00:47:34,115 --> 00:47:36,177
app where people are just you who

1388
00:47:36,177 --> 00:47:38,375
had to respond yes people are just

1389
00:47:38,375 --> 00:47:39,845
doing it out to the void whole

1390
00:47:39,845 --> 00:47:42,875
day yeah it was the i think

1391
00:47:42,875 --> 00:47:43,865
that app kind of felt like a

1392
00:47:43,865 --> 00:47:45,035
lot of pressure at a certain point

1393
00:47:45,035 --> 00:47:46,415
especially when i say we're getting to

1394
00:47:46,415 --> 00:47:48,420
know i never received a

1395
00:47:48,455 --> 00:47:49,655
marco polo i have no idea what

1396
00:47:49,655 --> 00:47:51,095
you're talking about so you got oh

1397
00:47:51,110 --> 00:47:53,405
so it's an app what did you

1398
00:47:53,405 --> 00:47:55,745
sign up now well then that's why

1399
00:47:55,745 --> 00:47:57,845
you never got one oh ok it's

1400
00:47:58,115 --> 00:48:00,425
close to you i thought i thought

1401
00:48:00,425 --> 00:48:02,615
it was like linkedin requests where luno

1402
00:48:02,615 --> 00:48:05,165
is basically markopolos so yeah premise is

1403
00:48:05,195 --> 00:48:07,145
like the game marco polo where one

1404
00:48:07,145 --> 00:48:08,615
person says mark when the person's polo

1405
00:48:08,945 --> 00:48:10,475
you send a little short video that

1406
00:48:10,475 --> 00:48:11,768
person responds to the videos and they

1407
00:48:11,768 --> 00:48:14,645
just don't the guy dude it's a

1408
00:48:14,675 --> 00:48:17,765
great guy he's just short videos back

1409
00:48:17,765 --> 00:48:19,115
and forth but it's kinda it was

1410
00:48:19,145 --> 00:48:21,395
really fun for a second but for

1411
00:48:21,395 --> 00:48:24,065
a second it's like remember to periscope

1412
00:48:24,725 --> 00:48:26,495

1518
00:52:35,900 --> 00:52:38,990

1519
00:52:38,990 --> 00:52:41,360
news that that texas but i'm the

1520
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:43,550
banana and wrote the word you and

00:52:43,550 --> 00:52:44,960

1523
00:52:46,670 --> 00:52:47,930
okay why don't you show me your

1524
00:52:47,930 --> 00:52:49,520
phones and then i'll make my decision

1525
00:52:49,850 --> 00:52:52,100
unfortunately we don't have our three-time phones

1526
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:53,360
yet so we can't show you the

1527
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:55,100
phones but you did text each other

1528
00:52:55,340 --> 00:52:56,810
and then you promptly disposed of your

1529
00:52:56,810 --> 00:52:59,540
current phones we use them away because

1530
00:52:59,540 --> 00:53:00,650
we know we wouldn't need them anymore

1531
00:53:01,040 --> 00:53:02,750
personally if all you want to ask

1532
00:53:02,750 --> 00:53:04,130
any questions to kind of get down

1533
00:53:04,130 --> 00:53:06,440
to business with yes yes yes yes

1534
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:10,430

1535
00:53:10,430 --> 00:53:12,320
what do you like best to be

1536
00:53:12,350 --> 00:53:16,100
yellow green or brown look i love

1537
00:53:16,220 --> 00:53:19,400
being brown because i know you know

1538
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:21,500
then my my life is almost over

1539
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:22,640
i know i'm either going to be

1540
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:24,140
eaten or thrown in the trash at

1541
00:53:24,140 --> 00:53:25,490
that at that point so i love

1542
00:53:25,490 --> 00:53:26,600
being brown i'm up at dan

1543
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:26,900
anna

1544
00:53:28,070 --> 00:53:29,720
i love being yellow because that's when

1545
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:32,180
i'm at my peak and people all

1546
00:53:32,180 --> 00:53:33,620
want to pick me when i'm yellow

1547
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:35,030
which is what i am right now

1548
00:53:35,030 --> 00:53:36,110
which is why you should pick me

1549
00:53:36,620 --> 00:53:38,210
the answer was green butler and was

1550
00:53:38,210 --> 00:53:41,090
closest alright second question i would all

1551
00:53:41,155 --> 00:53:43,910
be green that's for me to know

1552
00:53:43,910 --> 00:53:45,290
and for the banana to find item

1553
00:53:45,294 --> 00:53:46,700
equipment maybe he's the banana

1554
00:53:48,770 --> 00:53:54,050
second banana question banana split what goes

1555
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:57,770
on top and what goes on bottom

1556
00:53:58,190 --> 00:53:59,990
like the maraschino cherry is at the

1557
00:53:59,990 --> 00:54:03,020
very peak of a banana split and

1558
00:54:03,020 --> 00:54:05,330
at the bottom there is a layer

1559
00:54:05,330 --> 00:54:07,610
of chocolate syrup and glue and melted

1560
00:54:07,610 --> 00:54:07,820
ice

1561
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:11,540
cream banana lord now the way i've

1562
00:54:11,540 --> 00:54:12,950
been asked what it works is there

1563
00:54:12,950 --> 00:54:14,750
is a layer at the bottom of

1564
00:54:14,750 --> 00:54:17,180
not melted ice cream it's nice juicy

1565
00:54:17,180 --> 00:54:19,400
big plump rolls of ice cream with

1566
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:23,330
a nice thick banana on top with

1567
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:27,620
melted is obscene okay to hot glue

1568
00:54:27,620 --> 00:54:28,003
all over

1569
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:31,070
the top guo stuck with two little

1570
00:54:31,070 --> 00:54:33,950
cherries on top as well and it

1571
00:54:33,950 --> 00:54:37,130
is so good and everyone loves it

1572
00:54:37,190 --> 00:54:39,830
and just because scott is confidently answering

1573
00:54:39,830 --> 00:54:42,380
first doesn't mean that he you could

1574
00:54:42,380 --> 00:54:44,120
have done that as a banana it's

1575
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:45,890
true i just know the answers and

1576
00:54:45,890 --> 00:54:47,480
you're both wrong the bottom advantage flip

1577
00:54:47,540 --> 00:54:48,170
is

1578
00:54:48,470 --> 00:54:50,780
the serving dish and the top is

1579
00:54:50,780 --> 00:54:52,370
a risk own coming in

1580
00:54:54,470 --> 00:54:56,510
i don't consider the utensils if he

1581
00:54:56,510 --> 00:54:59,420
part of the is something non banana

1582
00:54:59,420 --> 00:54:59,810
would say

1583
00:55:00,950 --> 00:55:02,630
no no no sir no sir i

1584
00:55:02,630 --> 00:55:04,160
obviously do consider those to be the

1585
00:55:04,190 --> 00:55:05,180
final question

1586
00:55:06,470 --> 00:55:08,330
what do you why do you think

1587
00:55:08,330 --> 00:55:11,150
that more americans can't find america on

1588
00:55:11,150 --> 00:55:11,660
a map

1589
00:55:12,770 --> 00:55:15,410
laura as a banana my answer to

1590
00:55:15,410 --> 00:55:17,240
that i'm gonna jump in here i

1591
00:55:17,270 --> 00:55:19,820
think that this is mainly due to

1592
00:55:19,820 --> 00:55:22,400
america's educational system because more and more

1593
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:24,500
money is going towards things in the

1594
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:27,350
government that don't matter like ah you

1595
00:55:27,350 --> 00:55:31,250

1596
00:55:31,670 --> 00:55:32,840

1597
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:35,420

the main evey

1770
01:02:23,705 --> 01:02:24,605
went okay

1771
01:02:25,625 --> 01:02:27,545
finding all of these very sexually

i people want want me but they

1773
01:02:37,985 --> 01:02:39,065
when they get me they might be

1774
01:02:39,095 --> 01:02:41,015
disappointed because it's ah there's a small

1775
01:02:41,015 --> 01:02:43,925
window of time where i'm fantastic and

1776
01:02:43,925 --> 01:02:45,785
when i'm fantastic i'm fucking perfect and

1777
01:02:45,785 --> 01:02:46,955
everyone's in love with me but that

1778
01:02:46,955 --> 01:02:51,425
window passes by so quickly so it's

1779
01:02:51,425 --> 01:02:53,045
really i'm a risky thing but i'm

1780
01:02:53,045 --> 01:02:53,885
telling you by being

1781
01:02:53,945 --> 01:02:55,535
so honest about it you know that

1782
01:02:55,535 --> 01:02:57,455
i am actually the avocado

1783
01:02:59,075 --> 01:03:01,175
it's interesting you're looking you're looking down

1784
01:03:01,175 --> 01:03:03,185
into the left every time you say

1785
01:03:03,185 --> 01:03:05,405
you're the avocado oh lee harvey oswald

1786
01:03:05,975 --> 01:03:07,265
i am the avocado

1787
01:03:09,485 --> 01:03:10,385
that was cross-eyed

1788
01:03:13,895 --> 01:03:16,835
sky sky lauren is full of pretty

1789
01:03:16,835 --> 01:03:19,475
words but you know she's not full

1790
01:03:19,475 --> 01:03:22,625
of a big crazy rock hard marble

1791
01:03:22,985 --> 01:03:24,665
that if you don't if you don't

1792
01:03:24,665 --> 01:03:26,135
get around it right you're gonna fuck

1793
01:03:26,135 --> 01:03:30,275
yourself up look i'm an avocado and

1794
01:03:30,455 --> 01:03:31,835
here's another fact about me

1795
01:03:31,895 --> 01:03:33,755
that i know and love is that

1796
01:03:33,755 --> 01:03:35,705
rats can't get enough of me so

1797
01:03:35,705 --> 01:03:37,355
if you have an avacado tree you'd

1798
01:03:37,355 --> 01:03:39,095
better be prepared to have some avocado

1799
01:03:39,095 --> 01:03:42,215
rats because they love me and aren't

1800
01:03:42,215 --> 01:03:44,225
humans and rats so similar in so

1801
01:03:44,225 --> 01:03:44,795
many ways

1802
01:03:46,445 --> 01:03:47,825

1803
01:03:48,755 --> 01:03:51,485
that aren't ours we both like we

1804
01:03:51,485 --> 01:03:54,515
