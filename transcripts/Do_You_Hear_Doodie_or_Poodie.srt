27
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:14,490
living by putting us on television and

00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,380
be a part of this universe anyway

32
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:24,090
ah

33
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:27,840

songs yep

37
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:36,270
and something that got stuck in my

38
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:39,538
head from the goddamned super bowl yeah

39
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,410
is unfortunately a racist chant yeah what

40
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,000
yes i think it's stuck in your

41
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,710
head because it got stuck in my

42
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:48,120
head nights put it in your head

43
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:50,310
i heard you i was in the

44
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:51,510
other room and i heard you and

45
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:52,920
i was like that sounds like that

46
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,270
but i don't think you're actually oh

47
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:55,200
and then you can't know i

48
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:57,570
was actually yeah it's it sucks because

49
00:01:57,570 --> 00:01:59,130
you'll find yourself doing it it's so

50
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:01,920
catchy can we put differently or to

51
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,100
it

52
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:05,190
i think the problem is the melody

53
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:09,090
there's no lyrics but i don't melodies

54
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:10,770

56
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:13,380

00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:33,390
they decide to call themselves that

65
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:36,210
i don't know maybe because the football

66
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:37,500

67
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,670

69
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:43,170
connection of bears with them chicago lauren

70
00:02:43,299 --> 00:02:46,200
have no fucking clue you never saw

71
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:49,230
bear ah no you not even at

72
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:51,090
the zoo all the time sure you

73
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,310
ever saw but walking around via the

74
00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:54,720
zoo i did yeah

75
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,280
yeah california should be the what about

76
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,380
the white sox there should be what

77
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:00,060
about the white sox well the white

78
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:02,790
sox the most unimaginative name i actually

79
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:04,410
think that's one of that's a great

80
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:07,260
one because it's so meaningless yeah don't

81
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:10,020
salute the red sox are good because

82
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:12,540
they have the red wine sauce yeah

83
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,880
like samson with y yeah yeah

84
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,740
why would i think she counts any

85
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:19,950
rate versus any red legs really yeah

86
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:23,250
yeah so reds is okay because that

87
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:24,810
sounds like a racist thing it does

88
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:26,460
but it it but it actually is

89
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:29,280
just about saudi e-mail suck okay great

90
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:32,670
okay gordy reading so these people i'm

91
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:34,050
not going back in the story enough

92
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:35,040
to figure out who they were

93
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,050
we decided to rename the team the

94
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,300
chicago bears in honor of their hosts

95
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:42,150
at cub park what so cubs came

96
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:45,719
first the team lived in arena team

97
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:47,460
moved into wrigley field which was home

98
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:50,040
to the chicago cubs baseball franchise as

99
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,290
with several early nfl franchises the bears

100
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:54,330
derived their nickname from their city's baseball

101
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:55,200
team so

102
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,780
i'm directly some indirectly bear whose sacrifice

103
00:03:58,053 --> 00:04:00,510
because we were rebecca becca the sentence

104
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:02,040
where it's like as most teams do

105
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,320
or something as with several early nfl

106
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,840
franchises they derive that writ so there's

107
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,580
more than one yeah the guy loves

108
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:10,680
to know more about that i'd love

109
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,350
to know more some some cities will

110
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:14,880
have it'll have the same name for

111
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:15,330
both i

112
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,950
believe what about the e yeah what

113
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:19,830
about the eagles philadelphia eagles and then

114
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:21,390
what's the baseball team to fill ilias

115
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:23,100
yeah so that's in a way that's

116
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:25,890
based on because the philadelphia part is

117
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:29,580
based on phillies that's correct okay so

118
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:32,550
that's correct the washington redskins were named

119
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:35,430
the team named the team boston braves

120
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,320
after the city's major league baseball team

121
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:37,800
what

122
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:41,220
the redskins founder named the team boston

123
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:43,770
braves after oh so okay there's a

124
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:45,570
list honestly i can't get into this

125
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:46,620
right now and this is something that

126
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,510
people yeah google at your something you

you're a racist it's fun keep going

136
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:01,860
wow

137
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:04,350
they don't talk about the fun aspects

138
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:07,410
they're having a ball lots of things

139
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:10,500
that the the there's ah it's so

140
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,350
weird that these people won't fucking let

00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:16,020
go i just stop singing horrible and

142
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:17,310
although i don't know what the chant

143
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:18,180
has but it definitely sounds like you

144
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:19,620
shouldn't have a chant know and then

145
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,480
i also would say why don't you

146
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,560
just change the name

147
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:24,210

00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:26,164
at least one team i know here's

149
00:05:26,164 --> 00:05:27,840

326
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:14,135
sense though

327
00:11:16,385 --> 00:11:17,375
i always wonder

328
00:11:18,455 --> 00:11:19,535
i wonder what our baby is gonna

329
00:11:19,548 --> 00:11:20,702

330
00:11:20,705 --> 00:11:22,445

look like cool please look like yeah

337
00:11:33,935 --> 00:11:36,155
she's a beautiful woman but it's very

338
00:11:36,185 --> 00:11:38,435
weird that it depends on the angle

339
00:11:38,495 --> 00:11:40,145
but yeah it looks exactly like me

340
00:11:40,145 --> 00:11:43,085
or exactly it's honestly fascinating that sort

341
00:11:43,085 --> 00:11:44,615
of thing as you watch it unfold

342
00:11:44,735 --> 00:11:45,935
we're like as they get a little

343
00:11:45,935 --> 00:11:47,314
older and stuff and you see that

344
00:11:47,314 --> 00:11:50,495
similarities at certain times or certain expressions

345
00:11:50,495 --> 00:11:51,844
or whatever it's and then sometimes they've

346
00:11:51,844 --> 00:11:53,615
just completely themselves where you can't even

347
00:11:53,615 --> 00:11:54,875
see either of you and that's very

348
00:11:54,875 --> 00:11:57,425
interesting too yeah so cute yeah i

349
00:11:57,425 --> 00:11:58,985

me i love her and

354
00:12:04,955 --> 00:12:06,575
i don't know it's funny that we

355
00:12:07,115 --> 00:12:09,457
are looking at the same thing but

356
00:12:09,511 --> 00:12:12,755

357
00:12:12,755 --> 00:12:14,795

529
00:18:59,015 --> 00:19:00,635

539
00:19:20,285 --> 00:19:21,335
saying you shouldn't want to know that

540
00:19:21,365 --> 00:19:23,285

543
00:19:26,226 --> 00:19:27,304

544
00:19:27,304 --> 00:19:28,655
one time thing they only kiss it

545
00:19:28,655 --> 00:19:30,005

00:19:31,475 --> 00:19:33,035
me out of it i would say

00:19:33,275 --> 00:19:34,835
rather than tell me that why don't

549
00:19:34,835 --> 00:19:36,575
we figure out if there's a problem

550
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:38,435
in our matt well that's true that's

551
00:19:38,435 --> 00:19:40,445
true and work on that yeah without

00:19:40,445 --> 00:19:41,495
that horrible information

553
00:19:41,495 --> 00:19:42,605

583
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:02,380
that no he requests show runners to

see him have sex well that's what

585
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:05,350
a lot of people are saying yeah

586
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:08,950
um that's a direct quote but um

587
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:11,080

589
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:13,810

591
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:16,540
sex scenes and anything i've ever cast

592
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:18,340
in my thoughts are ones like what

593
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:21,250
i mean i can't if if you're

594
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:23,350
at the if you're at the level

595
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:24,640
where you can make a request like

596
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,910
that like fuckin why not why did

597
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:29,260
you say publicly that's the part i

598
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:32,080
well i don't know that he's out

599
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:33,370
i'm not sure how it came out

600
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,530
originally but he said he's a very

601
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:38,262
monogamous person and his he doesn't want

602
00:21:38,262 --> 00:21:39,250
to be doing that anymore

603
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,750
and i'm sure i haven't watched a

604
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:41,560
lot of that show but i'm sure

605
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:42,460
there's a lot of sex in that

606
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:44,800
show and i feel like cutting off

607
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:46,630
though the storylines you can do well

608
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:47,890
possibly or maybe we don't have to

609
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:49,360
see them have sex in order to

610
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,980
know that they could twin curtain blowing

611
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:52,030
or used to do in black and

612
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:53,680
white like he's in bed with somebody

613
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,210
but they're out you know full on

614
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,220
doing everything yeah i will say it

615
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:59,620
was fallen doing stuff i feel like

616
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:02,740
sex scenes are so gratuitous they don't

617
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:04,630
really do anything for me oh wait

618
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:05,950
you know what i mean so i

619
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:08,290
thought that i thought that the discussion

620
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,930
lately is that when a sexy is

621
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:12,880
in a movie it is you haven't

622
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:14,470
like some people are saying i did

623
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:17,069
not give consent to watch that oh

624
00:22:17,142 --> 00:22:18,310
some people are so but that's some

625
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:19,780
snacks and that's taking it

626
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:20,950
to an absurd yeah but i mean

627
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,690
i feel like a character i'm filing

628
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:26,590
the characters you know ah boundaries no

629
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:29,290

00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:39,190

655
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:19,330
also have a hot take about my

656
00:23:19,464 --> 00:23:20,950
scenes oh yeah what is which is

657
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:23,920
that they're never necessary we just like

658
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:26,740
to see corals being yes but it's

659
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:29,230
not the people baby goats necessary to

660
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:30,880
the point they're trying so hard like

661
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:31,270
this was

662
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:34,292
justified it's never nevertheless i said hey

663
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,220
is every right to say he doesn't

664
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:38,350
want to do that anymore he did

665
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:39,850
it for a long time with men

666
00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:41,200
i'm sure many of his shows and

667
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,000
things he was doing that yeah and

668
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,290
he just said i'm not going to

669
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:45,880
anymore they could have said no they

670
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:48,220
could've they agree it's a private discussion

671
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:49,390
is yeah i'm not sure why we

672
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:50,860
are being asked to weigh in on

673
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:51,460
no

674
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:53,050
oh and i think people's reaction is

675
00:23:53,050 --> 00:23:55,090
very like um i'm asking it away

676
00:23:55,090 --> 00:23:56,680

this is such a like sort of

950
00:33:54,355 --> 00:33:56,875
indeed you get more low key energy

951
00:33:58,255 --> 00:33:59,993
like if this this commercial would be

952
00:34:00,146 --> 00:34:02,305

961
00:34:26,995 --> 00:34:29,215
doe hoist her wig into the rafters

962
00:34:34,615 --> 00:34:38,665
ah claire fell her two children that

963
00:34:38,665 --> 00:34:40,405
she's an honorary piss pig if you

964
00:34:40,405 --> 00:34:42,085
know clara peller children who are probably

965
00:34:42,085 --> 00:34:42,685
dead themselves

966
00:34:44,095 --> 00:34:48,355
true usa eighty something nineteen eighty seven

967
00:34:48,385 --> 00:34:49,465
oh wait they would be in their

968
00:34:49,465 --> 00:34:51,505
eighties now i was confused they would

969
00:34:51,565 --> 00:34:52,705
know they would be one hundred or

970
00:34:52,705 --> 00:34:55,375
so really i think i can't do

971
00:34:55,375 --> 00:34:57,295
math isn't it right now but here's

972
00:34:57,295 --> 00:34:59,905
the thing it because we were born

973
00:34:59,935 --> 00:35:02,155
before the twentieth century before the twenty

974
00:35:02,155 --> 00:35:03,805
first century it

975
00:35:04,285 --> 00:35:05,785
you you get to a point where

976
00:35:05,785 --> 00:35:08,245
you lose the sense of how long

977
00:35:08,245 --> 00:35:10,435
ago certain things were oh definitely it's

978
00:35:10,435 --> 00:35:12,685
like the the the seventy s will

979
00:35:12,685 --> 00:35:14,995
always be like thirty years ago yea

980
00:35:14,995 --> 00:35:15,955
i do think the seventy s or

981
00:35:15,955 --> 00:35:19,255
thirty years yeah yeah yeah yeah that's

982
00:35:19,255 --> 00:35:21,355
confusing but it took its refusers children

983
00:35:21,355 --> 00:35:23,005
being in their hundreds because that really

984
00:35:23,185 --> 00:35:24,085
took me for a loop i was

985
00:35:24,115 --> 00:35:25,195
like well she just died she was

986
00:35:25,195 --> 00:35:26,605
eighty five well it wasn't just now

987
00:35:26,605 --> 00:35:28,885
it was when when i was two

988
00:35:28,915 --> 00:35:30,775
she was eighty five yeah and those

989
00:35:30,775 --> 00:35:33,295
people were fifty at least and yeah

990
00:35:33,385 --> 00:35:36,025
another moldering in the grave yeah it's

991
00:35:36,184 --> 00:35:38,635
it's depressing like you watch a movie

992
00:35:38,635 --> 00:35:40,165
like jurassic park and you go like

993
00:35:40,855 --> 00:35:43,105
wow it's jurassic world well see well

994
00:35:43,105 --> 00:35:44,245
dressed the first rescue part

995
00:35:44,275 --> 00:35:46,195
hugo it seems so recent but then

996
00:35:46,195 --> 00:35:47,965
you realize like every single actor in

997
00:35:47,965 --> 00:35:49,645
it has passed away since then it's

998
00:35:49,645 --> 00:35:51,115
like it's crazy i know it's wild

999
00:35:51,385 --> 00:35:52,105
do you think it was a curse

1000
00:35:52,105 --> 00:35:53,695
in that movie none of them are

1001
00:35:55,915 --> 00:35:58,015
from newman to samuel l jackson they're

1002
00:35:58,015 --> 00:36:01,435
all dead yeah in the film yeah

1003
00:36:01,495 --> 00:36:02,785
that's what i mean yeah watch the

1004
00:36:02,785 --> 00:36:04,465
movie they're all dead wow

1005
00:36:07,525 --> 00:36:09,505
samuel laura dern escape but i presumably

1006
00:36:09,505 --> 00:36:10,135
died off camera

1007
00:36:13,765 --> 00:36:16,225
they're still stuck on an island um

1008
00:36:16,855 --> 00:36:19,825
while to me that there's it's one

1009
00:36:19,825 --> 00:36:21,265
of those movies where there's a generation

1010
00:36:21,265 --> 00:36:22,435
of people that grew up on that

1011
00:36:22,435 --> 00:36:25,585
movie and it's a very like a

1012
00:36:25,585 --> 00:36:27,715
sacred movie to them i love it

1013
00:36:27,985 --> 00:36:29,905

1014
00:36:29,905 --> 00:36:31,075
all i was one of my twenties

1015
00:36:31,075 --> 00:36:31,452
or something

1016
00:36:31,525 --> 00:36:33,895
if you were thirty eight i believe

1017
00:36:33,955 --> 00:36:34,885
when the first one came out

1018
00:36:36,145 --> 00:36:38,387

1020
00:36:40,545 --> 00:36:42,085
