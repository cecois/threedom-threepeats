00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:29,730
deep space nine texting wow texted tawny

111
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:32,100
i almost said connie but the her

112
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:34,769
name is connie that's a crow oh

113
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:36,300
it's one of those like alerts that

114
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:37,590
you got that you had and i

115
00:04:37,590 --> 00:04:39,930
got that later i got the lido

116
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:40,320
um

117
00:04:40,676 --> 00:04:42,600
what i wondered about this okay so

118
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,060
she texted tony yeah i have copied

119
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:48,510
did she so she does you take

120
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:50,430
a test and then i'll alert somebody

121
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:52,980
how do they know she'll alert the

122
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:56,760
exposure people this here's where i didn't

123
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,470
know how this works either in janie

124
00:04:58,470 --> 00:04:59,610
kind of figured it out and i

125
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:00,720
think this must be why

126
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,340
what it is is that if you

127
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:04,650
test positive and you put you put

128
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:05,790
it into your phone if you have

129
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:08,250
that enabled to say i just tested

130
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:11,790
positive again then up it i gotta

131
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:13,710
get that app and then it will

132
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:16,410
i think it tracks locations so it

133
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:17,910
tells you hey you were near somebody

134
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:20,010
who just said that they were positive

135
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:20,850
and now look

136
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,920
your stared i keep getting them from

137
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:25,140
hawaii and i haven't been to hawaii

138
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:25,830
in years

139
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,800
it's very straight that makes no sense

140
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,450
it's it's the only alert i ever

141
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:32,970
get regarding covert is that hawaii is

142
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:34,560
telling me someone i've been around his

143
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,240

381
00:14:07,225 --> 00:14:07,855

432
00:15:55,435 --> 00:15:58,045
i thought they got you i didn't

433
00:15:58,045 --> 00:15:59,875
think it was um well i didn't

434
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:01,645
think it was normal i'd never seen

435
00:16:01,645 --> 00:16:03,115
that before but i didn't think i

436
00:16:03,115 --> 00:16:04,465
didn't have a judgment against it i

437
00:16:04,473 --> 00:16:06,265
wasn't like you did i mean i

438
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:07,345
just sort of like oh i've

439
00:16:07,375 --> 00:16:09,895
ever seen anyone do that um but

440
00:16:09,895 --> 00:16:10,945
i thought it was interesting because i

441
00:16:10,945 --> 00:16:12,505
also didn't know you know i hadn't

442
00:16:12,505 --> 00:16:13,915
been to a lot of like um

443
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:17,065
homes of like thirty some things at

444
00:16:17,065 --> 00:16:18,445
that time so it's kind of interesting

445
00:16:18,445 --> 00:16:20,065
just like get a little glimpse of

446
00:16:20,065 --> 00:16:22,465
that um but i also noticed a

447
00:16:22,465 --> 00:16:23,725
handful of people i know are we

448
00:16:23,755 --> 00:16:25,794
where we're liking and reposting that and

449
00:16:25,794 --> 00:16:27,295
i was like i'm curious if people

450
00:16:27,355 --> 00:16:27,535
have

451
00:16:27,565 --> 00:16:28,405
separate rooms

452
00:16:29,485 --> 00:16:31,405
if we had like a huge house

453
00:16:31,435 --> 00:16:33,775
i could see doing that jamie would

454
00:16:33,775 --> 00:16:36,175
never go forth though yeah i sort

455
00:16:36,175 --> 00:16:38,965
of like i assume no idea like

456
00:16:39,025 --> 00:16:42,865
um when we're like ah work like

457
00:16:42,865 --> 00:16:44,935
mike's been shooting a movie and he's

458
00:16:44,935 --> 00:16:46,135
got a lot of night shoots where

459
00:16:46,135 --> 00:16:48,115
like he has to yeah and because

460
00:16:48,115 --> 00:16:49,555
he's that whole time

461
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:50,905
when i think about it if somebody

462
00:16:50,905 --> 00:16:52,345
has to be up super early yeah

463
00:16:52,495 --> 00:16:53,545
you know so we've been doing that

464
00:16:53,545 --> 00:16:54,745
he'll sleep in the guestroom because it's

465
00:16:54,745 --> 00:16:56,125
like he gets home at five am

466
00:16:56,395 --> 00:16:57,475
and he has to sleep and then

467
00:16:57,509 --> 00:16:58,675
meanwhile we would all be waking him

468
00:16:58,675 --> 00:16:59,725
up you know if he was up

469
00:16:59,725 --> 00:17:01,255
in the room so yeah what we've

470
00:17:01,255 --> 00:17:05,155
been doing lately is because we have

471
00:17:05,155 --> 00:17:08,935
the baby monitor on is like i

472
00:17:08,935 --> 00:17:09,775
can i wake

473
00:17:09,775 --> 00:17:11,875
up for anything here's the problem so

474
00:17:12,775 --> 00:17:15,355
occasionally emeralds babbles in the middle of

475
00:17:15,355 --> 00:17:17,605
the night for you know ten minutes

476
00:17:17,605 --> 00:17:18,805
before she goes back to sleep just

477
00:17:18,805 --> 00:17:20,905
blah blah blah blah blah right what

478
00:17:20,905 --> 00:17:22,795
she tells you about is she possessed

479
00:17:23,215 --> 00:17:25,285
yeah pretty much that's what i would

480
00:17:25,285 --> 00:17:26,515
say i mean we tried to get

481
00:17:26,515 --> 00:17:28,555
her possessed when she was born i

482
00:17:28,555 --> 00:17:29,935
think it took okay

483
00:17:30,355 --> 00:17:32,935
but um so she babbles so so

484
00:17:32,935 --> 00:17:34,195
on the nights where i'm supposed to

485
00:17:34,195 --> 00:17:35,965
have the baby monitor on in like

486
00:17:36,505 --> 00:17:39,475
half you know sleeping half you know

487
00:17:39,505 --> 00:17:41,665
checking to seeing oh being aware i

488
00:17:41,665 --> 00:17:43,345
can wake up really easily here's my

489
00:17:43,345 --> 00:17:45,115
issue i can't go back to sleep

490
00:17:45,205 --> 00:17:48,985
oh so this morning three forty five

491
00:17:48,985 --> 00:17:49,675
babbling

492
00:17:50,605 --> 00:17:51,955
that's the end of it i'm up

493
00:17:52,015 --> 00:17:57,205
that's really hard so conversely collab won't

494
00:17:57,205 --> 00:17:59,005
wake up because of the baby monitor

495
00:17:59,635 --> 00:18:01,915
so now she's been sleeping in emeralds

496
00:18:01,915 --> 00:18:05,065
room so she can so she can

497
00:18:05,065 --> 00:18:07,975
hear it and then also to give

498
00:18:07,975 --> 00:18:10,180
me some sleep on

499
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:11,275
yeah that's where i'm not supposed to

500
00:18:11,275 --> 00:18:14,185
be paying attention so right so that's

501
00:18:14,185 --> 00:18:16,585
sort of like maybe every other night

502
00:18:16,585 --> 00:18:18,835
we've been we've been in separate rooms

503
00:18:18,835 --> 00:18:20,665
you know so i don't know yes

504
00:18:20,695 --> 00:18:22,345
that's one solution we're trying right now

505
00:18:22,795 --> 00:18:24,025
i yeah we did some of that

506
00:18:24,025 --> 00:18:26,815
with um with baby early baby stuff

507
00:18:26,815 --> 00:18:28,495
to have like just letting someone sleep

508
00:18:28,525 --> 00:18:29,845
longer so go in the other room

509
00:18:29,845 --> 00:18:30,415
so you can actually

510
00:18:30,415 --> 00:18:32,305
really asleep but this is a totally

511
00:18:32,305 --> 00:18:34,045
different thing this is like you have

512
00:18:34,045 --> 00:18:36,745
your own style you have your own

513
00:18:36,745 --> 00:18:38,965
decor i don't go in there oh

514
00:18:39,595 --> 00:18:40,945
yeah i mean everyone knows your beds

515
00:18:42,175 --> 00:18:43,255
even you don't like it

516
00:18:44,545 --> 00:18:46,885
you're like this sucks i hate this

517
00:18:46,945 --> 00:18:48,265
everything i chose

518
00:18:49,855 --> 00:18:52,555
i can't choose good things i've accepted

519
00:18:52,555 --> 00:18:54,415
it you just choose it

520
00:18:55,645 --> 00:18:58,225
that's growths decor choose it all for

521
00:18:58,225 --> 00:19:00,355
me wow but that's a that's a

522
00:19:00,355 --> 00:19:01,855
relief it's a blessing to not have

523
00:19:01,855 --> 00:19:03,265
to worry about that shit me more

524
00:19:03,265 --> 00:19:04,615
or less the michael cores thing of

525
00:19:04,615 --> 00:19:06,115
like i'm always gonna wear a black

526
00:19:06,115 --> 00:19:07,885
suit jacket and a black t-shirt and

527
00:19:07,885 --> 00:19:09,835
whatever and so yeah he wears the

528
00:19:09,835 --> 00:19:11,335
exact same thing every single day i

529
00:19:11,335 --> 00:19:12,955
love that and yeah the same thing

530
00:19:12,955 --> 00:19:14,695
every day i would love that he

531
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:15,745
eats the same thing every day

532
00:19:15,835 --> 00:19:17,245
no i just just that's a separate

533
00:19:17,245 --> 00:19:18,925
topic it's like wow same thing every

534
00:19:18,925 --> 00:19:20,065
day i would do that i just

535
00:19:20,065 --> 00:19:21,295
saw a clip of someone else's eat

536
00:19:21,295 --> 00:19:22,435
the same thing every day but i

537
00:19:22,915 --> 00:19:25,645
i'm i'm totally opposed to that if

538
00:19:25,645 --> 00:19:27,685
it was something really good but you

539
00:19:27,685 --> 00:19:29,095
know what even that's that's not true

540
00:19:29,155 --> 00:19:30,145
that's not true i think i used

541
00:19:30,145 --> 00:19:31,045
to be like that and i'm not

542
00:19:31,045 --> 00:19:32,575
like that anymore i think i could

543
00:19:32,575 --> 00:19:35,305
very easily do that because i eat

544
00:19:35,965 --> 00:19:37,795
you know for dinner that's when i

545
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:39,445
probably wanna mix it up the most

546
00:19:39,445 --> 00:19:41,695
but for breakfast and lunch i eat

547
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:44,125
strictly from hunger it's just like yeah

548
00:19:44,155 --> 00:19:45,895
to not be hungry anymore and i

549
00:19:45,895 --> 00:19:47,635
could i could without thinking about it

550
00:19:47,884 --> 00:19:50,995
same thing every yeah i mean i

551
00:19:50,995 --> 00:19:52,225
eat the same thing for breakfast every

552
00:19:52,225 --> 00:19:54,323
single day me too so although i

553
00:19:54,325 --> 00:19:56,095
mix it up on the weekends

554
00:19:56,125 --> 00:19:59,425
oh get low crazy yeah make my

555
00:19:59,578 --> 00:20:01,465

660
00:23:49,785 --> 00:23:51,705
it's it's very adorable i loved it

661
00:23:51,705 --> 00:23:53,805
it was so cute and yeah it's

662
00:23:53,805 --> 00:23:55,545
in it's in ah in griffith park

663
00:23:55,545 --> 00:23:56,955
here in l a is that yeah

664
00:23:56,955 --> 00:23:59,745
and it's like there's these huge trains

665
00:23:59,745 --> 00:24:01,185
that are just sitting there like old

666
00:24:01,185 --> 00:24:04,185
style anchor the normal trains you know

667
00:24:04,185 --> 00:24:05,595
what they're so close up they seem

668
00:24:05,595 --> 00:24:05,985
bigger

669
00:24:07,455 --> 00:24:08,955
you don't normally get to last that

670
00:24:08,985 --> 00:24:11,775
close to right that's right there circle

671
00:24:11,775 --> 00:24:13,605
sup and then there's a train that

672
00:24:13,605 --> 00:24:16,065
you get to ride around a loop

673
00:24:16,065 --> 00:24:19,751
twice and it's very adorable and as

674
00:24:19,751 --> 00:24:21,135
it was really cute and holly loved

675
00:24:21,135 --> 00:24:23,235
it ah and then they give you

676
00:24:23,265 --> 00:24:24,585
they had little like goody bags with

677
00:24:24,585 --> 00:24:27,195
like um engineer hats and bandai

678
00:24:27,195 --> 00:24:29,647
yeah oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

679
00:24:29,652 --> 00:24:31,125
it was just very charming and then

680
00:24:31,125 --> 00:24:31,995
one thing that i thought was very

681
00:24:31,995 --> 00:24:33,465
interesting is as you're riding the train

682
00:24:33,465 --> 00:24:36,315
around the loop there's so there's the

683
00:24:36,315 --> 00:24:38,145
highway's right there on the outside of

684
00:24:38,145 --> 00:24:40,275
the thing and then there's a little

685
00:24:40,275 --> 00:24:43,665
sliver that um fenced in where people

686
00:24:43,665 --> 00:24:46,155
are riding horses that's like the width

687
00:24:46,155 --> 00:24:47,025
of a horse

688
00:24:47,535 --> 00:24:49,515
and then there's like the traffic on

689
00:24:49,515 --> 00:24:51,525
the other side of them so there's

690
00:24:51,525 --> 00:24:53,145
like this lane in the middle of

691
00:24:53,145 --> 00:24:54,945
the highway that's like for people to

692
00:24:54,945 --> 00:24:56,655
ride horses i just found that very

693
00:24:56,655 --> 00:24:59,085
interesting i used to go horses famously

694
00:24:59,085 --> 00:25:01,785
chill animals i'm sure they love that

695
00:25:01,785 --> 00:25:04,455
part yes just being surrounded by whizzing

696
00:25:04,455 --> 00:25:07,035
cars i bet they just they're in

697
00:25:07,035 --> 00:25:07,515
heaven

698
00:25:07,815 --> 00:25:09,705
yeah i used to go hiking there

699
00:25:09,705 --> 00:25:11,865
and it was always like a sign

700
00:25:11,865 --> 00:25:13,425
of oh wow i've gotten this far

701
00:25:13,425 --> 00:25:14,565
when you would get to the part

702
00:25:14,565 --> 00:25:15,825
where you would see the train tracks

703
00:25:15,949 --> 00:25:18,795
yeah yeah yeah the horsey signs yeah

704
00:25:19,035 --> 00:25:20,895
um i've seen the horses from afar

705
00:25:20,895 --> 00:25:22,485
but it was interesting to be on

706
00:25:22,485 --> 00:25:25,365
the inside looking out and um it

707
00:25:25,365 --> 00:25:26,805
was delightful and i also you know

708
00:25:26,865 --> 00:25:27,675
one of those things i

709
00:25:27,705 --> 00:25:29,895
feel like scott i'm curious when you'll

710
00:25:29,895 --> 00:25:31,665

711
00:25:31,665 --> 00:25:33,855
with emerald yeah we haven't joined anybody

712
00:25:33,855 --> 00:25:35,055
she doesn't need to go to a

713
00:25:35,055 --> 00:25:36,315
lot of places but i feel like

714
00:25:36,315 --> 00:25:37,425
now holly is at a point because

715
00:25:37,425 --> 00:25:39,135
you can't walk around that i'm like

716
00:25:39,255 --> 00:25:41,175
she needs to see some stuff so

717
00:25:41,175 --> 00:25:42,675
like even if i'm really tired i'm

718
00:25:42,675 --> 00:25:44,295
like we're go into the thing you

719
00:25:44,295 --> 00:25:46,005
know it's like we're going to whatever

720
00:25:46,005 --> 00:25:47,835
thing i have planned will be

721
00:25:47,835 --> 00:25:49,575
be accomplished that day because i want

722
00:25:49,575 --> 00:25:53,115
her to see something and experience something

723
00:25:53,115 --> 00:25:55,035
and you know some whether she wants

724
00:25:55,035 --> 00:25:57,945
to or not yeah we sometimes try

725
00:25:57,945 --> 00:25:59,055
to walk around with her

726
00:26:00,105 --> 00:26:02,175
yeah yeah i mean yeah but at

727
00:26:02,175 --> 00:26:04,725
this point yeah no but she doesn't

728
00:26:04,725 --> 00:26:06,285
have like that pent-up energy where she

729
00:26:06,285 --> 00:26:07,653
like needs to run around you know

730
00:26:07,755 --> 00:26:09,225
she's not crawling yet right so i

731
00:26:09,225 --> 00:26:10,695
know she has the pent-up energy where

732
00:26:10,695 --> 00:26:13,125
she wants to like sort of stand

733
00:26:13,125 --> 00:26:16,335
up and wave yams and go yeah

734
00:26:17,475 --> 00:26:19,425
that is the bounties she's been making

735
00:26:19,425 --> 00:26:20,235
now what's the noise

736
00:26:21,975 --> 00:26:23,265

still do and it's cooler than you

885
00:32:04,425 --> 00:32:05,115

exactly as cold as i've thought i

889
00:32:12,525 --> 00:32:14,745
think it's always it's always really cold

890
00:32:14,745 --> 00:32:16,185
but i think if you've never been

891
00:32:16,185 --> 00:32:17,205
there you would think it's not going

892
00:32:17,205 --> 00:32:19,065
to be cold for a long time

893
00:32:19,065 --> 00:32:21,645
i would forget how when i started

894
00:32:21,645 --> 00:32:23,565
going up there regularly for sand up

you had to like go to a

954
00:34:31,785 --> 00:34:33,525
place a lot of times like yeah

955
00:34:33,555 --> 00:34:34,875
like that what would you pick like

956
00:34:34,875 --> 00:34:36,885
if you're like you're old and you're

957
00:34:36,885 --> 00:34:37,425
like you

958
00:34:37,455 --> 00:34:40,245

like for vibe or food or a

960
00:34:44,115 --> 00:34:45,795
combo it's just what why do you

961
00:34:45,795 --> 00:34:48,045
think they chose those places i don't

962
00:34:48,045 --> 00:34:50,295
know because they feel very old school

963
00:34:50,325 --> 00:34:51,945
so it's kind of like yeah it's

964
00:34:51,945 --> 00:34:53,985
yeah it's like reminiscent of their there

965
00:34:54,195 --> 00:34:55,845
when they were growing up and times

966
00:34:55,845 --> 00:34:57,012
were good and all and

967
00:34:57,645 --> 00:34:59,505
they weren't old pieces of shit that's

968
00:34:59,505 --> 00:35:00,705
so depressing

969
00:35:01,935 --> 00:35:05,385
what's depressing being old yeah i think

970
00:35:05,685 --> 00:35:08,565
being old and reminiscing about the times

971
00:35:08,595 --> 00:35:10,755
when you were young why is it

972
00:35:10,875 --> 00:35:12,405
when you're just gonna accept his theory

973
00:35:14,175 --> 00:35:15,645
yeah why is it they make fifties

974
00:35:15,645 --> 00:35:17,265
diners but they don't make sixty s

975
00:35:17,265 --> 00:35:19,005
diners they don't make seventy s diners

976
00:35:19,065 --> 00:35:21,495

977
00:35:21,495 --> 00:35:23,115

1132
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:08,730
let's be real that was enough we

1133
00:41:08,790 --> 00:41:11,880
found lighting really wanting back of cutting

1134
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:14,580
the doughnuts into like eight pieces because

1135
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:15,480
you really only wa

1136
00:41:15,484 --> 00:41:17,130
don't like you see the them all

1137
00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:18,840
in one minute yeah yeah you said

1138
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:19,827
that i do like i want to

1139
00:41:19,827 --> 00:41:21,900
try every single one but yeah but

1140
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:23,430
you you really only want a taste

1141
00:41:23,430 --> 00:41:24,660
of what and they all taste exactly

1142
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:26,340
the same thing for me is doughnuts

1143
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:28,140
as as a sweet treat donuts are

1144
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:31,470
never fully not worth it they're not

1145
00:41:31,470 --> 00:41:32,850
fully worth it like a piece of

1146
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,110
cake or a piece of pie some

1147
00:41:34,110 --> 00:41:35,610
ice cream and that's why i don't

1148
00:41:35,731 --> 00:41:38,760
the dream is different because they're heated

1149
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:41,430
it's not that different though but when

1150
00:41:41,430 --> 00:41:42,900
you get that melted your mouth hey

1151
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:44,820
my high school had this thing and

1152
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:45,990
i'd never heard a crispy cream but

1153
00:41:45,990 --> 00:41:47,100
then in my high school day was

1154
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:47,760
that there was a thing where i

1155
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:48,780
was like you could buy a box

1156
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:49,620
of krispy kreme and they would be

1157
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:51,090
delivered on a certain day they get

1158
00:41:51,090 --> 00:41:53,220
like a hundred million boxes it's everyone

1159
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:55,470
bottom yeah and you get your own

1160
00:41:55,470 --> 00:41:55,800
boss

1161
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:58,500
box and then that would be like

1162
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:00,540
who doesn't donuts yeah just dozen doughnuts

1163
00:42:00,570 --> 00:42:02,310
yeah i would just scarf from down

1164
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:03,510
i'm i wouldn't eat twelve in a

1165
00:42:03,510 --> 00:42:06,180
sitting but i'd eat gu three and

1166
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:07,677
then i take them home which and

1167
00:42:07,677 --> 00:42:10,440
then really it's probably i take them

1168
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:12,150
home and put them in the microwave

1169
00:42:13,170 --> 00:42:14,130
you put them in the microwave for

1170
00:42:14,130 --> 00:42:15,960
like three you're gonna eat eight

1171
00:42:16,590 --> 00:42:17,730
but i'm in the micro for exactly

1172
00:42:17,730 --> 00:42:20,340
six seconds right and it's like like

1173
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:22,020
is that how long just melted on

1174
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:22,260
that

1175
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:26,190
bucking bronco i believe that was eight

1176
00:42:26,430 --> 00:42:27,840
oh that was okay sorry yeah i

1177
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:30,750
don't know the reference it's a very

1178
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:32,848
nice reference actually this movie was not

1179
00:42:32,850 --> 00:42:34,950
as measured there was a luke perry

1180
00:42:34,950 --> 00:42:37,320
started in a um a rodeo movie

1181
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:39,630
ah called eight seconds because that's the

1182
00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:40,890
amount of time you have to last

1183
00:42:40,890 --> 00:42:42,960
i believe on the horse before like

1184
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:43,260
them

1185
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:45,270
throws you off before you can get

1186
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:47,670
off of it isn't that right it's

1187
00:42:47,670 --> 00:42:49,560
like if you can last eight seconds

1188
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:51,900
you can jump off because you've lasted

1189
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:54,810
as long as isn't that isn't or

1190
00:42:54,810 --> 00:42:56,760
i think eight something like minimum i

1191
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:57,090
don't know

1192
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:00,720
i think eight seconds is the minimum

1193
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:02,430
yeah in order to in order to

1194
00:43:02,430 --> 00:43:04,620
qualify as anyone anyone on one for

1628
01:00:40,385 --> 01:00:41,765
title last vegas

1629
01:00:41,795 --> 01:00:43,145
was he said another title what was

1630
01:00:43,145 --> 01:00:43,835

1631
01:00:45,335 --> 01:00:47,135
i said vegas baby i don't know

1632
01:00:47,555 --> 01:00:50,465
i said goodbye vegas the answer of

1633
01:00:50,465 --> 01:00:54,935
course is old vegas nice vic because

1634
01:00:54,935 --> 01:00:56,525
it was about old man going to

1635
01:00:56,555 --> 01:00:58,925
las vegas and i was complaining that

1636
01:00:58,955 --> 01:01:00,665
old vegas isn't really a play on

1637
01:01:00,665 --> 01:01:03,545
anything and that's why they didn't do

1638
01:01:03,995 --> 01:01:05,045
yeah exactly that's why

1639
01:01:05,810 --> 01:01:07,340
last vegas which is a play i

1640
01:01:07,340 --> 01:01:08,660
didn't know that that was called last

1641
01:01:08,660 --> 01:01:10,340
week the only thing i remember about

1642
01:01:10,340 --> 01:01:12,380
that is the entertainment weekly interview where

1643
01:01:12,410 --> 01:01:15,560
morgan freeman said that he would allow

1644
01:01:15,560 --> 01:01:17,000
a director to tell him to speed

1645
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:18,230
up or slow down and that's the

1646
01:01:18,260 --> 01:01:19,520
only thing a director would ever say

1647
01:01:19,550 --> 01:01:22,280
