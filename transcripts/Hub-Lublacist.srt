packed it's funny it wasn't open a

43
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:48,510
second ago i guess there's a there's

44
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:50,730
a ghost in here what if it's

45
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:51,780
just a big fly

46
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:53,940
it helps like choosing

47
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,840
yeah fly leading you guys are like

48
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:01,710
yeah that's so gross got what flies

49
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,840
fly killer that's like a tennis racket

50
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,720
that electrocute them yes ah which makes

51
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,430
you feel like you're getting exercise while

52
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:10,860
killing so it's really to sleep over

53
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:12,060
but every once in a while and

54
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,100
i don't think flies deserve life i

55
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:14,970
don't feel bad

56
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,190
huh but i everyone's so well i

57
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:19,230
feel like studios definitely don't well it's

58
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:20,280
kind of insane when you kill a

59
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,150
fly with this thing and then it

60
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:22,980
doesn't immediately die and goes like it

61
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:24,871
starts to like smoke up and then

62
00:02:24,871 --> 00:02:26,490
you have to eat it what you

63
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:29,130
have knows it's a smell so delicious

64
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,480
it's been cool it's meat yeah it's

65
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,650
way now it's a waste to throw

66
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:31,950
it away

67
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,087

i hosted it it lasted for a

73
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:49,920
year and then it was very obvious

74
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,540
that the show was not coming back

75
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:52,530
even though they wouldn't say that it

76
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:53,250
was cafe hey

77
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,080
they would just avert their your gaze

78
00:02:55,242 --> 00:02:56,220
oh yeah you ever talked to them

79
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:57,840
and so i want we had in

80
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,240
the script the cameras will just turn

81
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,710
off spontaneously

82
00:03:02,925 --> 00:03:04,080

83
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:06,900
daniel turnoff should keep talking um i

84
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,337
had in the script that i would

85
00:03:08,337 --> 00:03:09,660
the last thing that i would say

86
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:10,890
right down the barrel of the camera

87
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:13,230
was see you in hell and then

88
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:15,570
the fuckin this producer that we had

89
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,520
was like no you can't say that

90
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:18,710
it was clearly because he was still

91
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,580
gonna work there and he was worried

92
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:21,960
it was going to turn the story

93
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:22,950
because he was religious

94
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:25,590
i won't be there he yeah he

95
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:27,150

00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:31,890
like you were talking about it it's

131
00:04:31,895 --> 00:04:33,930
a job half done yeah that's perfect

132
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:38,280
yeah perfect that's absolutely perfect it's absolutely

133
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,500
perfect so you so so what did

134
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,730
you say instead of see you in

135
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:42,060
hell

136
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:45,480
by i honestly can't remember

137
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:47,910
and that's the end of a season

138
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:49,230
made a laid back formula

139
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:52,500
i can't wait till they reboot the

140
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,510
show without me one day which they

141
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:55,830
did and then that didn't last either

142
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:58,170
oh yeah did years later no i

143
00:04:58,170 --> 00:04:59,190
don't think so i think less at

144
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:00,750
the same time who was on that

145
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:02,490
i don't owe as much of new

146
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,624
comedians that i was not familiar with

147
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:07,050
i never saw it i never too

148
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:09,900
painful yeah you can't go back there

149
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:10,560
couldn't do it

150
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:11,850
no no no whoever is hosting no

151
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:12,870
you shut up now i don't watch

152
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:14,820
that either you know what if they

153
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,350
regulated that i would just pop it

154
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:17,700
they scrubbed that from the internet like

155
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,200
there's no videos there no you can't

156
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,150
even see anything expertly scrubbed i'm like

157
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,620
i'm a little confused by that because

158
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:23,550
there are things that i think should

159
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:25,650
be scrubbed and arm yeah sure i'll

160
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:26,700
just get rid of some like show

161
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,410
that was like whatever and then just

162
00:05:28,413 --> 00:05:30,090
like erased weird leaning how did that

163
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:30,720
happen netflow

164
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,060
looks like scrubs one of their own

165
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:34,772
shows that oh yeah is on netflix

166
00:05:34,772 --> 00:05:35,820
yeah why not just have it on

167
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:38,130
there forever like who cares and it's

168
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:40,500
bandwidth may yeah but the idea that

169
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:42,540
it might gain an audience later like

170
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:44,160
a show you didn't didn't perform well

171
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,020
in star tile what's like the things

172
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:47,190
i'll never be able to find the

173
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:49,650
spotify algorithm has made the most popular

174
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:50,880
pavement song this weird

175
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,748
rd b-side i think like that ah

176
00:05:52,748 --> 00:05:54,210
the and there was an article about

177
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:56,460
i don't recall why that particular song

178
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:58,440
became the most popular pavement song but

179
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,760
now they play it in concert and

180
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,530
everyone's like yeah because everyone's heard that

181
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:04,590
sounds so weird algorithm did this algorithm

182
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:06,270
see we need to be afraid we

183
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:08,250
do is the algorithm just listening it's

184
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,960
know constantly afraid we need to free

185
00:06:09,962 --> 00:06:11,040
all the time the flout

186
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:13,828

ipods you have more storage than phones

287
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:32,250
but now phones have more storage than

288
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:34,290
ipods and they discontinued ipods used to

289
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:36,270
have more storage the phones but now

290
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,700
phones twenty four bucks are big hits

291
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:41,730
yeah i pod where that's what plays

292
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:43,290
my music and my cars it's like

293
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:44,490
we're using the phone for so many

294
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:45,660
things i don't really care but i'm

295
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:48,000
just like consolidating it onto so i

296
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:49,110
like being a new phone

297
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,580
just came out never like so much

298
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:52,495
storage i'm like this is great but

299
00:09:52,495 --> 00:09:53,670
you know what i'm i would sort

300
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:54,690
of household items in there and i

301
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:56,070
guess i could just use like when

302
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:57,540
i pad for this but like i

303
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:58,320
would sort of like to have a

304
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,590
spotify device oh a whole device just

305
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:03,210
for spotify it's like saying why don't

306
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:05,100
you just buy a second phone hey

307
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,050
you know what i liked about the

308
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:09,150
ipod i really enjoyed the clicks on

309
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:09,240
the

310
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:12,340
but i like robin when you're trying

311
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:14,440
to drive and you reach down to

312
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,840
fast-forward to song but you have to

313
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,850
look down now to press the right

314
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:20,620
button because there's no click or there's

315
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,030
no like tactile yeah but actually i

316
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:24,160
think we have talked about this but

317
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,690
i know exactly where my thumb goes

318
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:26,650
on the fuckin phone because i'm not

319
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:28,810
at all goddamn day because it's depressed

320
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:30,070
and yes it's

321
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,390
hey depressed i'm on my phone old

322
00:10:31,472 --> 00:10:34,330
ah anyway so i'm on the plane

323
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,500
and i go to sleep with my

324
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:38,320
ipod on and a song with a

325
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,650
super slow fade-out occurs and i just

326
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:45,760
drift into the deepest slumber and then

327
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:49,450
a really fast song starts after that

328
00:10:49,450 --> 00:10:50,320
song and it's

329
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,930
it scares me awake where i don't

330
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:54,340
know what's happening and then i see

331
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:58,120
two people next to me and i

332
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,620
guess as part of my dream i

333
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:01,720
thought they were people i thought i

334
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,160
was in my house there were people

335
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,320
in my house looking at me on

336
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,120
the bed or something he's grieve get

337
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,500
out with

338
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:11,380
and which makes it

339
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,630
it would be a great tactic for

340
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:14,830
the people who break into your home

341
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:17,890
and everyone on the plane looks at

342
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:19,240
me including the two people next to

343
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:22,120
me and i went i apologize i

344
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,947
was having a weird dream but i

345
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:25,240
didn't know what was happening and they

346
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,850
just were like glared at me you

347
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:29,290

348
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,380
so lane right um and pablo frightened

349
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:33,640
because it was one of those things

350
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,750
right like oh i'm in my bed

351
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:36,010
and i wake up and to start

352
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:36,130
i

353
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,780
felt like i was in like a

354
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,250
science fiction show or something where two

355
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:41,227
people looking at me it's very own

356
00:11:41,227 --> 00:11:43,000
material in a human zoo yeah i

357
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,640
love to sleep on the twenty six

358
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:46,600
but there's something very vulnerable about it

359
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,160
when you're sleeping on the plane it's

360
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,600
like yeah yeah you don't know what

361
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,014
you're doing you don't know i could

362
00:11:51,014 --> 00:11:53,680
sailing camp doing anything be moving where

363
00:11:53,782 --> 00:11:55,330
you're going i'm drooling and like you

364
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:56,320
know yeah and n

365
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,120
anyone can see it and everyone sees

366
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,740
everyone turns and looks you're talking about

367
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:02,350
every segment fighting the the people that

368
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:03,790
can actually our name cross my mind

369
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:05,290
but yeah for sure what's funny is

370

my neck pillow and i have to

441
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:23,560

442
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,570
window or aisle because window i can

443
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:26,800
curl up and just go into the

444
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:28,510
wind into the window yes i've always

445
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:30,070
preferred aisle but but now if you

446
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:31,525
have to sleep on a plane yeah

447
00:14:31,525 --> 00:14:32,620
you don't want to can't do it

448
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:34,600
without a window no because then people

449
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,044
are going to step over you wake

450
00:14:36,044 --> 00:14:37,120
you up i would rather

451
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,070
or be woken up and wake somebody

452
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:41,410
also from aisle all the way yeah

453
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,400
you would rather be woken up the

454
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,960
wings imo i'd rather move for someone

455
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,160
else than have to ask somebody to

456
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,560
move for me okay yeah i don't

457
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:49,420

459
00:14:51,801 --> 00:14:53,346

00:30:39,325 --> 00:30:40,825
but um but it is very good

924
00:30:40,825 --> 00:30:43,345
it's it's yeah it's interesting for season

925
00:30:43,345 --> 00:30:44,425
with new york and i really was

926
00:30:44,428 --> 00:30:47,125
enjoying it yeah that one was very

927
00:30:47,125 --> 00:30:50,095
fascinating season two made me depressed because

928
00:30:50,095 --> 00:30:51,355
it was the la cast and it

929
00:30:51,355 --> 00:30:52,915
seemed everyone was having the exact same

930
00:30:52,915 --> 00:30:55,675
arguments that they had twenty five years

931
00:30:55,675 --> 00:30:56,815
ago and i was like do people

932
00:30:56,815 --> 00:30:58,645
ever change and

933
00:30:59,785 --> 00:31:01,525
even in this new new orleans one

934
00:31:01,525 --> 00:31:03,205
it's kind of like the the super

935
00:31:03,205 --> 00:31:05,665
religious guy is still super religious but

936
00:31:05,725 --> 00:31:07,435
don't you think that because they were

937
00:31:07,435 --> 00:31:09,655
on that show together which like really

938
00:31:09,655 --> 00:31:12,085
was i'm very confused as to whether

939
00:31:12,085 --> 00:31:14,275
this is a new cast know it's

940
00:31:14,275 --> 00:31:17,185
the old csx national united last guys

941
00:31:17,215 --> 00:31:18,865
into the same house or whatever

942
00:31:19,015 --> 00:31:20,635
god if they can get the same

943
00:31:20,665 --> 00:31:21,835
yeah but who had the same idea

944
00:31:22,225 --> 00:31:23,605
and so we don't know if they

945
00:31:23,605 --> 00:31:25,285
can get the same every season to

946
00:31:25,285 --> 00:31:26,845
that could not every place was gone

947
00:31:26,875 --> 00:31:28,525
okay so that was similar don't you

948
00:31:28,525 --> 00:31:30,025
feel like because because i think this

949
00:31:30,025 --> 00:31:32,065
is rather than saying they don't change

950
00:31:32,065 --> 00:31:33,115
i feel like if they were on

951
00:31:33,115 --> 00:31:35,455
a show together and the personalities clash

952
00:31:35,485 --> 00:31:36,655
whatever way and it was on tv

953
00:31:36,655 --> 00:31:37,795
and that was before there was a

954
00:31:37,795 --> 00:31:38,815
lot of reality tv and this was

955
00:31:38,815 --> 00:31:39,175
a huge

956
00:31:39,175 --> 00:31:41,695
i'd show that everyone saw and so

957
00:31:41,695 --> 00:31:42,925
you're talking talking about that for the

958
00:31:42,925 --> 00:31:44,245
rest of your life yeah i probably

959
00:31:44,245 --> 00:31:46,375
hold onto a lot of those things

960
00:31:46,375 --> 00:31:47,545
and go like oh there's this fucking

961
00:31:47,545 --> 00:31:49,315
guy again for the last thirty years

962
00:31:49,315 --> 00:31:51,205
i've been hearing about how i didn't

963
00:31:51,205 --> 00:31:52,429
say the right thing when you did

964
00:31:52,429 --> 00:31:54,175
that yes i would love the my

965
00:31:54,205 --> 00:31:55,615
point i think with how people don't

966
00:31:55,615 --> 00:31:57,085
change is like they get that out

967
00:31:57,085 --> 00:31:58,945
of the way kind of early where

968
00:31:58,945 --> 00:31:59,335
everyone like

969
00:31:59,335 --> 00:32:00,985
like hashes out their issues of what

970
00:32:00,985 --> 00:32:02,725
happened on the show than they either

971
00:32:02,725 --> 00:32:04,915
forgive each other whatever i'm saying after

972
00:32:04,915 --> 00:32:07,375
that point they then just start repeating

973
00:32:07,375 --> 00:32:09,805
their actions from the books from the

974
00:32:09,805 --> 00:32:12,025
old season or they have the exact

975
00:32:12,025 --> 00:32:13,735
same arguments that they had in the

976
00:32:13,735 --> 00:32:15,445
old season the exact same way that

977
00:32:15,445 --> 00:32:16,945
is weird and the people fly off

978
00:32:16,945 --> 00:32:18,295
the handle in the exact same way

979
00:32:18,295 --> 00:32:19,165
they used to

980
00:32:19,495 --> 00:32:20,935
no one seems to have matured i

981
00:32:20,935 --> 00:32:22,225
think it's different for this new new

982
00:32:22,225 --> 00:32:24,985
orleans season where people have like grown

983
00:32:24,985 --> 00:32:27,925

1071
00:35:44,935 --> 00:35:47,455
interesting that those those didn't take off

1072
00:35:47,485 --> 00:35:49,345
the way that sometimes like fashion from

1073
00:35:49,345 --> 00:35:50,935

fashion scale michael jackson but yeah i

1077

one dollar scale to three million dollars

1318
00:44:09,995 --> 00:44:11,345
okay and then the question i have

1319
00:44:11,375 --> 00:44:12,005

i interesting is why would you do

1322
00:44:18,185 --> 00:44:19,085
it if you as long as you

1323
00:44:19,085 --> 00:44:20,315
didn't have to say about like that

1324
00:44:20,345 --> 00:44:21,485
or i think it was that the

1325
00:44:21,485 --> 00:44:24,035
additive in theory i would want to

1326
00:44:24,035 --> 00:44:25,385
be the one saying lay down but

1327
00:44:25,385 --> 00:44:27,095
yeah practice i think you'd be better

1328
00:44:27,095 --> 00:44:28,402
if i was in because i'm sure

1329
00:44:28,427 --> 00:44:29,825
be ripped to shred here's what i'm

1330
00:44:29,825 --> 00:44:30,395
gonna tell you

1331
00:44:33,035 --> 00:44:35,915
that's not algae doesn't um here's what

1332
00:44:35,915 --> 00:44:37,235
i can tell you everyone in the

1333
00:44:37,235 --> 00:44:40,055
movie says it at one point but

1334
00:44:40,085 --> 00:44:42,245
only one character will say it in

1335
00:44:42,245 --> 00:44:44,315
the final cut oh so it's like

1336
00:44:44,315 --> 00:44:45,935
whoever is the best yeah it's a

1337
00:44:45,935 --> 00:44:48,635

00:44:48,695 --> 00:44:50,015
metal yeah okay fine i'll do it

1339
00:44:50,105 --> 00:44:51,545
we've somehow yes we've

1340
00:44:51,605 --> 00:44:53,105
fashioned script yeah we fashioned the script

1341
00:44:53,105 --> 00:44:54,725
somehow so that everyone gets to say

1342
00:44:54,725 --> 00:44:56,105
this line on their land to make

1343
00:44:56,105 --> 00:44:58,565
sense but yeah so that we can

1344
00:44:58,565 --> 00:44:59,945
cut all of the yes

1345
00:45:02,255 --> 00:45:02,916
only people

1346
00:45:04,115 --> 00:45:06,755
reflect says the same line in their

1347
00:45:06,755 --> 00:45:08,735
dialogue never in the same scene

1348
00:45:09,845 --> 00:45:11,675
that's that's great do you ever have

1349
00:45:11,675 --> 00:45:13,055
a house that you made up in

1350
00:45:13,055 --> 00:45:14,315
your mind that you pictured in a

1351
00:45:14,315 --> 00:45:16,145
book that you read that you um

1352
00:45:16,265 --> 00:45:19,055
remember why do i know i know

1353
00:45:19,055 --> 00:45:20,284
you do that that i pictured in

1354
00:45:20,284 --> 00:45:21,515
a book that i read okay for

1355
00:45:21,515 --> 00:45:22,955
example right now i just just think

1356
00:45:22,955 --> 00:45:24,545
you're mostly written a book was just

1357
00:45:24,545 --> 00:45:26,345
see what this house that i made

1358
00:45:26,345 --> 00:45:27,815
up when i was reading a book

1359
00:45:28,055 --> 00:45:29,285
and i you know made up with

1360
00:45:29,285 --> 00:45:29,885
the house look like

1361
00:45:30,005 --> 00:45:31,265
whose house and i was just thinking

1362
00:45:31,265 --> 00:45:33,095
about the house just now randomly problems

1363
00:45:33,095 --> 00:45:34,355
in my head and i don't know

1364
00:45:34,356 --> 00:45:37,865
why but what was it the book

1365
00:45:37,865 --> 00:45:39,665
was called nothing to see here and

1366
00:45:39,665 --> 00:45:42,845
it's actually a fantastic book i zipped

1367
00:45:42,845 --> 00:45:43,955
right through it everyone tell you it's

1368
00:45:43,955 --> 00:45:46,265
about because there's a twist and i

1369
00:45:46,265 --> 00:45:48,005
didn't read the summary on the flap

1370
00:45:48,005 --> 00:45:49,055
and i was so happy i didn't

1371
00:45:49,055 --> 00:45:50,086
because i didn't know it

1372
00:45:50,195 --> 00:45:51,155
gonna have it the twist is there

1373
00:45:51,155 --> 00:45:53,015
was something to see yeah there was

1374
00:45:53,015 --> 00:45:54,459
something to see and it doesn't they

1375
00:45:54,459 --> 00:45:56,015
braid it on the fucking book which

1376
00:45:56,015 --> 00:45:57,245
i thought was kind of crazy because

1377
00:45:57,245 --> 00:45:59,405
it's a fun twist yeah yeah marketing

1378
00:45:59,555 --> 00:46:00,875
but anyway i just picture i made

1379
00:46:00,875 --> 00:46:02,465
up this like beautiful mansion with this

1380
00:46:02,465 --> 00:46:04,385

1381
00:46:04,385 --> 00:46:06,485
book and i just pictured in my

1382
00:46:06,485 --> 00:46:07,445
mind that i don't know why you

a

1386
00:46:10,325 --> 00:46:12,995
one question if you ever walked into

now familiar and i was so surprised

1483
00:49:30,245 --> 00:49:31,745
by the song because i thought it

1484
00:49:31,745 --> 00:49:33,965
would be because you're playing no i'm

1485
00:49:33,965 --> 00:49:35,495
not exactly that when you just did

1486
00:49:35,795 --> 00:49:37,865

1624
00:55:22,100 --> 00:55:24,710

1625
00:55:24,710 --> 00:55:26,600
hosted by two very funny british comedians

1626
00:55:26,630 --> 00:55:28,040
james yeah that was we get it

1627
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:30,380
you're an anglo file well maybe why

1628
00:55:30,380 --> 00:55:31,670
don't you just move over so

1629
00:55:31,700 --> 00:55:33,650
see do you think i am do

1630
00:55:33,650 --> 00:55:35,570
you think i am an anglophile there's

1631
00:55:35,570 --> 00:55:37,250
this like phenomenon that children start to

1632
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:38,240
speak with a british accent if they

1633
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:39,770
watch a lot of pep i've heard

1634
00:55:40,032 --> 00:55:41,360
a lot of wet peppa pig it's

1635
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:43,700
a dorsch cartoon and they get addicted

1636
00:55:43,700 --> 00:55:45,080
to it and then they start speaking

1637
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:46,730
like because that's how they're learning how

1638
00:55:46,730 --> 00:55:48,200
to speak it's interesting because i used

1639
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:49,970
to watch a lot of pbx as

1640
00:55:49,970 --> 00:55:51,260
a kid because my parents used to

1641
00:55:51,260 --> 00:55:51,830
watch oh yeah

1642
00:55:51,890 --> 00:55:55,575
tapi piggies pig this pig um but

1643
00:55:55,580 --> 00:55:56,480
that's how i would watch a lot

1644
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:58,910

the vowel substitutions in your script and

1663
00:56:31,250 --> 00:56:32,150

different vowels yeah yeah everywhere all the

1665
00:56:35,030 --> 00:56:38,420

mitts total killer waste space

1748
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:43,340
i wouldn't go that way i think

1749
00:59:43,340 --> 00:59:44,780
we saw the potential in him he

1750
00:59:44,780 --> 00:59:46,100
was not he was only talking out

1751
00:59:46,100 --> 00:59:47,090
of the gate it was like no

1752
00:59:47,090 --> 00:59:48,560
copy this needs work go back yeah

1753
00:59:48,560 --> 00:59:50,864
go backward yeah back there guy goes

whip back yeah well either jack to

1756
00:59:56,390 --> 01:00:00,230
the drawing board yeah and so then

1757
01:00:00,620 --> 01:00:01,670
he comes back because one

1758
01:00:01,790 --> 01:00:02,990
one of our notes was what's the

1759
01:00:02,990 --> 01:00:04,550

1760
01:00:04,550 --> 01:00:06,410
a big prize that you went yeah

1761
01:00:07,010 --> 01:00:08,210
then it gets back to us finally

1762
01:00:08,210 --> 01:00:10,130
last week alright here's here's his initial

1763
01:00:10,130 --> 01:00:12,770
submission ah one person is a movie

1764
01:00:12,770 --> 01:00:13,910
star doing a press junket for a

1765
01:00:13,910 --> 01:00:15,800
made-up movie one person is an interviewer

1766
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:17,720
from a random local news station and

1767
01:00:17,720 --> 01:00:19,490
the other person is the stars handler

1768
01:00:19,490 --> 01:00:21,230
trying to keep the interview on track

1769
01:00:22,580 --> 01:00:23,600
i actually think it's a good game

1770
01:00:23,810 --> 01:00:25,910
well why no we didn't it needed

1771
01:00:25,910 --> 01:00:27,200
something more because it wasn't necessarily a

01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:28,460
game for sure you know what i

1773
01:00:28,460 --> 01:00:31,490

the the there's two rumors what the

1853
01:03:15,655 --> 01:03:17,215
reporter and it comes up with a

1854
01:03:17,215 --> 01:03:20,155
rumor no and the publicist comes up

1855
01:03:20,155 --> 01:03:22,225
with a rumor oh okay both are

1856
01:03:22,225 --> 01:03:25,345
told to the actor what so the

1857
01:03:25,345 --> 01:03:27,775
reporter and the publicist are thinking it's

1858
01:03:27,775 --> 01:03:30,055
two different rumors and the reporters trying

1859
01:03:30,055 --> 01:03:31,825
to get the information about why

1860
01:03:31,825 --> 01:03:33,325
one of them but the publicist just

1861
01:03:33,325 --> 01:03:35,185
trying to stop the other one yes

1862
01:03:35,245 --> 01:03:36,745
trying to stop both yes so the

1863
01:03:36,775 --> 01:03:38,451

1864
01:03:38,455 --> 01:03:39,505
stop but don't really what you're trying

1865
01:03:39,505 --> 01:03:40,555
to do is figure out what's going

1866
01:03:40,555 --> 01:03:42,775
on okay and so the actor hole

1867
01:03:42,805 --> 01:03:44,845
has all the knowledge yeah and is

1868
01:03:44,845 --> 01:03:46,495

1875
01:03:55,165 --> 01:03:57,295
publicist you have to guess what that

1876
01:03:57,295 --> 01:03:58,675

1877
01:03:58,675 --> 01:04:00,595
