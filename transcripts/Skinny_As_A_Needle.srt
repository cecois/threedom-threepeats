you because they understand it's food that's

168
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:25,680
the thing i also wouldn't same a

169
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,160
stand there

170
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:27,780
and have a conversation it's so insane

171
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:29,730
when if i were an uber driver

172
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:30,660

maybe so maybe yeah maybe you're bored

178
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,680
but also maybe it makes you feel

179
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,940
safer and i mean maybe that's a

180
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:43,890
female perspective but i'm like maybe i'd

181
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:45,510
want to have a conversation because it

182
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:46,905
kind of makes me feel like oh

183
00:05:46,948 --> 00:05:48,600
just some normal guy he's not going

184
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:48,960
to kill me

185
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:52,320

256
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:38,400
a timer no it's the sun sun

257
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:38,820
based

258
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:42,000
i think there's so much technology solar

259
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,710
technology and then at night they they're

260
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:45,210

the sun here's how solar technology works

265
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,170
you make something that hates the sun

266
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:57,600

267
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,370
not be alive but it's eating up

268
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:00,000
all the sunlight

269
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:01,110

so shouldn't kids say their prayers first

299
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:12,570
thing in the morning it's so dire

300
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:14,310
to have have him do it right

301
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:15,398
before they go to bed like all

302
00:10:15,398 --> 00:10:16,890
i can think about is the horror

303
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:18,480
in the world you think kids can

304
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,900
comprehend the shit they can't just proud

305
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:22,830
of you have to make them do

306
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:23,730
it so they get in a state

307
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:25,800
of grace in case god takes them

308
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:27,840
oh jesus do they know

309
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:30,060
that's what they're doing before they figured

310
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:32,610
out later oh my gosh

00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:35,490
did you say prayers at night i

312
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:37,560
think maybe they were like my parents

313
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,790
were like yeah i'd do this at

314
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:40,470
one point and then i tried it

315
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:42,480
maybe once i don't know i'm not

316
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:42,870
gaming

317
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:45,300
yeah once you know what it's not

318
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:47,700
compelling just wasn't compelling to me did

319
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:48,570

like this is stupid

340
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:28,650
i'm trying to remember when i stopped

341
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:32,070

342
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:33,118
a prayed all through high school because

343
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:33,930
i was a believer all through high

344
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:37,740
school and then when i was seventeen

345
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:39,660
eighteen getting out in the world you

346
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:43,020
were seventeen going on a tumbling out

347
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:44,670

811
00:28:54,245 --> 00:28:56,054
real estate agencies the same day we

812
00:28:56,075 --> 00:28:57,635

all the time you'd get it on

824
00:29:20,405 --> 00:29:22,295
your doorstep and so we would have

825
00:29:22,295 --> 00:29:23,375
scratch paper from

826
00:29:23,765 --> 00:29:25,895

can ride around it's to me it's

848
00:30:07,805 --> 00:30:09,695
the best early to say about this

849
00:30:09,695 --> 00:30:11,765
realtor oh anyway so my my parents

850
00:30:11,765 --> 00:30:13,145
would go out and my brother who

851
00:30:13,145 --> 00:30:14,225
is only two and a half years

852
00:30:14,225 --> 00:30:16,475
older than me was tasked with babysitting

853
00:30:16,475 --> 00:30:18,425
me and this is like you know

854
00:30:18,875 --> 00:30:21,365
i'd be i'd be eight i'd be

855
00:30:21,395 --> 00:30:23,285
you know i'd be you know it

856
00:30:23,285 --> 00:30:23,855
was just like

857
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:26,540
and by themselves i sort of think

858
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:28,790
that's true but not anymore depend on

859
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:30,800
the relationship because oh yeah all the

860
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:32,810
bullying begins well you're always trying to

861
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:35,870
kill me so that was but ah

862
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:38,570
fair enough but anyway so he he

863
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:40,670
ah i don't and i shouldn't put

864
00:30:40,670 --> 00:30:41,870
it all on him because you know

865
00:30:41,870 --> 00:30:43,250
i was interested in this as well

866
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:44,240
but being killed

867
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,850
no in in in doing doing dirty

868
00:30:46,850 --> 00:30:48,920
math yes oh sure i loved a

869
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:51,500
dirty madden and so i remember i

870
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:53,120
remember we would we would we were

871
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,410
like we can't write it in the

872
00:30:54,410 --> 00:30:57,140
madlib lib book and this is we

873
00:30:57,148 --> 00:30:58,880
we get from scholastic we would get

874
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,860
the mad lives force so we can't

875
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:02,300
write it in the madlib book so

876
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:04,070
his solution was let's write it on

877
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:04,820
the realtor scr

878
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:06,050
each paper and will throw it away

879
00:31:06,050 --> 00:31:08,120
before they get home and then so

880
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:09,380
that's gonna backfire it's like you want

881
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:10,580
to hit it better in the madlib

882
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,260
exactly because they're not gonna read the

883
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:14,330
madlib book ever you ever love to

884
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:16,245
shave the first page that's had with

885
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:18,500
a pencil right that's the funniest part

886
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:21,410
in um psycho and brothers movie the

887
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,490
great big lebowski

888
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,460
where like as it because that's a

889
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:27,260
detective trick where you're like yo and

890
00:31:27,290 --> 00:31:29,240
into the scratch week so he interviews

891
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,500
some guy and the guy's like writing

892
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:31,910
something the entire time and he like

893
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:33,530
does the scratching thing is just the

894
00:31:33,530 --> 00:31:34,610
guy was drawing a guy with a

895
00:31:34,610 --> 00:31:35,180
big dick

896
00:31:36,323 --> 00:31:38,720
so to watch the movie again i

897
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:39,800
don't think i've seen the whole thing

898
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:41,000
i didn't really like it when it

899
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:41,990
came out i didn't like it when

900
00:31:41,990 --> 00:31:43,100
it came out either but i like

901
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:44,840
it now but in any case so

902
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:46,460
we rode on the scratch paper and

903
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:48,350
then we never could figure out when

904
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:50,780
my parents were getting home and so

905
00:31:50,810 --> 00:31:52,070
every once in while we'd be watching

906
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:54,980
benny hill and yeah which had boobs

while yeah crazy you know world yeah

909
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:01,820
so we would have to turn off

910
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:03,650
the tv and pretend we weren't watching

911
00:32:03,650 --> 00:32:04,790
tv and they would always go over

912
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:05,660
the tv and see if it was

913
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:07,520
hot and they were like you were

914
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,960
watching tv and then they would say

915
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,460
well were you watching and and i

916
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:13,040

00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:45,530
i guess i'll find out how they

963
00:33:45,530 --> 00:33:48,710
decided to punish people together like the

964
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:50,390
kids together like your parents were have

965
00:33:50,390 --> 00:33:52,610
the same basic belief system i guess

966
00:33:52,610 --> 00:33:54,530
that like they can't do this they

967
00:33:54,530 --> 00:33:55,880
can't do that or they had today

968
00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:57,230
discuss and like one was kind of

969
00:33:57,230 --> 00:33:58,310

970
00:33:58,310 --> 00:33:59,300
go with you on this one

971
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:01,580

974
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:07,880
i was in a play when i

975
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:08,930

00:34:08,930 --> 00:34:11,120
cursing and my mom i was kinda

977
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:12,411

be a strict disciplinarian but that in

1011
00:35:09,890 --> 00:35:12,470

i could go back to eighteen

1109
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,600

but like you have to be so

1411
00:50:51,005 --> 00:50:52,535
every single thing well what i found

1412
00:50:52,535 --> 00:50:54,155
is like anything that comes in you

1413
00:50:54,155 --> 00:50:55,944
can google it and within one second

1414
00:50:55,955 --> 00:50:57,545
it'll yes say like no this is

1415
00:50:57,545 --> 00:50:59,015
a scam you should not pay why

1416
00:50:59,045 --> 00:51:00,245
is there no law

1417
00:51:01,325 --> 00:51:03,155
it's almost like there are i think

1418
00:51:03,155 --> 00:51:05,135
there are laws how do we get

1419
00:51:05,135 --> 00:51:07,655
them we get these laws there's i

1420
00:51:07,655 --> 00:51:09,335
mean one of the things i like

1421
00:51:09,335 --> 00:51:11,945
is when you realize you can see

1422
00:51:11,945 --> 00:51:13,595
and you can spot it obviously like

1423
00:51:14,255 --> 00:51:16,385
there are certain markers like well amazon

1424
00:51:16,385 --> 00:51:18,605
is not going to text me yeah

1425
00:51:18,635 --> 00:51:21,245
yeah no shit like that um but

1426
00:51:21,245 --> 00:51:21,425
yeah

1427
00:51:21,455 --> 00:51:23,045
it's scary to think that there there's

1428
00:51:23,045 --> 00:51:25,655
gonna be something deep fakes maybe i

1429
00:51:25,655 --> 00:51:27,425
don't right yeah i don't know what

1430
00:51:27,425 --> 00:51:28,565
it will be but like at this

1431
00:51:28,565 --> 00:51:30,515
point we're one step ahead of him

1432
00:51:30,995 --> 00:51:32,435
