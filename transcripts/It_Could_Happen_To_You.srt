no but i'm just

66
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,860
i'll draw what else could you put

67
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,390
in that drawer this wasn't a stack

68
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:02,340
of ten twenty dollar bills do you

69
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:06,450
not have what you know you know

70
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:08,100
just don't tell my twenty dollar bill

71
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:09,690
whenever you ever had ten twenty dollar

72
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:11,550
bills i believe in carry cash

73
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:15,060
don't you think hey i was just

74
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:16,890
hearing somebody talk about this on something

75
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:19,020
um great start to my story but

76
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:20,640
that tree

77
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:23,970
your sources roaring cash is a is

78
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:26,506
something that men are encouraged to to

79
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:30,330
do now i feel that i kind

80
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:32,160
of ah i agree that mentioned carry

81
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,540
cash but i think everyone should carry

82
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:36,450
cash why men i mean there's i

83
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:37,710
guess they're saying it in the sense

84
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:38,813
of from what i was listening to

85
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:40,020
is like sort of an outdated thing

86
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:40,440
of like

87
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,970
when you're on a date you gotta

88
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:42,960
have cash because what if there's a

89
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,010
valet or there's a thing they don't

90
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:45,120
take a card or there's a list

91
00:03:45,121 --> 00:03:47,730
about you've gotta be prepared yeah and

92
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,422
oh i know what it was was

93
00:03:48,452 --> 00:03:50,610
on i said no gifts and um

94
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:52,590
the guy was talking about the guests

95
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:54,030
was talking about how his mom always

96
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:55,410
made him carry cash and so when

97
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:56,580
he lived on the show he gave

98
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:58,470
bridger the premise this shows you're not

99
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:00,210
supposed to bring your spring if you

100
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:00,900
give him cash

101
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:02,520
which i think is funny yeah but

102
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,200
the whole thing is were you ever

103
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,360
encouraged growing up like you better have

104
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,890
some cat you should always have twenty

105
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:09,180
you know i tried it i'm not

106
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:10,830
talking about lots of money no i

107
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,240
yeah stuff like that does come up

108
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,200
so i try to have at least

109
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,940
two thousand dollars on me oh yeah

110
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,130
let's never see me on the street

111
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:20,220
i wanna buy some art i'm a

112
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:23,340
big fan of having one hundred dollars

113
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:25,050
in your wallet if you yeah but

114
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:26,520
that also comes from

115
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:29,490
many years of having no money and

116
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:31,440
then being like i would be very

117
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,120
aware of every dollar yeah and then

118
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,680
so i once i was able to

119
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,120
have one hundred dollars i felt like

120
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:38,310
that's makes me feel like i'm like

121
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:40,620
prepared and we talked about the gym

122
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:42,840
and in santa maria that that gave

123
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:45,390
out ten dollars instead of you told

124
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:46,890
me about that oh it was the

125
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:47,760
greatest we found

126
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:50,370
one atm because sometimes you would just

127
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:52,260
have twelve dollars in your account and

128
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:54,060
you'd be like fuck i can't access

129
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,860
it because i can't put another eight

130
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:57,480
dollars in my account because i don't

131
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,280
have a dollars but i've ten dollars

132
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,480
just sitting there and i can't i

133
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:03,420
can't eat so like we found one

134
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:05,160
atm that that would give you ten

135
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,360
dollars i think it was still like

136
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,740
a two dollar charge on the eighty

137
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:09,660
sucks that would piss me yeah but

138
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:11,220
still it was good because you could

139
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:13,020
get that last ten dollars before you

140
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:15,480
got paid again um and it was

141
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:16,950
it was the greatest yeah

142
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,790
it's thrill it's a thrill anyway i

143
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:22,050
encourage everyone to carry at least five

144
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:25,050
dollars five five for one though like

145
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:26,460
what would five dollars get you out

146
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:29,010
just comforting i mean if you're going

147
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:30,690
to carry cash you need twenty twenty

148
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:32,460
yeah but if you don't have twenty

149
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:32,940
shift

150
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,480
i don't argue with that i had

151
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,920
a friend who loves you so know

152
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,030
what's gonna come up i had a

153
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:41,700
friend who loved five dollar bills yeah

154
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:44,940
sure he i love them right here

155
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:46,950
no moustache he wore this really cool

156
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:47,340
hat

157
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:51,270
he felt like that was the most

158
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:55,110
um adaptable form of conversion a lot

159
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:56,220
of stuff you know it's a great

160
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:58,620
tip so he hated when he would

161
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:01,350
get change with twenties he would always

162
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:03,480
ask for fives instead and if he

163
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:05,820
ever got that jesus if he ever

164
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,710
got fives instead of a twenty of

165
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:08,640
like someone were to go

166
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:11,070
give him fives he would always brag

167
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:12,180
about it he would come and go

168
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:13,080
guess what happened to me at the

169
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,760
bank today and he would brag about

170
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:15,780
and then he would open up his

171
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:16,710
wife thought i was gonna be like

172
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:17,910
then he would give the person five

173
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:20,850
dollars no no he just loved having

174
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:22,830
other problems did he have and then

175
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:26,250
he ah was what was what was

176
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:27,300
this eventual diagnosis

177
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,820
then he would open up his wallet

178
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:31,080
and show it to me sometimes and

179
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,970
there would be like ten fives in

180
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:34,320
there and he'd go i'm packing

181
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,000

i remember it where the rumor got

332
00:11:51,265 --> 00:11:54,145
around that banks were going to stop

333
00:11:54,145 --> 00:11:56,185
giving out cash that banks were gonna

334
00:11:56,185 --> 00:11:58,225
run out of money ah and so

335
00:11:58,225 --> 00:12:00,505

i only have so much the only

372
00:13:13,675 --> 00:13:15,025
have so much in the bank right

373
00:13:15,055 --> 00:13:16,645
so why do you know where you're

374
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:18,355
going to be using cash because they

375
00:13:18,355 --> 00:13:19,881
were saying that things were going to

376
00:13:19,881 --> 00:13:22,015
get so bad with the pandemic that

377
00:13:22,615 --> 00:13:25,855
no one would accept credit cards or

378
00:13:25,885 --> 00:13:27,835
checks or whatever like cash was going

379
00:13:27,835 --> 00:13:29,455
to be the only currency so the

380
00:13:29,485 --> 00:13:30,505
banks are saying

381
00:13:30,595 --> 00:13:31,825
we're not going to issue we're not

382
00:13:31,825 --> 00:13:34,075
going to issue cash because it's a

383
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:36,055
it's a it's a a touch thing

384
00:13:36,295 --> 00:13:37,735
because it's a thing that you touch

385
00:13:37,765 --> 00:13:39,505
no no no the banks they don't

386
00:13:39,505 --> 00:13:41,365
have the rumor was because they don't

387
00:13:41,365 --> 00:13:43,375
have everyone was you won't be able

388
00:13:43,375 --> 00:13:44,335
to use a credit card anymore you'll

389
00:13:44,335 --> 00:13:45,475
have to use cash everywhere at the

390
00:13:45,475 --> 00:13:46,945
bank goes we don't really have that

391
00:13:46,945 --> 00:13:47,905
much cash and i was like did

392
00:13:47,905 --> 00:13:49,375
i get online before everyone else can

393
00:13:49,405 --> 00:13:50,575
get scared much dancing

394
00:13:51,115 --> 00:13:53,695
okay so it starts with the story

395
00:13:53,695 --> 00:13:56,005
starts with we think down the line

396
00:13:56,245 --> 00:13:58,135
you're gonna need to have cash because

397
00:13:59,185 --> 00:14:02,095
the economic the economics of america are

398
00:14:02,095 --> 00:14:04,135
going to collect right right so at

399
00:14:04,135 --> 00:14:05,395
a certain point the pandemic is gonna

400
00:14:05,408 --> 00:14:06,925
get that bad but you better get

401
00:14:06,925 --> 00:14:08,695
cash now because the banks aren't getting

402
00:14:08,695 --> 00:14:09,685
when i get out of this i

403
00:14:09,685 --> 00:14:11,485
gotta know it sounded i guess i

404
00:14:11,485 --> 00:14:12,685
was confused because it sounded like it

405
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:14,485
started with the banks are gonna stop

406
00:14:14,485 --> 00:14:17,365
giving cash right right right um but

407
00:14:17,455 --> 00:14:19,315
also like we were

408
00:14:19,345 --> 00:14:22,885
we're practically cashless now like why would

409
00:14:23,185 --> 00:14:25,645
it i don't understand how that the

410
00:14:25,645 --> 00:14:28,735
pandemic would affect what it was i

411
00:14:28,735 --> 00:14:31,015
mean when it first started we went

412
00:14:31,015 --> 00:14:33,985
to the the the the mayfair or

413
00:14:33,985 --> 00:14:37,435
whatever it's called gal yeltsin's and nothing

414
00:14:37,435 --> 00:14:39,415
was called mayfair it was called mayfair

415
00:14:39,475 --> 00:14:40,375
for a long time the one i

416
00:14:40,375 --> 00:14:42,565
used tb but i just shouldn't have

00:14:42,565 --> 00:14:43,945
where you've only known it as girls

418
00:14:43,975 --> 00:14:45,985
but i want to get hyper specific

419
00:14:45,985 --> 00:14:47,215
i want to where your brain just

420
00:14:47,215 --> 00:14:48,445
went to in the past that you

421
00:14:48,445 --> 00:14:50,245
just called it mayfair it was called

422
00:14:50,245 --> 00:14:51,805
that one that that specific one i

423
00:14:51,805 --> 00:14:53,786
called mayfair for the longest it it

424
00:14:53,815 --> 00:14:55,795

425
00:14:55,795 --> 00:14:57,265

not believe how

479
00:17:02,035 --> 00:17:04,495
just sad it was yeah there were

480
00:17:04,495 --> 00:17:06,205
a couple like kind of ones they

481
00:17:06,205 --> 00:17:07,795
put real effort into but most of

482
00:17:07,795 --> 00:17:09,565
it was just like this is jenny

483
00:17:09,565 --> 00:17:11,605
go hey hey man you had since

484
00:17:11,605 --> 00:17:12,925
march to figure out what you're going

485
00:17:12,925 --> 00:17:13,915
to do for christmas i don't know

486
00:17:13,915 --> 00:17:14,965
if you really thought you'd be open

487
00:17:14,965 --> 00:17:16,825
by then you should have seemed like

488
00:17:16,825 --> 00:17:18,625
an act of desperation on their part

489
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:20,935
they're like we need five dollars i'm

490
00:17:20,935 --> 00:17:22,135
gonna say election

491
00:17:22,195 --> 00:17:24,715
like july they should have been thinking

492
00:17:24,963 --> 00:17:25,855
this is what we're gonna do what

493
00:17:25,885 --> 00:17:26,935
because it is a big park but

494
00:17:26,935 --> 00:17:28,285
they had you on a very specific

495
00:17:28,285 --> 00:17:30,385
path i know going all over the

496
00:17:30,445 --> 00:17:32,545
world how i felt about it there

497
00:17:32,605 --> 00:17:34,135
they figured on your head i want

498
00:17:34,165 --> 00:17:35,665
i want your feelings about carrying a

499
00:17:35,665 --> 00:17:38,485
car just because you're gonna car i

500
00:17:38,485 --> 00:17:40,255
felt like they figured out a route

501
00:17:40,255 --> 00:17:42,355
that would work for cars first

502
00:17:42,715 --> 00:17:43,945
and it was the only route that

503
00:17:43,945 --> 00:17:46,225
would work they couldn't shorten it and

504
00:17:46,225 --> 00:17:47,275
then they were like fuck this is

505
00:17:47,275 --> 00:17:49,915
too big we can't can't dilate we

506
00:17:49,915 --> 00:17:52,045
can't fill it well we'll do what

507
00:17:52,045 --> 00:17:53,455
we can and so certain it was

508
00:17:53,455 --> 00:17:55,495
patchy certain parts of it were kind

509
00:17:55,495 --> 00:17:57,565
of impressive but as a whole it's

510
00:17:57,565 --> 00:17:59,035
like if you're going if you're traveling

511
00:17:59,035 --> 00:18:00,835
that whole route you want shit the

512
00:18:00,835 --> 00:18:02,425
whole time let me tell you that

513
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:03,955
let me tell you if that's if

514
00:18:03,955 --> 00:18:05,875
that's what happened they should put we

515
00:18:05,875 --> 00:18:07,585
did what we could on the ticket

516
00:18:09,805 --> 00:18:11,635
yeah as a mountain we did what

517
00:18:11,635 --> 00:18:13,165
we could i saw a handful of

518
00:18:13,165 --> 00:18:14,575
those things on people's instagram like there

519
00:18:14,575 --> 00:18:17,305
was one of people driving through umm

520
00:18:17,335 --> 00:18:19,645
i'd sort of jurassic park like dinosaur

521
00:18:19,645 --> 00:18:22,195
thing at one of those places and

522
00:18:22,195 --> 00:18:23,845
so they had these like animatronic dinosaurs

523
00:18:23,845 --> 00:18:26,395
but it just looked like really not

524
00:18:26,395 --> 00:18:27,925
exciting especially because it was open during

525
00:18:27,925 --> 00:18:28,915
the day as well as the

526
00:18:28,915 --> 00:18:30,775
night and the person i saw was

527
00:18:30,775 --> 00:18:31,673
going through it during the day but

528
00:18:31,673 --> 00:18:33,055
you have to understand this is just

529
00:18:33,055 --> 00:18:35,335
wrong this is twenty twenty we had

530
00:18:35,335 --> 00:18:37,315
nothing to do back then and we

531
00:18:37,315 --> 00:18:39,625
were happy for it i don't think

532
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:41,095
that's like chris harrison being like it

533
00:18:41,095 --> 00:18:43,315
was twenty eighteen and to think things

534
00:18:43,322 --> 00:18:45,909
change what happened to him oh no

535
00:18:45,966 --> 00:18:49,075
vaccines go he's all right what

536
00:18:49,075 --> 00:18:50,995
it went raw i could tell you

537
00:18:51,385 --> 00:18:54,625
so he what happened was our reality

538
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:57,205
recap yeah actually yeah which we never

539
00:18:57,205 --> 00:18:58,435
sorry it took so long to get

540
00:18:58,435 --> 00:19:00,985
to it okay we usually do it

541
00:19:00,985 --> 00:19:03,865
impulse really bored josh insert the jingle

542
00:19:04,855 --> 00:19:08,635
reality recap yeah alright take that and

543
00:19:08,635 --> 00:19:09,115
remix it

544
00:19:09,235 --> 00:19:09,535
anyone

545
00:19:11,965 --> 00:19:14,545
um so what happened was there was

546
00:19:14,545 --> 00:19:18,145
ah bachelor recently matt james who is

547
00:19:18,145 --> 00:19:21,085
a black man he was dating many

548
00:19:21,085 --> 00:19:22,705
women as they do on the bachelor

549
00:19:22,795 --> 00:19:24,445
narrowed it down guys doing the bachelor

550
00:19:24,535 --> 00:19:27,925
narrowed it down to two women um

551
00:19:28,465 --> 00:19:30,385
now as we know from understanding the

552
00:19:30,385 --> 00:19:30,835
time links

553
00:19:30,835 --> 00:19:32,035
this came out before we knew who

554
00:19:32,035 --> 00:19:32,935
was gonna make it to the final

555
00:19:32,935 --> 00:19:35,305
two there was a woman rachel who

556
00:19:35,845 --> 00:19:37,585
was pictures of her came out that

557
00:19:37,585 --> 00:19:39,715
she attended an antebellum party and develop

558
00:19:39,715 --> 00:19:42,985
themed party dressed as sort of a

559
00:19:43,045 --> 00:19:45,895
in the period then bad southern belle

560
00:19:45,895 --> 00:19:48,115
but like slave owner yeah the fashion

561
00:19:48,115 --> 00:19:50,545
yes and i never heard of this

562
00:19:50,605 --> 00:19:50,995
party

563
00:19:51,145 --> 00:19:51,983
i don't know what this is i

564
00:19:51,983 --> 00:19:54,115
never heard of this party but it's

565
00:19:54,115 --> 00:19:56,061
kind of important to me to pose

566
00:19:56,061 --> 00:19:57,265
but i've never even heard of this

567
00:19:57,265 --> 00:19:59,845

bottom two but we started you know

570
00:20:01,645 --> 00:20:02,965
i think the fans start to assume

571
00:20:02,965 --> 00:20:04,825
rachel's going towards the end because it's

572
00:20:04,825 --> 00:20:06,925
becoming a huge deal that this happened

573
00:20:07,435 --> 00:20:10,495
and rachel lindsay who is an ex

574
00:20:10,855 --> 00:20:11,155

594
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,460
about fifty million people do that i've

595
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:51,290
never even heard of millions of dollars

596
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:53,210
in thai but there are where are

597
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:55,730
you getting this number it is i

598
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:58,790
there's no way that numbers saying but

599
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:00,770
it is like still a popular thing

600
00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:02,120
in the south and it bums me

601
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:02,720
out yeah

602
00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:04,520
you know because i like stopped i

603
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,330
feel like this brought a lot of

604
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:06,926
light to it i didn't really know

605
00:21:06,926 --> 00:21:09,200
but it's interesting because i think growing

606
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,000
up like it's insane to me that

607
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:14,300
the dukes of hazzard had the confederate

608
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:15,980
flag yeah car and and i think

609
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:19,232
as a kid like okay so i

610
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:22,220
basically didn't even really i'd heard of

611
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:22,850
slaves

612
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,250
until i was and so i knew

613
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:26,420
that slavery was a thing and it

614
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:27,530
was bad but i didn't really know

615
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,180
until i was what until i was

616
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:30,950
twelve and oh okay and my history

617
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:32,480
teacher showed us roots and then it

618
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,340
was like oh fuck did that really

619
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:36,620
happen though okay so like sud for

620
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:38,480
a little kid but suddenly i'm i'm

621
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,420
seeing that but it's like the confederate

622
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:43,040
flag growing up

623
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,420
if it just meant the south to

624
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:46,670
me you know do yeah absolutely i

625
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:48,650
didn't have it didn't have any connotation

626
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:50,030
to me other than that because i

627
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:52,190
didn't understand the civil war yeah you

628
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:54,620
know so and i think i think

629
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:56,600
things like the antebellum party and the

630
00:21:56,630 --> 00:21:58,550
and and the confederate flag have just

631
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:00,050
like been programmed in us to be

632
00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:02,623
fine ever since we were kids and

633
00:22:02,623 --> 00:22:03,200
not understand

634
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,550
ending it so it's like a blind

635
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:07,310
spot for people yeah people let it

636
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:09,530
go for so long and it was

637
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:11,570
just like a cool design yeah just

638
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:13,790
for the record rachel did release a

639
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:15,110
statement which was like a pretty good

640
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:17,210
apology i thought but then on the

641
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:19,490
after the final rose she had to

642
00:22:19,730 --> 00:22:21,380
sit with matt and they'd broken up

643
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:23,360
shits she won she was chosen at

644
00:22:23,390 --> 00:22:24,860
the end wow she was the chosen

645
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:27,020

646
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:28,730

cast to and advance from this season

684
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:48,710
by the way i feel like they

685
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:50,450
cast the white girl and then they

686
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:50,720
were like

687
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:53,000
oh shit all this went dancing exactly

688
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,529
what i thought it seemed like but

689
00:23:54,529 --> 00:23:55,820

693
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:03,950
like i feel like yes the system

694
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:05,510
is fucked up that it's six weeks

695
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:06,650
or you know however long and then

00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:08,150
they have to get engaged but you

697
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:09,230
know that's what it is going in

698
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,877
so everyone should be everyone should

699
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,440
be primed as a fucking pump to

700
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,750
get engaged yeah like everyone should be

701
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:16,070
at the end of their she was

702
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:17,300
ready and that's what kind of killed

703
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:20,630
me proceed he was a perfect ah

704
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:22,850
she's ready person for the show she

705
00:24:22,850 --> 00:24:27,230
was like totally mannish suis teacher nice

706
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:30,172
normal seemed ready for marriage yeah she

707
00:24:30,172 --> 00:24:31,040
let rachel

708
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:34,220
was the younger immature dumb shit who's

709
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:35,900
like obviously going to date around and

710
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:37,940
have twenty more boyfriends we share and

711
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,130
share the real one the wing racist

712
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:43,340
i'd like to yeah i just couldn't

713
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:44,870
but anyway so they cast these two

714
00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:46,700
girls to be the next two bachelorettes

715
00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:47,780
but then there's gonna be a bachelor

716
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:49,010
between them so it was like that's

717
00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:50,540
why it seemed like yes this is

718
00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:51,200
redemption

719
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:53,810
why that's my fantasy to bachelor that's

720
00:24:53,810 --> 00:24:55,460
an ambassador between that's why it seemed

721
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:57,050
like it was a sort of like

722
00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:58,970
trying to fix something because they don't

723
00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:01,670
usually announce them multiple seasons in advance

724
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:04,190
right how about this this is my

725
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:06,020
this is my re still in reality

726
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,360
so to recap and this is me

727
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:11,060
it should ah that the bachelors should

728
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:13,730
not be about getting married but it

729
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:17,270
should be about having sex yeah and

730
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:20,150
so try a sexist that's what happens

731
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:21,980
because then you're not putting pressure on

732
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:24,590
somebody to getting gauged but it's like

733
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:26,540
now we're going to have said yes

734
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:28,190
finally i pick one person to have

735
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:28,790
sex yes

736
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,460
x that's going went on i got

737
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:32,900
it i want to know more about

738
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:36,140

about ninety days yeah i would like

747
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:53,030
to just say one thing about it

748
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:55,220
okay it's a great show one sense

749
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:57,800
oh wow it's it's a couples that

750
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,840
have now they get they meet at

751
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,880
the altar they've never met they are

752
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:04,640
paired up by matchmakers and psychologists and

753
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,110
they walked on the island our wedding

754
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:07,730
day to meet the person that they

755
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:08,750
are married to and they have eight

756
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:09,110
weeks

757
00:26:09,290 --> 00:26:10,700
where they're married and then at the

758
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:11,444
end they decide if they want to

759
00:26:11,444 --> 00:26:13,062
get divorced or stay together can be

760
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:15,860
an enrollment um it's probably technically an

761
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:17,330
enrollment because it's only eight weeks so

762
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:19,370
i'd rather be in no i want

763
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:20,185
it for them to be in an

764
00:26:20,185 --> 00:26:21,800
element too because sometimes it goes so

765
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,600
fucking awry that it's like socks if

766
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,370
that's like considered your first light i'm

767
00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:27,980
not a huge well i think it

768
00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:29,030
depends on where you are in your

769
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:29,300
life

770
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,010
but i think some people can be

771
00:26:31,010 --> 00:26:33,410
like i knew within the first couple

772
00:26:33,410 --> 00:26:34,610
of weeks and we got married three

773
00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:36,050
months and i think that's okay sometimes

774
00:26:36,050 --> 00:26:37,520
especially if like both of the people

775
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,530
yeah or in the at at the

776
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:40,700
time of their life where they're just

777
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:43,640

778
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:47,810

surprise venmo

1107
00:38:10,275 --> 00:38:11,595
but but the recipes used to be

1108
00:38:11,595 --> 00:38:13,545
about okay there are these huge movie

1109
00:38:13,545 --> 00:38:15,045
stars and they would make a mistake

1110
00:38:15,045 --> 00:38:17,715
like halle berry in catwoman and that's

1111
00:38:17,835 --> 00:38:19,485
even better yeah and they would have

1112
00:38:19,485 --> 00:38:21,580
a sense of humor about it oh

1113
00:38:21,585 --> 00:38:23,565
yeah because very showed up to accept

1114
00:38:23,565 --> 00:38:24,915
it the day before she got an

1115
00:38:24,915 --> 00:38:27,255
oscar or whatever and glenn in my

1116
00:38:27,285 --> 00:38:30,015
in my category or my year whatever

1117
00:38:30,105 --> 00:38:31,515
glenn closest nominee for an oscar for

1118
00:38:31,515 --> 00:38:32,595
the same role she's nominated for a

1119
00:38:32,595 --> 00:38:34,665
razzie and right anna hathaway or some

1120
00:38:34,695 --> 00:38:36,285
or somebody else right but but it's

1121
00:38:36,285 --> 00:38:37,845
just when it's just a when it's

1122
00:38:37,845 --> 00:38:39,915
someone who's on who's like trying to

1123
00:38:39,915 --> 00:38:41,625
make a name for themselves and is

1124
00:38:42,075 --> 00:38:45,465
arguably the best part of the thing

1125
00:38:45,465 --> 00:38:48,195
that they are i said arguably yeah

1126
00:38:48,315 --> 00:38:49,455
and i'm the one who's gonna argue

1127
00:38:52,995 --> 00:38:55,575
it seems weird to to call that

1128
00:38:55,575 --> 00:38:56,955
out and it seems like the razzies

1129
00:38:56,955 --> 00:38:58,215
have taken a turn over the last

1130
00:38:58,215 --> 00:39:00,015
few years into just being like mean

1131
00:39:00,015 --> 00:39:01,845
asshole things like that they're meaningless now

1132
00:39:02,565 --> 00:39:04,365
it's like this doesn't have an identity

1133
00:39:04,395 --> 00:39:05,985
it's just it's just a negative thing

1134
00:39:05,985 --> 00:39:07,275
what i thought was could have been

1135
00:39:07,275 --> 00:39:09,885
funds you know yeah it's reported on

1136
00:39:09,885 --> 00:39:10,335
by like

1137
00:39:10,335 --> 00:39:13,695
the actual like deadline oh yes ny

1138
00:39:13,755 --> 00:39:16,248
not even you even regardless of myself

1139
00:39:16,248 --> 00:39:17,805
being included i was like i don't

1140
00:39:17,805 --> 00:39:19,335
understand why you would post this this

1141
00:39:19,335 --> 00:39:21,345
has nothing to do with like actual

1142
00:39:21,345 --> 00:39:23,955
anything it's really just mean and it's

1143
00:39:23,955 --> 00:39:25,875
mean even if you are anne hathaway

1144
00:39:25,875 --> 00:39:27,495
i'm like i think that's mean i

1145
00:39:27,495 --> 00:39:29,415
don't yeah i don't so for me

1146
00:39:29,415 --> 00:39:30,495
i was like it made me feel

1147
00:39:30,538 --> 00:39:31,785
about but then i was like who

1148
00:39:31,785 --> 00:39:33,372
cares whatever and then part of me

1149
00:39:33,377 --> 00:39:34,335
was like well i'm gonna list all

1150
00:39:34,335 --> 00:39:36,195
these fucking famous people yeah i mean

1151
00:39:36,195 --> 00:39:37,665
in a way it's like they they

1152
00:39:37,665 --> 00:39:39,675
deem your work serious yeah i mean

1153
00:39:39,795 --> 00:39:41,685
if there's that but like i also

1154
00:39:41,685 --> 00:39:43,335
thought they nominated a child from the

1155
00:39:43,335 --> 00:39:44,745
movie music and i was like yeah

1156
00:39:45,675 --> 00:39:48,135
like it's just that's not her fault

1157
00:39:48,135 --> 00:39:50,175
that that movie is not appropriate like

1158
00:39:50,445 --> 00:39:50,625
i

1159
00:39:50,655 --> 00:39:52,245
just thought the whole thing and i

1160
00:39:52,245 --> 00:39:53,355
looked up look where it started and

1161
00:39:53,355 --> 00:39:55,695
it was like some publicist started in

1162
00:39:55,695 --> 00:39:56,595
his living room and i was like

1163
00:39:56,745 --> 00:39:58,125
okay so some publicist wanted to be

1164
00:39:58,125 --> 00:39:59,565
a dick making fun of celebrities and

1165
00:39:59,565 --> 00:40:01,095
his living room and now we have

1166
00:40:01,095 --> 00:40:03,075
the internet where like you have to

1167
00:40:03,075 --> 00:40:04,845
read about that yeah and like share

1168
00:40:04,845 --> 00:40:06,495
it like it's me or the people

1169
00:40:06,495 --> 00:40:09,375
what humor in it well i also

1170
00:40:09,375 --> 00:40:10,275
think like what is the

1171
00:40:10,845 --> 00:40:12,525
all of these places that give out

1172
00:40:12,525 --> 00:40:16,485

1173
00:40:16,515 --> 00:40:18,555
like the golden globes and all this

1174
00:40:18,855 --> 00:40:21,645
they're they're the award show is an

1175
00:40:21,675 --> 00:40:24,495

you can't say the lord is not

1253
00:42:50,550 --> 00:42:52,230
funny this movie but also the thing

1254
00:42:52,230 --> 00:42:53,760
about the razzies to me is that

1255
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,110
i can't believe it's still a thing

1256
00:42:55,110 --> 00:42:56,760
it feels like a very specific kind

1257
00:42:56,760 --> 00:43:00,107
of like old-timey snark that's bad that

1258
00:43:00,140 --> 00:43:01,770
people aren't doing any of that people

1259
00:43:01,770 --> 00:43:04,440
now but also has become so terrible

1260
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:05,130
on the internet

1261
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:07,650
that it's not fun anymore you know

1262
00:43:07,650 --> 00:43:09,780
like back yes back when it first

1263
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:11,040
was around there was stuff like the

1264
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:12,570
golden globes that people were paying to

1265
00:43:12,570 --> 00:43:14,730
get nominations for and it was like

1266
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:17,010
hey let's bring hollywood down a little

1267
00:43:17,010 --> 00:43:18,750
bit yeah and i'd say something funny

1268
00:43:18,750 --> 00:43:20,040
to that when there's no law but

1269
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:22,890
nowadays it's like look we're just faced

1270
00:43:22,890 --> 00:43:24,270
with it all day long the people

1271
00:43:24,270 --> 00:43:25,791
saying you suck you suck yeah

1272
00:43:26,190 --> 00:43:28,050
so i think they've outgrown their usefulness

1273
00:43:28,050 --> 00:43:29,340
and i did see a lot of

1274
00:43:29,430 --> 00:43:31,860
um people tweeting like what this like

1275
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:33,420
okay it's a pandemic and you still

1276
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:34,950
did the razzies you just feels like

1277
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:36,300
really like

1278
00:43:37,389 --> 00:43:39,690
not going to make it just leave

1282
00:43:46,530 --> 00:43:48,720
you were nominated i was like i

1283
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:50,640
wouldn't have even expected this like in

1284
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:52,350
the same way know that when between

1285
00:43:52,350 --> 00:43:54,720
two ferns came out when the razzie

1286
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:57,030
nominations were coming out i i did

1287
00:43:57,030 --> 00:43:57,510
not have awh

1288
00:43:57,510 --> 00:43:59,070
awareness of it because i did not

1289
00:43:59,070 --> 00:44:01,149
expect it would be nominated on reddit

1290
00:44:01,290 --> 00:44:02,550
no it didn't i didn't but i

1291
00:44:02,550 --> 00:44:03,600
but that's what i mean is i

1292
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:05,340
was like look you know say what

1293
00:44:05,340 --> 00:44:07,380
you will about it people enjoyed it

1294
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:08,400
for the most part you know in

1295
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:09,270
a lot of people watched it and

1296
00:44:09,270 --> 00:44:10,260
it was like okay great

1297
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:12,450
so i never even thought like it

1298
00:44:12,450 --> 00:44:14,160
was a possibility i wasn't sitting there

1299
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:17,040
like you know for the razzie announcements

1300
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:18,180
going like oh i hope we don't

1301
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:20,250
get one so that's why i was

1302
00:44:20,490 --> 00:44:21,660
mad as a cast member of the

1303
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:24,150
film yeah i remember being very invested

1304
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:26,010
and saying god of the razzies leave

1305
00:44:26,010 --> 00:44:28,650
us alone but i you know i

1306
00:44:28,650 --> 00:44:30,930
feel like to to not let myself

1307
00:44:30,990 --> 00:44:31,110
go

1308
00:44:31,110 --> 00:44:33,090
go to a bad place about it

1309
00:44:33,090 --> 00:44:35,850
it's like whoa okay i got to

1310
00:44:35,850 --> 00:44:37,920
be in a movie that was tech

1311
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:40,260
one of the most watched movies of

00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:44,100
the year modesto sixty million views yes

1315
00:44:47,370 --> 00:44:48,780

00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:54,750
yeah i feel like a yeah it's

1319
00:44:54,750 --> 00:44:56,460
it's just like i think people don't

1320
00:44:56,550 --> 00:44:58,770
associate anything with like real people when

1321
00:44:58,770 --> 00:44:59,790
they do something like that where it's

1322
00:44:59,790 --> 00:45:01,770
like i have to talk myself out

1323
00:45:01,770 --> 00:45:03,720
of a hole because that like with

1324
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:05,400
like facts and figure i'd like to

1325
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:07,710
talk myself into a hole like the

1326
00:45:07,710 --> 00:45:11,010
bachelor is a bachelor matt anyway he's

1327
00:45:11,010 --> 00:45:11,430
christian

1328
00:45:11,430 --> 00:45:12,810
ian i don't even know if he

1329
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:14,730
back to reality recap i don't know

1330
00:45:14,730 --> 00:45:16,770
if even bedded any of these women

1331
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:20,070

1332
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:22,170

1333
00:45:22,170 --> 00:45:23,700
them seem pretty happy the next day

1334
00:45:25,590 --> 00:45:27,960
someone if anyone smile i think you

1335
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:30,270
must assume that they are having sex

1336
00:45:30,540 --> 00:45:32,400
and that we are meant to infer

1337
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:34,620
that you know the bachelor did a

1338
00:45:34,650 --> 00:45:36,540
did a left turn from we're not

1339
00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:38,580
even going to intimate this is in

1340
00:45:38,580 --> 00:45:39,900
the early seasons we're not even going

1341
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:43,530

00:45:57,570 --> 00:45:59,280
for the bachelor franchise to then like

1350
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:01,590
just admit that the bachelor were having

1351
00:46:01,590 --> 00:46:04,170
sex with every single contestant who gets

1352
00:46:04,170 --> 00:46:05,130

00:47:46,590 --> 00:47:48,060
my friend christine woods and that was

1400
00:47:48,060 --> 00:47:48,600
awkward

1401
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:52,800
tap dance teacher my friend natasha lucero

1402
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:55,680
and that was awkward that's weird and

1403
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:57,450
you wrote all of these right yeah

1404
00:47:57,450 --> 00:47:58,830
but then you begged them to but

1405
00:47:58,830 --> 00:48:00,300
but no when you're a writer on

1406
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:02,250
why these things you refuse to cast

1407
00:48:02,250 --> 00:48:04,050
anyone else when you're riding on one

1408
00:48:04,050 --> 00:48:05,730
of these things you're thinking conceptually about

1409
00:48:05,730 --> 00:48:06,660
it and then it comes to the

1410
00:48:06,660 --> 00:48:07,710
day where you're supposed to do and

1411
00:48:07,710 --> 00:48:09,630
you're like fuck fuck i guess i

1412
00:48:09,639 --> 00:48:09,960
better be

1413
00:48:09,990 --> 00:48:11,010
the actor in this

1414
00:48:12,540 --> 00:48:14,790
we should fire that guy i don't

1415
00:48:14,790 --> 00:48:17,220
want my friend because a stranger is

1416
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:18,300
my own show

1417
00:48:20,550 --> 00:48:22,830
oh i'm gonna suddenly guess what else

1418
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:27,360
um and then what's her name abigail

1419
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:30,630
spencer from umm we did the hotdog

1420
00:48:30,630 --> 00:48:32,790
kiss which was disgusting where we each

1421
00:48:33,150 --> 00:48:34,350
ate one end of a hot dog

1422
00:48:34,350 --> 00:48:35,340
and then met in the middle and

1423
00:48:35,340 --> 00:48:37,530
kissing it was so fucking gross

1424
00:48:38,940 --> 00:48:41,070
but yeah it is i was actually

1425
00:48:41,070 --> 00:48:42,840
proud when we did the ferns movie

1426
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:44,250
that we didn't put a romantic so

1427
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:45,990
i was thrown and the movie was

1428
00:48:46,290 --> 00:48:48,420
because i was like why does this

1429
00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:50,100
have to be first of all even

1430
00:48:50,130 --> 00:48:51,420
giovanni and ryan have domingo i was

1431
00:48:51,420 --> 00:48:52,680
going i'm so glad i want to

1432
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:54,600
fuck oh my and we cut that

1433
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:56,040
subplot i know they make for no

1434
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:58,230
reason yeah but you know even worse

1435
00:48:58,260 --> 00:48:59,040
some of the food

1436
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:02,130
no i was correct ok i hate

1437
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:03,870
having to do i mean everyone does

1438
00:49:03,870 --> 00:49:05,070
it's like well i also think like

1439
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:06,150
it's weird you and zach had a

1440
00:49:06,150 --> 00:49:08,160
mentor relationship and why no it would

1441
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:09,660
have been weird to make it so

1442
00:49:09,690 --> 00:49:10,770
i thought it was much sweeter ho

1443
00:49:10,770 --> 00:49:12,810
was yeah exactly like he just was

1444
00:49:12,810 --> 00:49:14,460
your friend you know and yeah yeah

1445
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:17,730
normal yes that's normal can i say

1446
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:20,040
that not only does that not

1447
00:49:20,070 --> 00:49:21,810
have to be a subplot in most

1448
00:49:21,810 --> 00:49:24,180
things yeah like an action movies and

1449
00:49:24,180 --> 00:49:26,730
whatever you don't you don't need it

1450
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:28,440
you don't need sexual tension doesn't add

1451
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:30,990
anything and it's also it's it's usually

1452
00:49:30,990 --> 00:49:33,240
done so poorly that it just comes

1453
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:34,434
out of nowhere like at the end

1454
00:49:34,445 --> 00:49:36,330
these people hook up and it's like

1455
00:49:36,330 --> 00:49:38,970
why wow yeah there shouldn't be romance

1456
00:49:38,970 --> 00:49:40,200
in anything in

1457
00:49:40,230 --> 00:49:43,110
any stadium well because my ears or

1458
00:49:43,140 --> 00:49:44,280
other my friend know but here's how

1459
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:46,020
i feel the stakes and movies like

1460
00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:47,520
i watched the snyder cut of justice

1461
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:48,990
league last night oh that's on you

1462
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:51,300

made he made his basically what happened

1478
00:50:17,370 --> 00:50:19,200

the studio and they didn't like it

1483
00:50:26,310 --> 00:50:28,200
and so they hired just weeden to

1484
00:50:28,230 --> 00:50:29,730
come in and rewrite and reshoot the

1485
00:50:29,730 --> 00:50:31,500
entire thing so it's like a very

1486
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:33,390
different and okay i didn't even understand

1487
00:50:33,390 --> 00:50:35,490
that just sweden but and and the

1488
00:50:35,490 --> 00:50:37,380
sad part of it is is he

00:50:37,620 --> 00:50:40,110
his daughter committed suicide so real life

1490
00:50:40,170 --> 00:50:40,710

so high of like the entire world

1501
00:50:59,550 --> 00:51:00,870
is going to die and then

1502
00:51:01,530 --> 00:51:03,030
a romantic comedy is like when two

1503
00:51:03,030 --> 00:51:05,550

just be confirmed he is or dramas

1508
00:51:15,450 --> 00:51:17,550
or actions and there should be no

1509
00:51:17,550 --> 00:51:19,530
roman no romance because the stakes are

1510
00:51:19,530 --> 00:51:21,180

1511
00:51:21,180 --> 00:51:21,660

00:51:46,260 --> 00:51:48,060
by the way instead of skills like

1524
00:51:48,150 --> 00:51:50,880
four hours long right yeah um here's

1525
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:52,440

00:51:52,470 --> 00:51:56,100
taken out taken out of um specifically

1527
00:51:56,100 --> 00:51:59,580
police dramas is the sirens

1528
00:51:59,580 --> 00:52:01,108

on hbo max and it's

1537
00:52:19,740 --> 00:52:23,040
great it's like a real slow procedural

1538
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:24,480
thing that's based on a true story

1539
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:28,890
true story okay they're trying chez that's

1540
00:52:28,890 --> 00:52:31,620
from present exhibits no it's not a

1541
00:52:31,620 --> 00:52:34,110
gibby that's john from real-world guys

1542
00:52:35,460 --> 00:52:38,130
why talk to reality we can't be

1543
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:40,230
done with the real world you know

1544
00:52:40,230 --> 00:52:41,880
i'm you know how in this where's

1545
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:43,650
the drama dings now an episode of

1546
00:52:43,650 --> 00:52:45,330
real world they they always start by

1547
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:48,360
this is the the story and then

1548
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:50,700
someone says true story but he sings

1549
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:52,499
it in one episode in season he

1550
00:52:52,499 --> 00:52:55,353
goes true story and if you see

1551
00:52:55,353 --> 00:52:55,500
the

1552
00:52:55,530 --> 00:52:57,600
country singer oh sure sure my friend

1553
00:52:57,600 --> 00:53:00,420
mariah smith's podcast called spectacle h episode

1554
00:53:00,420 --> 00:53:02,430
is all about the genesis of reality

1555
00:53:02,430 --> 00:53:03,480
tv it's vegan

1556
00:53:04,830 --> 00:53:07,230
so back to back to cops so

1557
00:53:07,233 --> 00:53:11,040
the entire the investigation this guy is

1558
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:15,330
investigating the death of this young journalist

1559
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:19,860
female journalist who has been decapitated and

1560
00:53:19,860 --> 00:53:22,380
dismembered at sea her body parts are

1561
00:53:22,380 --> 00:53:24,030
dropped into the ocean they have to

1562
00:53:24,030 --> 00:53:24,780
recover in all

1563
00:53:24,780 --> 00:53:26,220
order to have a base did they

1564
00:53:26,220 --> 00:53:28,470
decapitate and dismember at sea or they

1565
00:53:28,470 --> 00:53:29,670
did it on the land and then

1566
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:31,980
they'd all happen to see it everything

1567
00:53:31,980 --> 00:53:33,960
happened at sea yeah wow okay so

1568
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:36,270
in order to have a murder case

1569
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:39,060
against the suspect they have to recover

1570
00:53:39,090 --> 00:53:40,980
every single body part so that they

1571
00:53:40,980 --> 00:53:43,410
can rule out all these other like

1572
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:44,880
it's own this is a factor

1573
00:53:44,940 --> 00:53:46,770
rules like to murder which scripted show

1574
00:53:46,770 --> 00:53:49,590
based on a real story they dance

1575
00:53:49,590 --> 00:53:52,710
murders like the their ruling murderers who

1576
00:53:52,710 --> 00:53:54,180
keep toes or something so if they

1577
00:53:54,180 --> 00:53:56,190
find the toes there like they have

1578
00:53:56,264 --> 00:53:58,620
there's only one guy it happened on

1579
00:53:58,620 --> 00:54:01,440
a submarine there oh there's one guy

1580
00:54:01,470 --> 00:54:03,090
burying the lead who is the suspect

1581
00:54:03,090 --> 00:54:04,590
not a submarine

1582
00:54:05,850 --> 00:54:09,360
we'll murder da stone taylor submarine

1583
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:12,000
so they have to rule out all

1584
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,100
these because this guy says oh ah

1585
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:16,890
yeah she hit her head and she

1586
00:54:16,890 --> 00:54:18,180
died that's how she died so i

1587
00:54:18,180 --> 00:54:21,180
hit her head i water please that

1588
00:54:21,180 --> 00:54:23,280
could kill you so they have to

1589
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:25,560
rule out everything in order you gotta

1590
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:26,340
jump at the pool

1591
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:30,060
i can't wait to talk with manna

1592
00:54:30,150 --> 00:54:31,860
i'll throw you and you throw me

1593
00:54:31,860 --> 00:54:33,570
in the blind throw you if you're

1594
00:54:33,570 --> 00:54:35,250
the someone needs to roll

1595
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:36,690
hi

1596
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,610
one layer one you better be underwater

1597
00:54:41,610 --> 00:54:44,318
by yeah the season this episode is

1598
00:54:44,340 --> 00:54:46,410
underwater you know there's no law so

1599
00:54:46,410 --> 00:54:48,660
show he she hit her head and

1600
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:49,830
so they i'm just not about that

1601
00:54:50,070 --> 00:54:51,690
no he's saying she hit her head

1602
00:54:51,690 --> 00:54:53,400
and yeah he keeps he keeps changing

1603
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:54,810
his story every time they get a

1604
00:54:54,810 --> 00:54:57,150
new detail because i guess in in

1605
00:54:57,150 --> 00:54:57,900
danish law

1606
00:54:57,900 --> 00:54:59,520
law you're allowed to do this and

1607
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:01,170
you have to just believe this guy's

1608
00:55:01,170 --> 00:55:03,420
story until you can prove beyond a

1609
00:55:03,420 --> 00:55:05,430
shadow of a doubt oh like it's

1610
00:55:05,490 --> 00:55:07,950
it's like i guess it favors the

1611
00:55:07,980 --> 00:55:11,490
accused so much that they're saying we

1612
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:13,530
can't even bring the case because he's

1613
00:55:13,530 --> 00:55:15,244
saying this we have to just pray

1614
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:17,289
have to find the bio dorky yes

1615
00:55:17,289 --> 00:55:18,000
yes yes yes

1616
00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:19,260
right you have to just prove that

1617
00:55:19,260 --> 00:55:20,820
she killed herself we have to disprove

1618
00:55:20,820 --> 00:55:22,920
blah blah blah blah blah like yeah

1619
00:55:22,950 --> 00:55:24,180
to the point where he's saying like

1620
00:55:24,180 --> 00:55:25,680
no i i cut her up and

1621
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:28,200
throw thrower in the ocean because i

1622
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:30,300
was thinking of the family she killed

1623
00:55:30,300 --> 00:55:31,620
herself in the family would have been

1624
00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:34,440
upset you know like that's how wild

1625
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:35,220
it is like huh

1626
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:37,410
so they have to do they it's

1627
00:55:37,410 --> 00:55:38,910
like an impossible task where they have

1628
00:55:38,910 --> 00:55:41,670
to find every single part of this

1629
00:55:41,670 --> 00:55:44,340
woman's body in order to say isn't

1630
00:55:44,340 --> 00:55:46,470
it all like kind of by i

1631
00:55:46,470 --> 00:55:47,880
know that stuff moves around in the

1632
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:49,140
ocean but wouldn't it all be in

1633
00:55:49,140 --> 00:55:51,270
the general area of your life ahead

1634
00:55:51,270 --> 00:55:52,920
is or did he yeah did he

1635
00:55:52,950 --> 00:55:54,720

1658
00:56:49,350 --> 00:56:51,720
decabde say i don't understand sometimes jobs

1659
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:53,430
are important i don't know if this

1660
00:56:53,460 --> 00:56:54,330
if that was part of it in

1661
00:56:54,330 --> 00:56:56,400
real life but it's such a trope

1662
00:56:56,430 --> 00:56:58,410
to throw of detective shit that it's

1663
00:56:58,410 --> 00:57:00,840
like i yeah it doesn't need to

1664
00:57:00,840 --> 00:57:02,605
be in there it doesn't want it

1665
00:57:02,605 --> 00:57:04,530
what purpose does it serve i don't

1666
00:57:04,530 --> 00:57:05,940
get what purpose it just makes me

1667
00:57:05,940 --> 00:57:07,500
annoyed i mean probably

1668
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:10,680
he is a thing with cops spouses

1669
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:12,720
i remember that day i remember in

1670
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:14,670
a very no doubt about that back

1671
00:57:14,670 --> 00:57:17,070
to reality recap every the very first

1672
00:57:17,070 --> 00:57:19,380
episode of cops when they didn't know

1673
00:57:19,380 --> 00:57:20,520
what the show was that it was

1674
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:22,110
just going to be the arrests right

1675
00:57:22,170 --> 00:57:25,380
they they followed the the cop back

1676
00:57:25,380 --> 00:57:27,420
to his house and showed that their

1677
00:57:27,420 --> 00:57:27,660
spouse

1678
00:57:27,660 --> 00:57:29,970
house was really upset about it so

1679
00:57:29,970 --> 00:57:31,680
i think it's a thing about about

1680
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:33,930
the police about like the person constantly

1681
00:57:33,930 --> 00:57:36,150
being gone and yeah ours but you

1682
00:57:36,150 --> 00:57:37,680
don't see it in doctor dramas all

1683
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:40,950
that much because it's like the automatic

1684
00:57:40,950 --> 00:57:42,630
assumption is well doctors are rich and

1685
00:57:42,630 --> 00:57:44,580
so their spouses don't have any reason

1686
00:57:44,580 --> 00:57:46,860
to complain right you know what i

1687
00:57:46,860 --> 00:57:47,820
mean like her do you

1688
00:57:47,850 --> 00:57:49,410
see it in doctor stuff i don't

1689
00:57:49,522 --> 00:57:51,780
feel like i do that docu series

1690
00:57:51,780 --> 00:57:54,750
about the late night stalker person or

1691
00:57:54,750 --> 00:57:58,350
the nights years yeah it's a scary

1692
00:57:58,530 --> 00:58:01,020
series but once you got to you

1693
00:58:01,020 --> 00:58:01,380
nailed it

1694
00:58:02,670 --> 00:58:07,200
the detective they they interviewed his wife

1695
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:09,180
and she was like it was very

1696
00:58:09,180 --> 00:58:10,890
hard to be together during the whole

1697
00:58:10,890 --> 00:58:12,540
time she went somewhere else because they're

1698
00:58:12,540 --> 00:58:15,060
also afraid you know it actually the

1699
00:58:15,090 --> 00:58:17,130
trip was good and mind hunter i

1700
00:58:17,130 --> 00:58:21,660
think because that he had specific challenges

1701
00:58:21,660 --> 00:58:22,080
with

1702
00:58:22,650 --> 00:58:24,450
ah with his kid the older cut

1703
00:58:24,450 --> 00:58:27,330
yeah yeah and and the the just

1704
00:58:27,330 --> 00:58:31,051
how depressing that case was not like

1705
00:58:31,051 --> 00:58:32,850
it was well done in that absolutely

1706
00:58:33,150 --> 00:58:34,620
but for the most part it just

1707
00:58:34,620 --> 00:58:36,240
seems like a lazy thing that doesn't

1708
00:58:36,300 --> 00:58:38,310
especially in a movie where it's just

1709
00:58:38,310 --> 00:58:40,260
one scene in order to elicit a

1710
00:58:40,260 --> 00:58:41,700
response from you of like wow this

1711
00:58:41,850 --> 00:58:42,780
our main characters pray

1712
00:58:42,780 --> 00:58:45,150
columns i yell for him but it's

1713
00:58:45,150 --> 00:58:48,240
like you're already yoga lowered you're already

1714
00:58:49,290 --> 00:58:51,870
yeah with the character like he's it's

1715
00:58:51,870 --> 00:58:53,910
hard to solve a murder you know

1716
00:58:53,910 --> 00:58:55,230
i mean yeah it's not fair to

1717
00:58:55,230 --> 00:58:56,640
be taking that out on him

1718
00:58:57,690 --> 00:58:59,100
would you like to solve murders paul

1719
00:58:59,370 --> 00:59:01,590
i have which my wife and i

1720
00:59:01,590 --> 00:59:02,340
get along great

1721
00:59:03,450 --> 00:59:04,560
i think it sounds kind of fun

1722
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:06,180
to be a detective i think it

1723
00:59:06,180 --> 00:59:06,720
would be fun

1724
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:09,270
because like do you ever read the

1725
00:59:09,270 --> 00:59:11,880
book homicide life on the streets yeah

1726
00:59:11,940 --> 00:59:13,680
but so i will i think that

1727
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:15,180
it's very trendy right now to solve

1728
00:59:15,180 --> 00:59:18,180
murders well to do it's very timeless

1729
00:59:18,810 --> 00:59:21,030
hi gerry o'carroll it's like everyone's like

1730
00:59:21,030 --> 00:59:22,680
wanting to watch things about murder and

1731
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:24,480
listen to things about murder yes murder

1732
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:26,130
and murder is having a moment that

1733
00:59:26,130 --> 00:59:27,420
it is and i don't know about

1734
00:59:27,420 --> 00:59:27,900
that anything

1735
00:59:27,930 --> 00:59:29,730
about that i we've always been ah

1736
00:59:29,820 --> 00:59:31,440
we've always been fascinated by that and

1737
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:33,660
you can look at your old old

1738
00:59:33,690 --> 00:59:37,860
um ah sensationalized crime like it's always

1739
00:59:37,860 --> 00:59:39,150
been a thing that people are drawn

1740
00:59:39,150 --> 00:59:41,250
to we've never remember when teen made

1741
00:59:41,250 --> 00:59:43,080
a podcast about able huh

1742
00:59:45,035 --> 00:59:47,313
you mean my character from lucifer that's

1743
00:59:47,313 --> 00:59:47,790
your eight

1744
00:59:52,350 --> 00:59:54,360
i don't think we've ever had as

1745
00:59:54,360 --> 00:59:58,500
much um access and ways to distribute

1746
00:59:58,530 --> 01:00:00,810
stories about it as we do now

1747
01:00:01,110 --> 01:00:03,480
and once people also once people it

1748
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:05,310
became like it came out of a

1749
01:00:05,340 --> 01:00:07,440
guilty pleasure kind of thing and into

1750
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:09,150
just being like mainstream entertained

1751
01:00:09,180 --> 01:00:11,340
but you know well also the cbs

1752
01:00:11,340 --> 01:00:14,100
shows yeah you know sure i bring

1753
01:00:14,100 --> 01:00:16,080
up homicidal mines or whatever i guess

1754
01:00:16,139 --> 01:00:17,670
i bring up homicide life on the

1755
01:00:17,670 --> 01:00:20,130
street again because young sheldon it's fast

1756
01:00:21,240 --> 01:00:23,100
kill young sheldon know he was killing

1757
01:00:23,100 --> 01:00:25,140
he was on a killing spree yeah

1758
01:00:25,560 --> 01:00:26,941
and that's why he's so weird that

1759
01:00:26,953 --> 01:00:28,320
he just became a nerd

1760
01:00:29,700 --> 01:00:32,190
but um homicide they they talk ah

1761
01:00:32,220 --> 01:00:34,290
there there it's a really fascinating book

1762
01:00:34,290 --> 01:00:35,460
and they talk about how long it

1763
01:00:35,460 --> 01:00:37,980
takes to solve murders right and there

1764
01:00:38,340 --> 01:00:40,590
because it basically it's david simon starts

1765
01:00:40,620 --> 01:00:42,600
on january first of one year and

1766
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:44,460
then he ends on december thirty first

1767
01:00:44,460 --> 01:00:46,410
of another year yeah and there is

1768
01:00:46,410 --> 01:00:49,500
a murder that plagues them the entire

1769
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:51,330
our year that they never solved right

1770
01:00:51,510 --> 01:00:53,010
well and it tracks that and but

1771
01:00:53,010 --> 01:00:54,660
but that it it then you watch

1772
01:00:54,660 --> 01:00:56,730
these cop shows and it's a different

1773
01:00:56,730 --> 01:00:59,490
murder or multiple murder every single week

1774
01:00:59,490 --> 01:01:01,200
and one town it's like if life

1775
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:03,150
were really like that i would move

1776
01:01:03,150 --> 01:01:05,580
away from wherever there you know it's

1777
01:01:05,580 --> 01:01:07,680
like there there's not that much murder

1778
01:01:08,010 --> 01:01:09,450
i know there are murders in the

1779
01:01:09,450 --> 01:01:09,660
world

1780
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:12,410
that much do you know that um

1781
01:01:12,620 --> 01:01:14,630
like i billy johnson who he was

1782
01:01:14,630 --> 01:01:17,318

gone in the other guns i will

1791
01:01:33,558 --> 01:01:33,770
not

1792
01:01:35,090 --> 01:01:37,580
death cab for cutie song of berlin

1793
01:01:37,580 --> 01:01:39,200
are you into the dark

1794
01:01:41,150 --> 01:01:42,140
you know what i always think about

1795
01:01:42,140 --> 01:01:44,450
him just decided about death cab that

1796
01:01:44,450 --> 01:01:46,790
when he got divorced from zoe deschanel

1797
01:01:48,230 --> 01:01:49,217
i don't know if he had him

1798
01:01:49,220 --> 01:01:50,360
yet but they released all of her

1799
01:01:50,570 --> 01:01:53,150
bank statements all of her spain personally

1800
01:01:53,150 --> 01:01:54,740
habits on her bank statements but her

1801
01:01:55,190 --> 01:01:57,560
her spending because it's part of the

1802
01:01:57,560 --> 01:01:59,180
divorce things where he wanted money or

1803
01:01:59,180 --> 01:02:01,400
whatever else maybe that that seems like

1804
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:03,020
a tmc thing where they get their

1805
01:02:03,020 --> 01:02:05,420
well it was something not cool yeah

1806
01:02:05,510 --> 01:02:06,846
who know all look it up but

1807
01:02:06,846 --> 01:02:08,090
but this guy billy johnson

1808
01:02:08,090 --> 01:02:10,160
and who i met doing his podcast

1809
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:11,450
which was all about murder when i

1810
01:02:11,450 --> 01:02:13,580
think they were doing like um a

1811
01:02:13,580 --> 01:02:14,780
sort of month of talking to people

1812
01:02:14,780 --> 01:02:15,860
who have nothing to do with this

1813
01:02:15,860 --> 01:02:16,940
and so i was like this why

1814
01:02:16,940 --> 01:02:18,290
i'm here like it was some of

1815
01:02:18,290 --> 01:02:19,280
the bachelor with him it was like

1816
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:20,330
random as fuck and i'm sure the

1817
01:02:20,330 --> 01:02:21,560
listeners were like why is this happening

1818
01:02:22,010 --> 01:02:23,390
but i really liked him and he'd

1819
01:02:23,417 --> 01:02:25,670
follow my instagram and he is always

1820
01:02:25,670 --> 01:02:28,250
seeming to be solving some raw

1821
01:02:28,250 --> 01:02:31,010

store i knew we'd have one attorneys

2058
01:11:09,980 --> 01:11:11,720
it's gonna happen the minute we sold

2059
01:11:11,720 --> 01:11:12,170
that joe

2060
01:11:12,875 --> 01:11:14,345
yeah it tells me this is right

2061
01:11:14,855 --> 01:11:16,415
wow well no of course i mean

2062
01:11:16,415 --> 01:11:18,005
i can't from looking you're right

2063
01:11:19,595 --> 01:11:22,205
you can for looking know i can

2064
01:11:22,235 --> 01:11:23,825
i wouldn't be able to tell if

2065
01:11:23,825 --> 01:11:26,465
it's right or wrong happening can't see

2066
01:11:26,465 --> 01:11:29,285
how the it is affected the mood

2067
01:11:29,285 --> 01:11:31,655
of the creature i'll maybe a slight

2068
01:11:31,655 --> 01:11:33,815
downturn in the smile but i mean

2069
01:11:33,905 --> 01:11:36,605
the smile example when she always has

2070
01:11:36,605 --> 01:11:38,615
my oh it's an animal i think

2071
01:11:38,645 --> 01:11:39,275
ken smile

2072
01:11:39,275 --> 01:11:41,165
while i'd like to see smiles where

2073
01:11:41,165 --> 01:11:43,445
there are none like on my face

2074
01:11:43,445 --> 01:11:45,155
so so this you're telling me this

2075
01:11:45,155 --> 01:11:46,985
animal can't smile it's just an optical

2076
01:11:46,985 --> 01:11:49,565
illusion well i wouldn't say smiles i

2077
01:11:49,565 --> 01:11:51,455
mean yeah it's yeah it's kind of

2078
01:11:51,455 --> 01:11:52,295
a neutral but

2079
01:11:53,825 --> 01:11:55,415
but you choose to interpret it as

2080
01:11:55,415 --> 01:11:57,455
a child that's what i'm into well

2081
01:11:57,455 --> 01:11:59,675
that's very positive that's how i'm an

2082
01:11:59,675 --> 01:12:00,935
optum together as long as we have

2083
01:12:00,935 --> 01:12:03,335
but yeah i would argue no way

2084
01:12:03,335 --> 01:12:04,955
out let me ask you so to

2085
01:12:04,955 --> 01:12:06,845
you this looks normal who gets to

2086
01:12:06,845 --> 01:12:07,745
keep the business

2087
01:12:09,515 --> 01:12:11,105
have you read the outside i know

2088
01:12:12,575 --> 01:12:13,565
yeah it looks like the name of

2089
01:12:13,565 --> 01:12:14,015
my store

2090
01:12:15,125 --> 01:12:17,195
what is it again well i'm not

2091
01:12:17,195 --> 01:12:18,305
so lassen did you like

2092
01:12:19,385 --> 01:12:21,335
i didn't really pay much call did

2093
01:12:21,335 --> 01:12:23,195
you like it oh no i didn't

2094
01:12:23,195 --> 01:12:24,425
pay attention to that i just saw

2095
01:12:24,425 --> 01:12:25,640
that it's so easy old pets and

2096
01:12:25,640 --> 01:12:27,155
i came here about this bet every

2097
01:12:27,155 --> 01:12:29,855
time a satisfied customer leaves the store

2098
01:12:29,885 --> 01:12:31,175
we say to them did you like

2099
01:12:31,175 --> 01:12:33,035
it and they never answer because they're

2100
01:12:33,035 --> 01:12:35,105
already gone and they also just got

2101
01:12:35,105 --> 01:12:36,545
the patch so why would that site

2102
01:12:36,545 --> 01:12:38,105
i know rick wage doesn't make any

2103
01:12:38,105 --> 01:12:39,395
sense she wanted to name it that

2104
01:12:39,395 --> 01:12:39,515
it's

2105
01:12:39,695 --> 01:12:41,165
well it's my hope is that they'll

2106
01:12:41,165 --> 01:12:43,055
be return customers and they'd come back

2107
01:12:43,055 --> 01:12:44,165
and i'd say did you like giving

2108
01:12:44,165 --> 01:12:45,275
you want some more i am a

2109
01:12:45,275 --> 01:12:46,655
return customer and then i'd like to

2110
01:12:46,655 --> 01:12:48,755
return this pet which is defective what

2111
01:12:48,755 --> 01:12:49,775
do you think is wrong with it

2112
01:12:49,775 --> 01:12:51,185
i really can't want to i think

2113
01:12:51,185 --> 01:12:52,805
is wrong with it are you telling

2114
01:12:52,805 --> 01:12:53,825
me this is the way it's supposed

2115
01:12:53,825 --> 01:12:55,385
to look that's the way i suppose

2116
01:12:55,385 --> 01:12:57,065
yeah so then it is an internal

2117
01:12:57,065 --> 01:12:59,345
problem yes sort of

2118
01:12:59,675 --> 01:13:01,445
because you know what the problem is

2119
01:13:01,475 --> 01:13:03,515
i know it's not external but we

2120
01:13:03,515 --> 01:13:04,805
wouldn't be able to tell by looking

2121
01:13:04,805 --> 01:13:06,935
at it i can't i'm not really

2122
01:13:06,935 --> 01:13:07,955

tell of eight years to shed customer

2139
01:13:43,685 --> 01:13:45,035
what's wrong with that thing and what

2140
01:13:45,035 --> 01:13:45,995
is that we will have to use

2141
01:13:45,995 --> 01:13:47,075
one of our other senses of the

2142
01:13:47,075 --> 01:13:49,115
venere eyes okay right yeah i mean

2143
01:13:49,115 --> 01:13:49,355
it's it's

2144
01:13:49,355 --> 01:13:51,275
supposed to smell this way yes yes

2145
01:13:51,275 --> 01:13:52,655
of course it is it's supposed to

2146
01:13:52,655 --> 01:13:54,035
sound like the sound it's making you

2147
01:13:54,065 --> 01:13:57,035
know i admit it's not okay so

2148
01:13:57,035 --> 01:14:00,485
then the sound that it makes usually

2149
01:14:01,175 --> 01:14:05,435
is familiar inaudible it's familiar to anyone

2150
01:14:05,705 --> 01:14:08,225
yeah so it's inaudible that is familiar

2151
01:14:08,225 --> 01:14:09,335
the absence of saudis

2152
01:14:09,575 --> 01:14:12,155
yeah inaudible use familiar to anyone hear

2153
01:14:12,155 --> 01:14:14,435
it okay so normally it doesn't make

2154
01:14:14,435 --> 01:14:16,175
a lot of noise true oh it's

2155
01:14:16,205 --> 01:14:18,693
silent it's silent pants asylum pet yes

2156
01:14:18,693 --> 01:14:20,735
okay then something is wrong because this

2157
01:14:20,735 --> 01:14:22,025
thing is making a noise as you

2158
01:14:22,025 --> 01:14:24,275
can hear yes of course okay yes

2159
01:14:24,365 --> 01:14:26,675
and i i find this noise is

2160
01:14:26,705 --> 01:14:29,675
indescribable how would you describe it yeah

2161
01:14:29,692 --> 01:14:32,705
yes i mean i hear the experts

2162
01:14:32,735 --> 01:14:34,685
obviously bit as something that could happen

2163
01:14:34,685 --> 01:14:37,325
to anyone from ah from human to

2164
01:14:37,325 --> 01:14:41,615
animal yeah it's definitely it's it doesn't

2165
01:14:41,615 --> 01:14:43,595
sound good i'll tell you that much

2166
01:14:44,315 --> 01:14:46,895
no it doesn't sound good yeah and

2167
01:14:46,895 --> 01:14:49,235
so normally this would not be making

2168
01:14:49,235 --> 01:14:49,835
noises that

2169
01:14:49,865 --> 01:14:51,575
correct correct okay because it was not

2170
01:14:51,575 --> 01:14:53,585
making noise when i bought it and

2171
01:14:53,585 --> 01:14:58,145
shit noise ever yeah alright and should

2172
01:14:58,145 --> 01:15:01,475
it should it be this big this

2173
01:15:01,535 --> 01:15:03,125
short appropriate so that's an appropriate size

2174
01:15:03,125 --> 01:15:05,825
this is within all small accurate parameters

2175
01:15:05,915 --> 01:15:08,105
so it's it's typically it's small like

2176
01:15:08,105 --> 01:15:09,995
it is yeah okay alright

2177
01:15:09,995 --> 01:15:12,485
a small house looking for somebody like

2178
01:15:12,485 --> 01:15:12,545
him

2179
01:15:13,655 --> 01:15:16,415
gotta like he has that coloring all

2180
01:15:16,415 --> 01:15:18,635

a medical issue i don't know why

2231
01:16:59,705 --> 01:17:01,505
you're bringing it into us also is

2232
01:17:01,565 --> 01:17:02,555
gastrointestinal

2233
01:17:03,875 --> 01:17:05,615

how do you know about us i

2236
01:17:10,597 --> 01:17:13,205
read some yelp review oh okay god

2237
01:17:13,355 --> 01:17:14,885
but it's when it's more common yeah

2238
01:17:14,885 --> 01:17:16,085
it's more of a common thing i

2239
01:17:16,085 --> 01:17:17,195
don't know what not you know could

2240
01:17:17,195 --> 01:17:18,214
mean something really bad or i mean

2241
01:17:18,214 --> 01:17:21,035
nothing at all yeah like it's it's

2242
01:17:21,035 --> 01:17:23,765
happening in regular intervals yeah so it's

2243
01:17:23,765 --> 01:17:25,445
got hiccups would you say no not

2244
01:17:25,475 --> 01:17:28,235
a hick i mean the shy hiccups

2245
01:17:28,267 --> 01:17:30,665
would be something that would just go

2246
01:17:30,665 --> 01:17:31,865
away on it's own i mean this

2247
01:17:31,865 --> 01:17:34,265
seems like it's something that would need

2248
01:17:34,295 --> 01:17:36,245
persistent yeah it's persisted it was making

2249
01:17:36,245 --> 01:17:37,895
a persistent noise that will not go

2250
01:17:37,895 --> 01:17:40,745
away yes it's i mean it certainly

2251
01:17:40,745 --> 01:17:42,155
hasn't ever since it's been in here

2252
01:17:42,245 --> 01:17:44,225
and it could happen to you what

2253
01:17:45,305 --> 01:17:46,955
she's talking about her favorite movie it

2254
01:17:46,955 --> 01:17:48,215
can happen yeah maybe he wins a

2255
01:17:48,215 --> 01:17:50,495
lot of bridget fonda nicholas cage

2256
01:17:51,515 --> 01:17:52,865
remember the themes under that movie

2257
01:17:54,215 --> 01:17:55,835
it could happen to you

2258
01:17:57,785 --> 01:17:59,015
that i mean there wasn't a theme

2259
01:17:59,015 --> 01:18:00,665
song she just was singing that's the

2260
01:18:00,665 --> 01:18:03,035
boot happened to you the audience members

2261
01:18:03,035 --> 01:18:04,595
were pleading with her to be quiet

2262
01:18:04,625 --> 01:18:06,005
so there wasn't a theme food you're

2263
01:18:06,005 --> 01:18:08,435
after she remembered when she sang that

2264
01:18:08,435 --> 01:18:09,545
got kicked out of the movie i

2265
01:18:09,545 --> 01:18:11,555
said yes i like to be carried

2266
01:18:11,555 --> 01:18:12,215
out of places

2267
01:18:13,385 --> 01:18:15,215
um so it's pretty she has to

2268
01:18:15,215 --> 01:18:16,415
walk out of a place she will

2269
01:18:16,415 --> 01:18:17,735
do anything in her power to make

2270
01:18:17,735 --> 01:18:19,625
sure that she's carried again i don't

2271
01:18:19,625 --> 01:18:22,325
care so the persistence nowhere the petition

2272
01:18:22,325 --> 01:18:23,945
noise is something that i could i

2273
01:18:23,945 --> 01:18:25,745
could also be making i hope that

2274
01:18:25,745 --> 01:18:27,215
you don't catch it yeah yeah what

2275
01:18:27,215 --> 01:18:28,235
are some noises you might make

2276
01:18:30,005 --> 01:18:32,615
that are medical conditions sure things that

2277
01:18:32,615 --> 01:18:33,455
the body does

2278
01:18:35,225 --> 01:18:36,485
okay so

2279
01:18:37,745 --> 01:18:40,865
ah i thought i ruled something out

2280
01:18:41,135 --> 01:18:44,285
you probably did gastrointestinal yeah sure but

2281
01:18:44,285 --> 01:18:46,025
there's other places sounds can come out

2282
01:18:46,025 --> 01:18:48,583
say why not that anyway well i'll

2283
01:18:48,583 --> 01:18:51,095
go pick one he doesn't have covert

2284
01:18:51,155 --> 01:18:53,165
but you know it's alarming but it

2285
01:18:53,165 --> 01:18:55,025
but it could it it the it's

2286
01:18:55,025 --> 01:18:57,755
it i hope he didn't vocal noise

2287
01:18:57,755 --> 01:19:00,995
is not related to gastrointestinal issues and

2288
01:19:01,025 --> 01:19:02,945
it could happen to me it could

2289
01:19:02,945 --> 01:19:04,145
be coven but i don't want to

2290
01:19:04,145 --> 01:19:05,855
rule it out i hope the coven

2291
01:19:05,885 --> 01:19:07,295
i give oh okay so it's not

2292
01:19:07,295 --> 01:19:08,795

2293
01:19:08,795 --> 01:19:11,705

2294
01:19:11,705 --> 01:19:15,485

2375
01:22:24,440 --> 01:22:26,690
know you know what what's an issue

2376
01:22:26,690 --> 01:22:30,080
that you're saying well the invisibility is

2377
01:22:30,080 --> 01:22:33,020
just a huge aspect to this but

2378
01:22:33,080 --> 01:22:34,580
i don't think that's it's oh

2379
01:22:34,790 --> 01:22:36,290
i'm thinking my other pet that's right

that at some point this creature is

2382
01:22:39,740 --> 01:22:41,600
very real and cannot do anything like

2383
01:22:41,600 --> 01:22:43,880
that oh yeah yeah it looks okay

2384
01:22:43,880 --> 01:22:47,930

2385
01:22:47,930 --> 01:22:49,670
