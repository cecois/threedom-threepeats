122
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:17,370

of people you think of them as

143
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:58,050
being over the image of the purse

144
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,470
of the image silently mouthing along yeah

145
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:03,000

i had heard about it somewhere and

214
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:31,110
then i heard about it again so

215
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:32,370
that's what drew me to watch three

216
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:34,290
times usually to yeah in order for

217
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:37,020
something to solidify yeah i heard opioids

219
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:40,920
appeared i heard it referenced on a

220
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,420
podcast i think and then i

221
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,970
heard it on rosie o'donnell has a

222
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:46,470
new podcast that i was listening to

223
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:48,600
and her guess was rory kennedy who's

224
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,730
a documentary filmmaker oh you listening to

225
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:52,800
podcasts that aren't this yeah i know

226
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:54,510
we've thought about that before but i

227
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:56,610
will do it and i listened i

228
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:58,410
remember when you said scott och don't

229
00:07:58,410 --> 00:08:01,110
want your live yeah yeah it was

230
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:02,370
crying yeah

231
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:05,700
but anyway worry kennedy made the documentary

232
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:06,810
and so i was like well let

233
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:08,820
me show you can't say rory kennedy

234
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:10,890
she's a documentary filmmaker it's very sad

235
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:13,920
but she's also a kennedy oh kennedy

236
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:19,140
kennedy yeah haha ah yeah and the

237
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:20,730
first thing people think over they think

238
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:22,110
of kennedy it's the story well because

239
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:22,650
rosie was like

240
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,030
why didn't i hear about this and

241
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:25,170
then she was kind of spending she

242
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:26,131
didn't really hear about at the time

243
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,080
she was like touche balls still ah

244
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:30,390
rosie on the podcast she does throw

245
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:32,460
them like into the mic every kind

246
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:33,750
of few words you hear like a

247
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:37,440
soft thump yeah foosball um and ah

248
00:08:38,010 --> 00:08:40,080
anyway whooosh it was said that there

249
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,010
was a lot of stuff could get

250
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:42,480
an american news cycle at that point

251
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:42,960
so it wasn't really

252
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:45,030
we breaking through much but then it's

253
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:46,320
crazy when you i think it's i

254
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,790
recommend it's on netflix and it's just

255
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:49,020
a wild i don't want to give

256
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,670
you know tell you the whole story

257
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:52,650
because long as it's probably an hour

258
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:54,180
and a half and what was the

259
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:55,740
time we get that down to about

260
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:58,920
forty five minutes um you can if

261
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,630
you just skip around i guess that's

262
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:02,700
a little bit disrespectful shy skip around

263
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:03,120
in order

264
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,650
or make it like pulp fiction i

265
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:06,840
would say watch the first forty five

266
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:09,146
and then you then stop to watch

267
00:09:09,146 --> 00:09:10,710
just stop yeah yeah okay cool

268
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:12,540
um no watch the whole thing it

269
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:13,920
was really good what was the timeframe

270
00:09:14,801 --> 00:09:16,950
i don't want to twenty nineteen twenty

271
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:19,650
and twenty nineteen was not long before

272
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:20,700
the pandemic though so i think it

273
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:23,040
was like chaos oh because it was

274
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,510
all like the because people were like

275
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:25,080
always

276
00:09:27,306 --> 00:09:28,650
get ready we're saying there's a lot

277
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:30,090
of trump stuff at that time that

278
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:32,820
was actually the yes yes yes um

279
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:35,880
but it's really rather available mobile it

280
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:40,050
was extremely tourist going to um visit

281
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:42,750

282
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:43,980

of excursion that you know we could

288
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:53,130
just like that in hawaii when we

289
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:54,510
were wanting to go on a helicopter

290
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:55,830
ride it's right it's just something that

291
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:57,570
went awry but the core four didn't

292
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,580
yeah we didn't want to go outdoor

293
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:01,200
no we did not want and then

294
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,820
they ended up being cancelled right the

295
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:05,400
helicopter we hear something to wendy yeah

296
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:06,480

yeah haven't noticed it's when we had

298
00:10:08,265 --> 00:10:11,025
a nice dinner we had a nice

299
00:10:11,025 --> 00:10:13,215

300
00:10:13,215 --> 00:10:14,625
was a great night was a great

301
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:17,115
night yeah because because cool up the

302
00:10:17,115 --> 00:10:18,195

what ended up happening yeah we didn't

308
00:10:26,535 --> 00:10:27,215

309
00:10:27,355 --> 00:10:29,055
only for people who went up went

310
00:10:29,055 --> 00:10:30,855
to do the helicopter right that was

311
00:10:30,855 --> 00:10:32,655
a different story because i think that

312
00:10:32,655 --> 00:10:35,385
was child john nora tim and the

313
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:37,095

ought to be yeah you agree isn't

321
00:10:51,315 --> 00:10:52,605
it kind of impressive that we have

00:10:52,605 --> 00:10:54,675
a text chain that's still going this

323
00:10:54,675 --> 00:10:56,445

469
00:15:30,615 --> 00:15:31,815
i'd love to do it i'd love

470
00:15:31,815 --> 00:15:34,515
to do whatever you want um i

471
00:15:34,545 --> 00:15:36,130
want to try that oh i like

472
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:39,408
to do podcasts and um you you

473
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:41,175
you're getting more back into this i

474
00:15:41,175 --> 00:15:42,915
yeah man yeah i'm getting because you

475
00:15:42,915 --> 00:15:44,084
had two babies for a while yeah

476
00:15:44,084 --> 00:15:46,661
yeah holly and yeah my nicole with

477
00:15:46,665 --> 00:15:46,725
the

478
00:15:46,725 --> 00:15:48,255
the other show that we had new

479
00:15:48,285 --> 00:15:50,325
comers was a lot and someone's doing

480
00:15:50,355 --> 00:15:52,665
a podcast really is a lot especially

481
00:15:52,665 --> 00:15:53,685
one where you have to watch three

482
00:15:53,685 --> 00:15:55,425
hour movie that's what really gets yeah

483
00:15:55,508 --> 00:15:57,075
yeah they were all three hour movie

484
00:15:57,075 --> 00:15:58,755
now except for the title so i

485
00:15:58,785 --> 00:16:00,885
mentioned this on doughboys but chris colfer

486
00:16:00,885 --> 00:16:03,585
who i met at naomi peregrine's wedding

487
00:16:03,975 --> 00:16:06,885
suggested that man for the next

488
00:16:06,885 --> 00:16:08,535
last season and i actually thought that

489
00:16:08,535 --> 00:16:10,215
made sense though because once you do

490
00:16:10,215 --> 00:16:11,625
an episode for every episode of the

491
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:13,005
television show yeah we would

492
00:16:14,141 --> 00:16:15,795
everything else is a diamond ni episode

493
00:16:15,795 --> 00:16:18,495
three years if i'm guessing that's why

494
00:16:18,525 --> 00:16:21,135
it was like brady episodes i just

495
00:16:21,135 --> 00:16:23,775
crushed that was easy the shit that

496
00:16:24,045 --> 00:16:26,445
that lasted in three channel days it's

497
00:16:26,475 --> 00:16:28,005
while i'm like this is a big

498
00:16:28,005 --> 00:16:29,955
hit everybody watched it it was three

499
00:16:30,255 --> 00:16:31,935
three seasons but you want to know

500
00:16:31,935 --> 00:16:32,955
how many episodes they did

501
00:16:34,005 --> 00:16:36,045
oh yes ten h or something guess

502
00:16:36,315 --> 00:16:39,315
oh i mean ten each so thirty

503
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:40,935
my ex sure that was seventy but

504
00:16:40,965 --> 00:16:42,825
i'm saying thirty you're saying thirty what

505
00:16:42,855 --> 00:16:48,195
what's three seasons um probably automatic way

506
00:16:48,195 --> 00:16:51,585
more over i'm gonna say yeah i'll

507
00:16:51,585 --> 00:16:54,165
say like seventy no i'm going to

508
00:16:54,195 --> 00:16:56,265
say a hundred you're saying okay but

509
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:58,095
you can't go over ninety

510
00:16:59,355 --> 00:17:00,945
so you're saying ninety you're saying seventy

511
00:17:00,945 --> 00:17:01,665
one yeah

512
00:17:02,865 --> 00:17:04,335
one hundred and twenty learn you in

513
00:17:04,995 --> 00:17:06,165
three years if you do one hundred

514
00:17:06,165 --> 00:17:08,355
and eight with sixty in one season

515
00:17:08,415 --> 00:17:09,435
it would make sense for telling me

516
00:17:09,435 --> 00:17:09,765
ten

517
00:17:10,965 --> 00:17:13,695
it's sixty episodes of the season here's

518
00:17:13,695 --> 00:17:14,835
what i think happened it was it

519
00:17:14,835 --> 00:17:16,365
was like they did one season of

520
00:17:16,365 --> 00:17:17,984
thirty four it was so pop and

521
00:17:17,984 --> 00:17:20,265
became such a like phenomenon season of

522
00:17:20,265 --> 00:17:22,965
thirty four they've ended sixty and then

523
00:17:23,025 --> 00:17:24,525
they only did twenty six the third

524
00:17:24,525 --> 00:17:25,995
season it got cancelled so i think

525
00:17:26,055 --> 00:17:27,855
like everyone was over it but wow

526
00:17:28,035 --> 00:17:30,975
that's nuts yeah yeah oh do you

527
00:17:31,035 --> 00:17:31,125
like

528
00:17:31,155 --> 00:17:33,015
that would drive me crazy to do

529
00:17:33,015 --> 00:17:34,875
bettman i've seen some well every every

530
00:17:34,875 --> 00:17:36,795
episode of this of the batman series

531
00:17:36,795 --> 00:17:38,145
is exactly this i'm not doing every

532
00:17:38,145 --> 00:17:40,005
episode of the batman series i'm due

533
00:17:40,035 --> 00:17:42,855
maybe one of the of the series

534
00:17:42,885 --> 00:17:44,295
now you got what no no you

535
00:17:44,295 --> 00:17:45,555
should do the bem is the sixty

536
00:17:45,555 --> 00:17:47,895
six movie because that's yeah it's a

537
00:17:47,895 --> 00:17:49,905
nightmare that man movies because otherwise they

538
00:17:49,905 --> 00:17:51,225
were getting the batman cartoon yeah

539
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:53,235
that gives you all of the batman

540
00:17:53,325 --> 00:17:54,525
of that area that you need so

541
00:17:54,525 --> 00:17:56,145
you do the sixty six pounds hard

542
00:17:56,145 --> 00:17:59,145
it sounds har eighty nine ninety you

543
00:17:59,175 --> 00:18:01,365
two or one whichever it was then

544
00:18:01,365 --> 00:18:05,025
ninety five ninety seven and then the

545
00:18:05,025 --> 00:18:08,445
three ah more for nolan's and then

546
00:18:08,475 --> 00:18:09,885
the reason when you have nine episodes

547
00:18:09,885 --> 00:18:10,695
right there and then you could do

548
00:18:10,695 --> 00:18:11,415
a cartoon here

549
00:18:11,484 --> 00:18:13,125
there if you want to want to

550
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:14,715
do erotic fanfiction which we loved your

551
00:18:14,895 --> 00:18:17,295
sleep to me that sounds like a

552
00:18:17,295 --> 00:18:19,335
drag to me it doesn't i mean

553
00:18:19,395 --> 00:18:21,885
the entire thing is hard season i

554
00:18:21,885 --> 00:18:23,805

go yeah sort of the same location

768
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:18,100
and that's where it's getting out of

769
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:18,940
control yeah

770
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:20,500

773
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:24,970
mine mentioned it that they were doing

774
00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:29,650
it on instagram is to vacuum seal

775
00:25:29,650 --> 00:25:32,920
vacuum pack clothes oh so you put

776
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:35,413
don't wear yes she put em in

777
00:25:35,413 --> 00:25:36,730
a bag then you have this little

778
00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:38,380
vacuum attachment sucks all the air out

779
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:39,160
so it makes it into

780
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:41,590
like a pink lat little pancake pink

781
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:42,400

again then you can store it and

783
00:25:44,290 --> 00:25:45,490
it takes up less room but so

784
00:25:45,490 --> 00:25:47,290

like grade school that cigarettes robert smith

896
00:29:32,530 --> 00:29:35,080
as my instructor i hate this i

897
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:37,540
hate the smell soil is shallow co

898
00:29:37,630 --> 00:29:40,090
my roommate college was a co we

899
00:29:40,090 --> 00:29:41,800
haven't done is roommate ah what was

900
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,690
it called roommate roundup no

901
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,910
restaurant roundup but i will say very

902
00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:47,170
very few and far between i didn't

903
00:29:47,170 --> 00:29:48,880
have ah i was actually afraid because

904
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,620
i knew that when you inhaled them

905
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:52,240
they had like shards of glass in

906
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,500
it or something i was like shards

907
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:55,000
of something and say like i mean

908
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,310
that's not literal but like something was

909
00:29:57,310 --> 00:30:00,130
really bad clothes that you shouldn't actually

910
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:02,367
inhale into your lungs let me look

911
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:03,850
as i ever heard okay maybe my

912
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:09,190
rye which should you not inhale cloves

913
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:12,580
but that's because burning clubs releases a

914
00:30:12,580 --> 00:30:15,970
chemical called eugenol a topical anesthetic used

915
00:30:15,970 --> 00:30:18,730
by dentists to numb the mau yes

916
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:21,400
for smokers inhaling clove smoke means numbing

917
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,530
the throat which allows them to breathe

918
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:24,100
the smoking more

919
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:26,138
ah good thing it's the opposite oh

920
00:30:26,138 --> 00:30:26,880

934
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:54,570
while to me too it's crazy i

was just like really thirty years later

936
00:30:56,850 --> 00:30:58,590

00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,850
to see a play and then everyone

940
00:31:05,910 --> 00:31:07,737
like you know before the plays like

941
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:09,900

me and my pals from that era

946
00:31:16,770 --> 00:31:18,750
yeah yeah and i just i assume

947
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:20,640
boom anytime i see someone i'm assume

948
00:31:20,646 --> 00:31:22,800
like oh yeah you put that away

949
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:24,180
in your twenties or whatever yeah but

950
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:25,830
i can't put also that's the hardest

951
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:27,570
thing to quit so it's like if

952
00:31:27,570 --> 00:31:28,740
you're kind of like this kind of

953
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:31,230
fun you keep doing it forever well

954
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:32,580
yeah but the thing if it i

955
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:33,600
mean i don't smoke cigarettes i don't

956
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,340
really know i mean i don't see

957
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:38,910
cigarettes yeah okay yeah

958
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,230
okay yeah it's okay

959
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:44,010
but cool i brought up also it

960
00:31:44,010 --> 00:31:47,280
may it may be in appetite ah

961
00:31:47,370 --> 00:31:49,980
suppress suppress welford and make sure maybe

962
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:51,660
they're just smoking socially as an appetite

963
00:31:51,690 --> 00:31:53,100
yeah maybe they're all smoking together because

964
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:54,540
they're all back together yeah it could

965
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:55,500
be i don't know i shouldn't be

966
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:57,120
so judgment but i just was like

967
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:58,821
no it's more surprising because it's like

968
00:31:58,821 --> 00:31:59,730
a lot people quit by now the

969
00:31:59,730 --> 00:32:01,470
stuff around smoking about

970
00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:03,780
what about quitting appetite suppressant all that

971
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:07,170
stuff is it's pretty much all bullshit

972
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:08,880
you know i mean it doesn't people

973
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,220
should stay appetite i mean it's more

974
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:12,180
that it makes more but to eat

975
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:14,259
taste like an ash yeah exactly yeah

976
00:32:14,259 --> 00:32:15,990
yeah yeah it's dated to smoke people

977
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:17,190
are more afraid that if they quit

978
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:18,480
they're gonna put on weight which is

979
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,250
true like you will as you need

980
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:21,630
to fill the hole

981
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:24,090
yoga your mouth but i but when

982
00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:25,980

sorry

986
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:35,460
it's just a classic joke structure i

987
00:32:35,730 --> 00:32:38,700
think absolutely i don't believe it um

988
00:32:39,330 --> 00:32:40,980
and i still gained weight i didn't

989
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:42,570
really yeah i still gained weight i

990
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:44,670
it's just ah ah ah wasn't gregory

00:32:54,690 --> 00:32:56,370
but quitting sm i think quitting smoking

994
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:59,700
because you everyone is told it's the

995
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:01,348
hardest thing to quit like yeah requip

996
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:02,820

to get rid of any character smoking

1075
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,920

1167
00:38:53,550 --> 00:38:55,140
to think of songs they can sing

1168
00:38:55,170 --> 00:38:57,630
only two lyrics of to be recognisable

1169
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:01,290

1170
00:39:01,290 --> 00:39:03,840
two words not to lyrics yeah two

1171
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,640
words well this was written by an

1172
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:06,450
idiot and

1173
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:08,760
this is a tale told by an

1174
00:39:08,790 --> 00:39:11,070
idiot full of sound and fury signifying

1175
00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:13,260
nothing we can't hate on paul for

1176
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:15,120
submitting this and paul is a great

1177
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:17,423
person and it was mountain and i

1178

i will always love you ground control

1179
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:22,230
it's like okay and i is much

1180
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:23,370
more than two notes that makes it

1181
00:39:23,370 --> 00:39:26,310
a good choice to lyrics not lie

1182
00:39:26,370 --> 00:39:27,600
too late to work too

1183
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:30,180
notes two words of the lyrics caveat

1184
00:39:30,270 --> 00:39:32,760
title lyrics are out you can't sing

1185
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:35,640
staying alive hey macarena white wedding that

1186
00:39:35,850 --> 00:39:38,370
apt for can probably go ah

1187
00:39:39,870 --> 00:39:42,000
yeah he says up your ugly guard

1188
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:46,560
again or the i from anti is

1189
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:47,614
in the title of i will always

1190
00:39:47,614 --> 00:39:49,080
love you i miss the point of

1191
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:52,140
the game be cool player poems as

1192
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:54,090
many songs as pay a bad amount

1193
00:39:54,090 --> 00:39:56,040
of time in x amount of time

1194
00:39:56,730 --> 00:39:58,050
each so we can say okay so

1195
00:39:58,050 --> 00:39:59,550
we basically took thirty seconds

1196
00:39:59,850 --> 00:40:02,100
each correct answer from other two players

1197
00:40:02,130 --> 00:40:03,540
earns a point i guess it could

1198
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:05,280
be a team game like pictionary but

1199
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,140
with these three two guessing honestly and

1200
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:08,910
for fun should work ok so let's

1201
00:40:08,910 --> 00:40:10,590
just do two guessing and one and

1202
00:40:10,590 --> 00:40:11,640
we'll just try guess we'll all just

1203
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:12,840
take it this means we can okay

1204
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,340

either

1206
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:18,600
it's hard to think of songs though

1207
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:21,420
so you'll see there's happy no that's

1208
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:23,610
