00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,890
it means to be an easy laughter

189
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:51,660
and why you consider yourself to be

190
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:54,270
one and then mourn and scott would

191
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:54,720
either have

192
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:57,360
you use that term to describe yourself

193
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,400
as an easy wow here's a good

194
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:02,460
question thanks i really like ever she

195
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:05,010

196
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,840
delaney i like a good name yeah

197
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,600
it's like dana delaney but backwards yeah

198
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:11,160
maybe your last name is dana with

199
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,350
no dana yeah yeah that's what that's

200
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:14,850
like

201
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,500
but we don't know their last name

202
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,760
is dana a good thing could be

203
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:21,180
delaney dana that would be delaying schama

204
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:23,578
dana that would be shocking i'm until

205
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:27,060
he made a bit um okay so

206
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:29,370
to me what an easy laffer means

207
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:33,900
is first of all i enjoy comedy

208
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:35,040
but

209
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:39,390
also i will laugh this is not

210
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:43,680
i will sometimes laugh not in a

211
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:45,750
professional capacity but in life

212
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,930
it's sometimes a laugh is people it's

213
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:50,790
just the intention of being funny you

214
00:07:50,790 --> 00:07:52,020
know what i mean yeah like when

215
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:53,370
you're out and about in the world

216
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:55,200
and somebody makes some little oh yeah

217
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:57,353
something and it's like even though the

218
00:07:57,353 --> 00:07:59,220
the joke itself is maybe not hilarious

219
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:01,110
but the idea that somebody's being kind

220
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:05,100
of um you know ah silly or

221
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,960
whatever that will i

222
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:08,640
i will enjoy that so it's like

223
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:11,070
it's weirdly like i'm laughing at the

224
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:12,870
intention of the person rather than what

225
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:14,520
they said now i think as a

226
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,090
woman

227
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:19,290
i'm not a woman you should okay

228
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:21,204
fine then i'll answer for myself no

229
00:08:21,204 --> 00:08:23,610
okay good i think as a woman

230
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:26,220
i um laugh when i don't mean

231
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:28,980
it a lot because now with my

232
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:31,080
friends like someone needs but no in

233
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,760
public you have to do that right

234
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:34,200
i mean you don't have to but

235
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,240
it's like we're ingrained with this i

236
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:36,480
think

237
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,460
to show that you're i'm just a

238
00:08:38,491 --> 00:08:40,320
nice shiny i mean i along with

239
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,730
it all and i don't mind that

240
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:43,500
you just made that comment i'm not

241
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:46,020
the biwa yeah in apartment twenty three

242
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:48,180
words i know but um so i

243
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:50,370
definitely put you polite laughter but i

244
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:54,480
think um with my friends i i

245
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,100
like to laugh a lot and then

246
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:56,640
but

247
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,590
if i'm watching something and i don't

248
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:00,120
think it's funny i don't really

249
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,540
yeah but it's it's not to be

250
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:05,190
rude it's just that i wait because

251
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:06,660
i'm gonna really is i'm like really

252
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:08,730
having fun like i went to see

253
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:11,700
we talked about this show gutenberg and

254
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:14,700
i was like laughing so hard and

255
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:15,840
it was like that's the best feeling

256
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:18,750
when you genuinely refined something so funny

257
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:20,550
that you're just like surprised by it

258
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:21,360
and the laugh is like

259
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:23,730
so authentic and i feel like for

260
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:26,850
me it's i i sort of just

261
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:28,530
like let it wash over me until

262
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:30,780
that happens i agree with that i

263
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:33,810
very rarely laugh at entertainment like like

264
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:35,520
a movie or tv show or something

265
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:37,230
so when it does make me laugh

266
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:40,050
out loud it's a huge thing yeah

267
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,280
wow that really caught me by far

268
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:41,460
like

269
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,840
i think you should leave or something

270
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:44,040
like yeah and then i'm just like

271
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,510
crying and i'm like that's the best

272
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:47,520
i get worried at live shows if

273
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,930
i go to see a friend show

274
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:52,260
because i i i have allowed laugh

275
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:53,700
and and to some people maybe a

276
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:57,930
distinctive laugh and i worry about ah

277
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,880
calling attention to myself yeah makes me

278
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,590
very self-conscious yeah and so

279
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:03,695
and i laugh and then i'll like

280
00:10:03,695 --> 00:10:05,045
stop myself when i think there's that

281
00:10:05,045 --> 00:10:06,905
thing too of like if you are

282
00:10:06,905 --> 00:10:08,015
laughing really hard something and then you're

283
00:10:08,015 --> 00:10:09,575
not then you stop yeah that's like

284
00:10:09,575 --> 00:10:10,745

00:11:20,465 --> 00:11:22,265
when i because i just had to

314
00:11:22,265 --> 00:11:23,675
be around it so much when hardy

315
00:11:23,675 --> 00:11:24,605
what it is i think it's a

316
00:11:24,605 --> 00:11:26,735
comedy fatigue yes yes so when i

317
00:11:26,735 --> 00:11:29,645
do see something that i really like

318
00:11:29,645 --> 00:11:31,475
a stand-up special that's super funny i'm

319
00:11:31,475 --> 00:11:33,995
like oh i can still laugh and

320
00:11:33,995 --> 00:11:36,275
santa yeah hey i had an experience

321
00:11:36,275 --> 00:11:36,935
recently

322
00:11:36,935 --> 00:11:38,855
the ah and i thought about it

323
00:11:39,305 --> 00:11:43,055
it really made me think about live

324
00:11:43,055 --> 00:11:45,155
performance i went to see a matinee

325
00:11:45,155 --> 00:11:47,195
of a play and there was a

326
00:11:47,195 --> 00:11:49,475
lot of humor in the play but

327
00:11:49,475 --> 00:11:50,825
because it was a matinee it was

328
00:11:50,825 --> 00:11:52,505
not hugely attended

329
00:11:53,825 --> 00:11:55,655
there were lines that you you you

330
00:11:55,655 --> 00:11:58,175
knew would usually get laughs yeah and

331
00:11:58,175 --> 00:11:59,555
weren't getting laughs and it's not that

332
00:11:59,555 --> 00:12:01,415
i didn't think they were funny but

333
00:12:01,415 --> 00:12:03,215
it is a different crowd was different

334
00:12:03,215 --> 00:12:04,985
women wow when you're in a crowd

335
00:12:04,985 --> 00:12:07,115
and it's that's why comedy films are

336
00:12:07,115 --> 00:12:08,404
so it's so important to watch with

337
00:12:08,404 --> 00:12:10,955
the crowd it was important because it

338
00:12:10,955 --> 00:12:13,235
just it just i mean i i

339
00:12:13,235 --> 00:12:13,895

i'd say you own your house yeah

365
00:13:04,985 --> 00:13:07,085
well sometimes i would see movies itself

366
00:13:07,085 --> 00:13:08,615
by southwest and they would just be

367
00:13:08,615 --> 00:13:10,687
so funny at south by southwest and

368
00:13:10,687 --> 00:13:12,065
then you'd tell people like oh go

369
00:13:12,095 --> 00:13:13,265
go see it and then you see

370
00:13:13,265 --> 00:13:14,795
it it's just not it's kind of

371
00:13:14,795 --> 00:13:17,015
laying there i was so relieved when

372
00:13:17,015 --> 00:13:17,495
i saw br

373
00:13:17,495 --> 00:13:19,325
kids maids maybe three weeks before it

374
00:13:19,325 --> 00:13:20,495
came out and i was coming back

375
00:13:20,495 --> 00:13:22,535
going dad everyone mean everyone will go

376
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:24,155
see brisbane and so we went to

377
00:13:24,155 --> 00:13:26,375
like opening night at the dome and

378
00:13:26,975 --> 00:13:29,915
um paul who directed was there actually

379
00:13:29,915 --> 00:13:31,205
and i was like oh hey here

380
00:13:31,205 --> 00:13:33,095
i am again i'm watching i brought

381
00:13:33,095 --> 00:13:34,565
all my friends and then it just

382
00:13:34,565 --> 00:13:36,725
kills you know yes just it's very

383
00:13:36,725 --> 00:13:37,655
gratifying that

384
00:13:37,655 --> 00:13:40,085
a movie i remember crying laugh like

385
00:13:40,115 --> 00:13:42,155
laughing till i cried and also crying

386
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:44,406
at the emotional thing only i love

387
00:13:44,406 --> 00:13:45,395
it i love to them but then

388
00:13:45,395 --> 00:13:47,615
like i would get sometimes going to

389
00:13:47,615 --> 00:13:49,685
the sunset five you'd get upset at

390
00:13:49,685 --> 00:13:51,875
the certain type of theatre goer yes

391
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:55,085
like doing performative laughing like i'm smart

392
00:13:55,085 --> 00:13:56,735
enough to get this joke but but

393
00:13:56,735 --> 00:13:57,635
at the same time like

394
00:13:57,965 --> 00:13:59,915
it is kind of a relationship especially

395
00:13:59,915 --> 00:14:01,835
in a live performance it's a relationship

396
00:14:01,835 --> 00:14:03,785
between you and the performer of like

397
00:14:04,355 --> 00:14:06,245
trying to give them what they yes

398
00:14:06,275 --> 00:14:08,135
i just i do feel if i'm

399
00:14:08,135 --> 00:14:10,445
watching a comedian or comedy show up

400
00:14:10,535 --> 00:14:13,895
in person i'm not withholding because i

401
00:14:13,895 --> 00:14:17,105
wanted to feel like yeah like gary

402
00:14:17,135 --> 00:14:17,934
we're here it's

403
00:14:18,005 --> 00:14:20,074
conversation between you and the performers something

404
00:14:20,074 --> 00:14:21,275
yes if it's a great way so

405
00:14:21,275 --> 00:14:22,625
i think like when we go out

406
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:23,915
on tour it's great to hear the

407
00:14:23,915 --> 00:14:26,375
laughs and it emboldens you and it's

408
00:14:26,375 --> 00:14:29,495
not performative yeah in in some ways

409
00:14:29,495 --> 00:14:31,505
but i don't know there are people

410
00:14:31,715 --> 00:14:32,825
i mean depends on what you're watching

411
00:14:32,825 --> 00:14:33,875
i think there's definitely those people where

412
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:36,455
they're laughing like huh i'm smart right

413
00:14:36,455 --> 00:14:38,045
but i would i would

414
00:14:38,135 --> 00:14:39,785
rather know as a performer i would

415
00:14:39,785 --> 00:14:41,465
rather that than people just sitting there

416
00:14:41,495 --> 00:14:43,235
going yeah show me something oh no

417
00:14:43,235 --> 00:14:45,215
no it's much nicer that people do

418
00:14:45,365 --> 00:14:47,075
like yeah but i went to a

419
00:14:47,405 --> 00:14:51,335
rather comedy show in london of someone

420
00:14:51,335 --> 00:14:52,715
who is very funny and

421
00:14:53,765 --> 00:14:55,265
i was listening to some podcast recently

422
00:14:55,265 --> 00:14:56,410
where they were talking about was it

423
00:14:56,465 --> 00:14:58,805
you talking this oh my god where

424
00:14:59,075 --> 00:14:59,705
he accused

425
00:15:01,085 --> 00:15:02,435
the london audiences don't really laugh but

426
00:15:02,435 --> 00:15:03,845
then they're like that was amazing ah

427
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:05,645
yes i was warned that before i

428
00:15:05,645 --> 00:15:07,205
went to yeah for the first time

429
00:15:07,235 --> 00:15:09,305
still very much more reserve was with

430
00:15:09,305 --> 00:15:11,315
my parents and this song i was

431
00:15:11,315 --> 00:15:15,095
there doing that movie and i might

432
00:15:15,128 --> 00:15:16,205
so my parents can visit me and

433
00:15:16,205 --> 00:15:18,155
we went to this standup or it

434
00:15:18,155 --> 00:15:19,655
was a storytelling show somebody that i

435
00:15:19,715 --> 00:15:21,095
really like and um

436
00:15:21,545 --> 00:15:23,675
the and but i felt crazy because

437
00:15:23,675 --> 00:15:25,595
i was like no one's laughing but

438
00:15:25,595 --> 00:15:27,095
my parents and i were laughing but

439
00:15:27,095 --> 00:15:28,775
it was like on like sort of

440
00:15:28,775 --> 00:15:30,752
like it what's i couldn't tell what

441
00:15:30,752 --> 00:15:32,585
was happening it was like it was

442
00:15:32,585 --> 00:15:34,235
actually a really weird feeling because i

443
00:15:34,235 --> 00:15:36,305
was like yo when you bring someone

444
00:15:36,305 --> 00:15:37,445
to something in your like i hope

445
00:15:37,445 --> 00:15:38,975
they like this yeah i'm going like

446
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:40,385
do they think this sucks because no

447
00:15:40,385 --> 00:15:41,255
one's laughing but it's like

448
00:15:41,285 --> 00:15:42,965
but it is entertaining and i'm like

449
00:15:43,085 --> 00:15:43,865
and then they they did have a

450
00:15:43,865 --> 00:15:44,825
good time but it was just like

451
00:15:44,915 --> 00:15:48,065
so if laughter is truly involuntary than

452
00:15:48,065 --> 00:15:49,955
why would it be a cultural thing

453
00:15:49,985 --> 00:15:51,785
if people don't laugh

454
00:15:53,165 --> 00:15:54,365
did that make do that thank you

455
00:15:54,365 --> 00:15:57,815
fall asleep because i launched so rich

456
00:15:58,355 --> 00:15:59,615
but you know what i mean like

457
00:15:59,705 --> 00:16:00,995
like i don't know i just laughed

458
00:16:00,995 --> 00:16:02,765
i hold ever really known that about

459
00:16:02,945 --> 00:16:03,935
and then i had i don't know

460
00:16:03,935 --> 00:16:05,045
if you said it or somebody else

461
00:16:05,045 --> 00:16:06,185
said it but i was like oh

462
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:07,445
maybe that made me think of that

463
00:16:07,445 --> 00:16:09,035
experience i was like oh is that

464
00:16:09,035 --> 00:16:10,685
what happened there like it was like

465
00:16:11,525 --> 00:16:13,175
the maybe they're being respectful or

466
00:16:13,205 --> 00:16:14,705
like taking it in a different way

467
00:16:14,705 --> 00:16:16,745
no laughter no it wasn't but but

468
00:16:16,745 --> 00:16:19,025
it was it was it wasn't enthusiastic

469
00:16:19,025 --> 00:16:21,335
laugh it was quiet yeah yeah yeah

470
00:16:21,875 --> 00:16:25,205
i mean culturally and it was sold

471
00:16:25,205 --> 00:16:26,435
out like if like they were excited

472
00:16:26,435 --> 00:16:27,635
to be yeah that's like row

473
00:16:29,285 --> 00:16:30,695
as a row fill right out oh

474
00:16:30,713 --> 00:16:33,065
yeah i think that yeah i know

475
00:16:33,455 --> 00:16:35,039
i know i think that we both

476
00:16:35,045 --> 00:16:36,275
know i think

477
00:16:38,405 --> 00:16:41,645
i think that ah culturally it makes

478
00:16:41,645 --> 00:16:44,975
sense if you know expression of emotion

479
00:16:45,425 --> 00:16:47,465
is so the is suppressed is more

480
00:16:47,465 --> 00:16:50,855
private yeah yeah and so you're just

481
00:16:50,855 --> 00:16:52,625
it's just ingrained in you let be

482
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:54,455
such a bummer to grow up with

483
00:16:54,515 --> 00:16:56,045
parents who don't laugh at anything you

484
00:16:56,045 --> 00:16:57,545
do or yeah

485
00:16:57,605 --> 00:16:59,872
would it yeah wonder what that yeah

486
00:17:00,605 --> 00:17:01,835
i wonder if it would have driven

487
00:17:01,835 --> 00:17:04,265
me to show oh that's right

488
00:17:05,765 --> 00:17:07,115
think about the other side of it

489
00:17:07,445 --> 00:17:09,515
where i genuinely laugh at everything that

490
00:17:09,515 --> 00:17:11,075
