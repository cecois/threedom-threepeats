was a fine comedian what have you

59
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:27,420
in the eighties and then he had

60
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:28,710
that talk show where he would ask

61
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:30,510
leading questions of comedians and then he

62
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:31,860
bought the weather channel well where do

63
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,210
you get all the money before then

64
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:34,290
he was on a show called real

65
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:36,390
people real people right yeah it was

66
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:38,910
um a sort of it was like

67
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:40,110
that segment at the end of the

68
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:41,700
local news but a whole

69
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,560
our of that where it's like here's

70
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,930
a weirdo who does a weird thing

71
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,330
i told the story questions wait one

72
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,430
wasn't it like a pretty low amount

73
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:51,690
that he paid for the weather channel

74
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:52,980
like more than like less than you

75
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:54,690
would think a channel would cost you

76
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:56,010
to have lapsed into the public domain

77
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:59,280
yeah watch the other queen who watches

78
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,229
the weather why do you want the

79
00:03:01,229 --> 00:03:01,800
watchman

80
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:04,140
why do you want to own that

81
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,730
what do you get from that i

82
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:07,800
don't understand well why would anyone created

83
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,110
if there's nothing i don't know are

84
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:10,830
they selling it

85
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,920
um no but i told a story

86
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,390
about real people on r e m

87
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:17,490

88
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:20,280
ah paul just got some startling new

89
00:03:20,502 --> 00:03:21,510
that had to put on his john

90
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:24,780
lennon says huh that here's what's embarrassing

91
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:27,120
imo i'm at this new i'm at

92
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,590
the point where said the studio's dark

93
00:03:28,688 --> 00:03:30,750
spontaneous nation lighting which is the nicest

94
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,160
podcast lighting and

95
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,710
and so live-in chef kevin handed me

96
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:36,000
his phone where he looked up how

97
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,250
much byron allen bought the weather channel

98
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:40,920
four oh and i'm at an age

99
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:44,250
now where in this somewhat darkened room

100
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,870
and with maybe the screen not turned

101
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:47,010
all the way up to it's maximum

102
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:49,290
brightness united ten upgrade that i need

103
00:03:49,292 --> 00:03:50,310
to put on my glasses the only

104
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:51,960
glasses i would see on my prescription

105
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,320
sunglass

106
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:55,140
houses so i look like a weirdo

107
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:57,330
um who just needs to read good

108
00:03:57,330 --> 00:03:59,760
oldies to look cool to read something

109
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:01,830
i have to have my old dade

110
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:05,130
three hundred million dollars of his own

111
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:07,260
dollars and that's i don't know like

112
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:09,000
that's a lot of money obviously but

113
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,590
to me that sounds like oh i

114
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:11,940
wouldn't think you could get it for

115
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:12,390
that

116
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:14,040
little like i mean i would think

117
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:14,872
it would have to be more than

118
00:04:14,872 --> 00:04:16,530
i guess although when you consider like

119
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:19,020
the like star wars was a billion

120
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:20,880
that's a third of star wars the

121
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,160
weather channel yeah i guess that's where

122
00:04:23,165 --> 00:04:23,700
you know

123
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,130
a hundred million yeah i guess it's

124
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:27,600
like like all you need to do

125
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,580
is create three weather channels and you've

126
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:31,920
created star wars yeah do you think

127
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:33,270
she's trying to do i think he

128
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:35,040
might be doing it the weather channel

129
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:36,870
for starts putting on his own shows

130
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:38,940
and they're like silly and there's like

131
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:41,280
droids in them what if he starts

132
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:43,230
lying about what the weather is oh

133
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:44,760
my god do we trust byron allen

134
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:44,880

135
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,950

137
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:50,790
soothing like in the morning it was

138
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,710

139
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:54,240

170
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:55,980

chef but google little chef um wow

175
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,240
one i always think when i when

176
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,200
i was growing up i would watch

177
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,700
the traffic thing and i was so

178
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:13,680
confused like who is going from that

179
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,870
specific okay because i'd be like to

180
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,820
to o'hare or something why are you

181
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:19,350
going to o'hare and you know that

182
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:20,940
but i never understood that you would

183
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:22,890
deduct like oh i'm generally going over

184
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:24,600
there so it'll take forty minutes from

185
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:26,460
where you wondered why anyone would ever

186
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:27,806
go to o'hare well because

187

like and they use the whole thing

620
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:02,511
which is really confusing when you're watching

621
00:22:02,511 --> 00:22:03,440
you kind of do need that and

622
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,520

it's

630
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:15,680
raised so strange were there's still pictures

631
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,480
of the seaver family on the wall

632
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:19,430
you know if they turn backwards like

633
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,260
you can't look at this super family

634
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:23,360
no but it made no sense it

635
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,310
was just just felt uncomfortable because they're

636
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:27,530
like they're in the different house what

637
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:31,100
a strange yeah but but it's so

638
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,810
crazy because back in those days i

639
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:33,260
feel like

640
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:35,030
the networks used to spend even more

641
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:36,920
money on things why wouldn't they just

642
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:38,870
write well the set for the show

643
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:39,950
and they kept like i think they

644
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:41,690
were really trying to make it work

645
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:44,990
by bringing all these actors or designers

646
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:46,400
i just burped

647
00:22:47,815 --> 00:22:49,970
it would my tim gunn impression make

648
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:53,060
you burp yeah right to know why

649
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:54,380

650
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:55,310

happy days i watched that and then

673
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:33,170
i had this thing where anything i

674
00:23:33,170 --> 00:23:34,910
ever watched a movie a tv show

675
00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:36,260

with my mom going shopping or whatever

677
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:40,130
i would i would do the plot

and just explain every single thing that

679
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:43,430
happened i i'm sure it must have

680
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:45,200
taken longer than the twenty two minutes

681
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:46,640
no doubt that it actually was yeah

682
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:47,900
and we were in a grocery

683
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:49,490
a store or a hardware storage feels

684
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:50,630
like a hardware store i don't know

685
00:23:50,650 --> 00:23:53,120
for some reason and detail and i

686
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,250
was and i finally got to the

687
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:56,450
end and i was like i was

688
00:23:56,450 --> 00:23:58,250
doing every joke that robin williams made

689
00:23:58,250 --> 00:23:59,300
like and then he's like none who

690
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:03,140
knew which means this country and and

691
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:07,550
my mom is paying the cashier and

692
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:08,030
the cash

693
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:09,950
here's like looks like someone is a

694
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:12,980
big happy days fan and i felt

695
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:14,930
like it was condescending in some way

696
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:16,795
and i felt embarrassed you should have

697
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,030
that is me and i want adults

698
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:21,890
her children like that no but it's

699
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,570
what they're trying to be oh she's

700
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:24,800
trying to just include me of like

701
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:26,480
hey looks like so much but it

702
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,250
was almost like oh i know what

703
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:30,200
you're doing you're trying to you're trying

704
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,520
to this is how i felt this

705
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,660
is not how no no but that

706
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:33,620
is how you feel as a kid

707
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:34,790
oh i see what you're trying to

708
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:36,740
do you're trying to co-opt happy days

709
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:38,060
which is like real artist

710
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:39,170
it's doing a new you're trying to

711
00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:40,670
be as cool as happy days no

712
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:41,960
i know what you're doing you're doing

713
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,250
happy days you're just doing the plot

714
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:45,200
of happy days well that when you're

715
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:46,970
you really never let it go that

716
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:49,760
that the occur tone that that grown

717
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,140
ups will use when you're a kid

718
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,320
it yeah it is not you always

719
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,060
know that it's condescending i but see

720
00:24:56,090 --> 00:24:58,220
here's the thing i i've never

721
00:24:58,220 --> 00:24:59,210
vw is i don't know if you

722
00:24:59,210 --> 00:25:01,707
guys met him little chi and i've

723
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,710
met kai and i haven't met him

724
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:05,060
but i saw his signs leading to

725
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:07,550
his layer he's an exciting little fellow

726
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:10,610
he loves to dress his spider-man um

727
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:13,880
and i i hating that tone i

728
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:14,900
always talked to him like hey kai

729
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:16,460
how are you how are young fellow

730
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:17,480
what's going on blah blah blah you

731
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,380
know i talked to him like this

732
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:19,910
yeah and cool ups like why don't

733
00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:21,110
you talk to him like you know

734
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:22,520
be nicer to him or something like

735
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:24,890
i guess the baseline for all adults

736
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:26,570
talking to any kid is like hi

737
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,850
how are you what's a weird and

738
00:25:28,850 --> 00:25:29,750
you talked to him like a guy

739
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:30,920
that you share an office with

740
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,620
do you mind give me a little

741
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,720
top-off on this coffee i think kids

742
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:36,860
like when you talk to them like

743
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:38,870
they're your save me i think so

744
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:41,000
too that's how i feel don't don't

745
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,710
like it when you do in no

746
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:43,700
way does make them feel like you

747
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:45,080
don't care about kids or something but

748
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,160
like when i was a babysitter i

749
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:48,470
didn't talk to them like like they're

750
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:50,030
like that baby voice or something it's

751
00:25:50,030 --> 00:25:51,020
like you just said we've gotta go

752
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:51,920
let's do it you know it's like

753
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:52,220
and

754
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:54,530
most parents don't do that to their

755
00:25:54,530 --> 00:25:56,000
kids i think it's kind of weird

756
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,800
one parents always talk in a baby

757
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,120
voice to their kid to their own

758
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,980
kids yeah but then parents who don't

759
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:02,000
talk in a baby voice to their

760
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,440
own kids go over and meet someone

761
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,300
else's kids and then it goes yes

762
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:07,760
law because they can't they're like they

763
00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:09,740

i'm gonna start it on the news

949
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:28,744
it's like solid base just meat and

950
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,930
i'm gonna roll up from there but

951
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,430
i love like the view i love

952
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:33,749
those kinds of shit right i can

953
00:32:33,749 --> 00:32:34,800
watch the view every day and i

954
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,210
did for years but

955
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,340
i don't haven't done it lately but

956
00:32:38,550 --> 00:32:39,840
i think it's would you like to

957
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,250
host the view i actually think i

958
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:42,690
would have fun doing something like that

959
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,100
i think i would but i would

960
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:46,620
have to it wouldn't be now but

961
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:49,320
later what i mean yeah oils are

962
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:50,820
right now but like i imagine like

963
00:32:50,850 --> 00:32:53,070
oh like when i'm like fifty i

964
00:32:53,079 --> 00:32:54,630
can look over the hill when you

965
00:32:54,630 --> 00:32:56,220
feel old enough to start lecturing people

966
00:32:57,609 --> 00:32:59,910
i'd be like i have opinions because

967
00:32:59,910 --> 00:33:02,430
of my life experience should be the

968
00:33:02,430 --> 00:33:04,890
young when you get older you'll understand

969
00:33:04,890 --> 00:33:06,360
that the world works in a different

970
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:07,950
way than you think it does yeah

971
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,720
well the young people they have now

972
00:33:09,930 --> 00:33:12,240
like meghan mccain who's like she's really

973
00:33:12,330 --> 00:33:14,730
she's put very politically savvy though where

974
00:33:14,730 --> 00:33:16,500
i'm like she brings something specific i'd

975
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:16,860
bring the ca

976
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:17,130
comedy

977
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:20,490

1181
00:40:10,770 --> 00:40:11,910
and then i realized you were joking

1182
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:14,340
i'm actually not bart is the hottest

1183
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:16,890
character please if i had to okay

1184
00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:20,130
he's forty now or how long has

1185
00:40:20,130 --> 00:40:22,890
he been around wealthy well nineteen eighty

1186
00:40:22,890 --> 00:40:25,290
nine so so you consider even though

1187
00:40:25,290 --> 00:40:26,460
other show he is still

1188
00:40:26,490 --> 00:40:28,440
a child you're thinking because the show

you had to fuck a dog what

1218
00:41:35,595 --> 00:41:36,495

it would have to be a cartoon

1220
00:41:37,815 --> 00:41:39,015

1228
00:41:55,725 --> 00:41:57,465
if anyone cares out there but it's

1229
00:41:57,525 --> 00:41:59,445
jon kimberlin and paul rust and then

1230
00:41:59,445 --> 00:42:00,015
gambling is

1231
00:42:00,015 --> 00:42:01,785
like arguing for fuck for like oh

1232
00:42:01,815 --> 00:42:03,345
no this was this was off of

1233
00:42:03,405 --> 00:42:05,085
improper humans yes i said i was

1234
00:42:05,085 --> 00:42:06,885
and i was i was listening okay

1235
00:42:06,915 --> 00:42:11,625
great and ouch ah but it's ah

1236
00:42:11,685 --> 00:42:13,365
kind of crazy to watch him argue

1237
00:42:13,365 --> 00:42:15,405
for it it's john emily's arguing for

1238
00:42:15,405 --> 00:42:18,915
beast yeah what what sparked this debate

1239
00:42:19,035 --> 00:42:19,635
ah

1240
00:42:20,175 --> 00:42:21,759
i don't know probably just something who

1241
00:42:21,759 --> 00:42:23,655
want to talk about it might have

1242
00:42:23,655 --> 00:42:25,694
been in the scene or something god

1243
00:42:25,694 --> 00:42:26,745
i hope so i think but i

1244
00:42:26,745 --> 00:42:29,145
think the conversation was not it was

1245
00:42:29,145 --> 00:42:31,125
like i mean in a sense it's

1246
00:42:31,125 --> 00:42:33,285
better than like a dildo because a

1247
00:42:33,288 --> 00:42:36,345
dildo cannot give consent a living wage

1248
00:42:36,765 --> 00:42:39,435
a living being can give consent we

1249
00:42:39,435 --> 00:42:40,305
just don't know whether

1250
00:42:40,335 --> 00:42:42,345
they are giving consent so that but

1251
00:42:42,345 --> 00:42:44,205
the possibilities are fifty fifty they're giving

1252
00:42:44,205 --> 00:42:46,875
consent meanwhile a dildo is not giving

1253
00:42:46,905 --> 00:42:48,045
cause i still do is made to

1254
00:42:48,045 --> 00:42:53,115
give consent oh slavery slavery steely dan

1255
00:42:54,435 --> 00:42:57,015

1409
00:49:13,095 --> 00:49:15,075
because the larry king whatever we should

1410
00:49:15,075 --> 00:49:16,155
have said is do you want to

1411
00:49:16,155 --> 00:49:18,495
see a show where the performers shit

1412
00:49:18,495 --> 00:49:20,745
all the time and their horses yeah

1413
00:49:20,805 --> 00:49:22,965
well yeah you know how some shows

1414
00:49:22,965 --> 00:49:24,735
keep you awake not this show

1415
00:49:24,735 --> 00:49:26,325
yo i make you go right tonight

1416
00:49:26,325 --> 00:49:28,065
night the rhythm of the horses we

1417
00:49:28,065 --> 00:49:29,265
had a good time watching though i

1418
00:49:29,265 --> 00:49:30,705
will sigh but it makes you go

1419
00:49:30,705 --> 00:49:34,665
nice expensive um bones i mean i

1420
00:49:34,665 --> 00:49:38,295
guess to some people don't wow i

1421
00:49:38,295 --> 00:49:39,615
heard about it on a podcast that

1422
00:49:39,615 --> 00:49:41,505
someone was saying it costs like three

1423
00:49:41,505 --> 00:49:43,125
hundred dollars a ticket that's no i

1424
00:49:43,155 --> 00:49:44,775
definitely know because i would not have

1425
00:49:44,775 --> 00:49:44,865
been

1426
00:49:44,985 --> 00:49:46,545
i heard it costs a bucket of

1427
00:49:46,605 --> 00:49:49,950
oats is that not true yes we

1428
00:49:49,965 --> 00:49:52,028
need the performance i mean like it

1429
00:49:52,028 --> 00:49:54,495
was produced by horse's name so i

1430
00:49:54,495 --> 00:49:55,965
think it'll be like one person sings

1431
00:49:55,965 --> 00:49:57,375
and i think we're all good singers

1432
00:49:57,375 --> 00:49:58,545
and this is gonna be easier as

1433
00:49:58,905 --> 00:50:00,345
i think so too and so we're

1434
00:50:00,345 --> 00:50:01,845
kind of competing it would be two

1435
00:50:01,845 --> 00:50:03,135
people competing yeah sure we chose to

1436
00:50:03,135 --> 00:50:04,635
be dewey or should we do it

1437
00:50:04,635 --> 00:50:05,055
for time

1438
00:50:05,055 --> 00:50:07,395
mm so everyone's competing for the shortest

1439
00:50:07,395 --> 00:50:07,875
time

1440
00:50:09,075 --> 00:50:10,635
i think it amounts to the same

1441
00:50:10,635 --> 00:50:13,005
thing what if we time it and

1442
00:50:13,005 --> 00:50:14,535
then we each get points for how

1443
00:50:14,595 --> 00:50:18,375
like i'd say i'm guessing and then

1444
00:50:18,405 --> 00:50:20,385
we have a minute and you were

1445
00:50:20,385 --> 00:50:21,675
with hugo then you go then you

1446
00:50:21,675 --> 00:50:23,625
go and whoever gets more out that

1447
00:50:23,625 --> 00:50:24,555
doesn't take so long

1448
00:50:25,725 --> 00:50:27,435
whoever guy more out that doesn't take

1449
00:50:27,435 --> 00:50:29,445
so i think it's easier if we

1450
00:50:29,445 --> 00:50:30,825
both try to get like if paul's

1451
00:50:30,825 --> 00:50:32,385
doing it we both try to guess

1452
00:50:32,385 --> 00:50:33,735
and paul is competing for the shortest

1453
00:50:33,735 --> 00:50:35,805
time god okay okay okay wait i'm

1454
00:50:35,805 --> 00:50:37,335
committed oh ty is where think you

1455
00:50:37,335 --> 00:50:39,315
want so i want to replicate it

1456
00:50:39,345 --> 00:50:41,235
as as always sleeping awesome you would

1457
00:50:41,235 --> 00:50:43,245
sing poorly and just stretch the timeline

1458
00:50:43,275 --> 00:50:44,655
forever which i think everyone knows i

1459
00:50:44,655 --> 00:50:45,585
can't you cannot do

1460
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:48,150
yeah i pulled out my calculator app

1461
00:50:49,860 --> 00:50:52,260
yeah my my delight by one plus

1462
