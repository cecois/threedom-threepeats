mistakes when you accidentally go to a

63
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:28,170

189
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:02,640
that full

190
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,410

192
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:08,970
he held a row he knew it

193
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,800
was a funny scene though wasn't a

194
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,570
sex scene when she's fully know she's

195
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,730
in a sensory deprivation tank and then

196
00:07:14,850 --> 00:07:17,370
you see her footboard and he he

197
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:18,960
was doing that happened to him getting

198
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,730
the sailing in his eye right and

199
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:22,800
then he asked her would you be

200
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,000
eat fully naked for this because it's

201
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,740
funnier if you're fully naked and she

202
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:26,760
was down and then they were like

203
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,810
you know that's twenty five years of

204
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:29,490
trust from working together for so long

205
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,200
i was like i get that i

206
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,580
thought that was good and it was

207
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:33,540
funny or that she was naked if

208
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:35,280
she was in her bikini or something

209
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,810
i wouldn't have been asked it was

210
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:39,690
funnier but not that necessary it's not

211
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,610
necessary yeah yeah no it's not necessary

212
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:42,960
it was because it was now

213
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,460
not a plot point no it was

214
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:46,495
just a version seen although jamie and

215
00:07:46,495 --> 00:07:47,820
i talked about this she's getting to

216
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:50,460
be funny so far in the season

217
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:51,960
yeah way that she was not allowed

218
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,250
to because it wasn't lasting i don't

219
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:54,330
know that much about it but it

220
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:55,920
wasn't last season a drag or something

221
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:57,090
well i loved it but it was

222
00:07:57,090 --> 00:07:58,380
like she's going through her divorce and

223
00:07:58,380 --> 00:07:59,400
all this stuff and so it's like

224
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,470
very she doesn't have as much fun

225
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,120
this is a more fun light hearted

226
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,800
it isn't fair we did talk about

227
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:08,700
how the there were things in the

228
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:12,540
previously on that absolutely did not matter

229
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:13,830
i didn't remember any second up to

230
00:08:13,837 --> 00:08:15,810
say i was shocked and then and

231
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:17,370
then there were things in the episode

232
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:19,350
that was like oh right she was

233
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:21,300
an alcoholic like that they did not

234
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:23,070
think why didn't they put them in

235
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:23,280
the re

236
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,440
recap yes exactly they don't kept talking

237
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,367
about the met ball and and making

238
00:08:27,367 --> 00:08:28,800
you think like okay this episode is

239
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,750
gonna start that high notions you've happened

240
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:34,050
yeah you're thinking of the met gala

241
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,450
oh yeah are those two different things

242
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,730
will know the map ball or the

243
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:39,960
mets in charge of one of these

244
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:41,280
i think it's the same thing but

245
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,679
i think what they what it was

246
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,440
that they only went to the

247
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,270
the party portion leading go on the

248
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,040
red carpet oh is the guy yeah

249
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,080
the distinction i think that guy includes

250
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,210
the carpet and the party i just

251
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:52,320
don't know i just i think it's

252
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,450
called the ultimate vp but show i've

253
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:56,160
never heard met ball in my life

254
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:58,860
maybe they can't say my god oh

255
00:08:58,890 --> 00:08:59,968
yeah it's like it's like when you

256
00:08:59,968 --> 00:09:01,170
talk but even for bullets like the

257
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:03,540
big game yeah you

258
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,070
can't say that and say the super

259
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:06,390
bowl yeah that's so like i said

260
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:07,560
it's just a thing in the world

261
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:09,930
unless you have a deal with them

262
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:11,730
where you're the official chip or whatever

263
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:12,870
of it you have to be like

264
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:14,370
hey you ready for the big game

265
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:16,980
on sunday i'm sorry that's bizarre because

266
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:18,120
i think super bowl is just a

267
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,040
word transcendent like yeah just watch the

268
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:23,010

272
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:31,080

for my brother's wife's baby shower years

450
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,370
ago others speak wow it was his

451
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:38,470
and hers but i ran some games

452
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:40,480
for it yeah my quarterly you gotta

453
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,770
run relay race and one of them

454
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:43,120
was to drink out of a bottle

455
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,824
as fast as you can and my

456
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:47,080
remember my dad brother having to do

457
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,310
it and it was like is it

458
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:48,850
really hot

459
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:50,350
hard because like it's doesn't come out

460
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:52,180
quickly right and so it was like

461
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:53,560
kind of like they're both getting headaches

462
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,939
i was like this is like an

463
00:15:54,939 --> 00:15:57,040
insane game oh babies do it

464
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:00,880
so trying to chug it was a

465
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,620
psychotic game and it was really funny

466
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,000
does that mean that babies are just

467
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,640
like taking their time when they're drinking

468
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,870
out of a bottle i mean i

469
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:09,430
mean that's a problem with ami's she

470
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:11,770
always wants to gulp everything so like

471
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:14,770
with her water bottle or nipple ah

472
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:17,650
no now she's okay with the milk

473
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:17,860
but

474
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:20,920
jeans it's actually with wildly different hole

475
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:23,590
sizes be right yeah yeah we we

476
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:27,130
had to expand it ah yeah when

477
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:29,350
when she's really young it's really tiny

478
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:30,700
and then you know but there was

479
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:31,750
a time when she was like gulping

480
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:33,910
down eleven ounces would just like in

481
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:36,400
three minutes bubbled up up but now

482
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,660
with a why would she show up

483
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:38,200
no

484
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:40,180
oh no she just loves me but

485
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:41,590
you know now with the water it's

486
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:43,810
like she loved to eat she loves

487
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:46,180
it the water she loves water and

488
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:49,000

00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:52,000
down her

491
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:54,850

504
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:15,580
kind of like what's up like let's

why don't you put some gray makeup

507
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:19,180

in a ditch oh yeah there's i

512
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:31,660
said about scientists they intentionally live far

513
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:33,040
away from the lab so they can

514
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,260

the phrase weddings yeah i was what

944
00:32:44,315 --> 00:32:45,150

my thumb up my ass yeah like

946
00:32:46,715 --> 00:32:47,705
like i was thinking it's kind of

947
00:32:47,705 --> 00:32:49,985
a funny phrase like um if you're

948
00:32:50,015 --> 00:32:51,665
like i made a start i made

949
00:32:51,665 --> 00:32:52,685
up a whole scenario my head on

950
00:32:52,685 --> 00:32:54,065
the way here of like what would

951
00:32:54,065 --> 00:32:55,925
be funny if someone was like oh

952
00:32:55,925 --> 00:32:56,375
do you go to

953
00:32:56,405 --> 00:32:58,175
the that birthday party of someone you

954
00:32:58,175 --> 00:32:59,855
hate or whatever and then i know

955
00:32:59,855 --> 00:33:00,665
like what do you do instead i

956
00:33:00,665 --> 00:33:01,565
sat at home with my thumb up

957
00:33:01,565 --> 00:33:02,855
my ass and i was like that's

958
00:33:03,215 --> 00:33:05,375
kind of like it's a really harsh

959
00:33:05,645 --> 00:33:07,985
thing to say it's usually it's directed

960
00:33:07,985 --> 00:33:09,330
at other people it's like you're like

961
00:33:09,330 --> 00:33:10,895
sitting around your thumb but i thought

962
00:33:10,895 --> 00:33:12,335
it was funny to say might yourself

963
00:33:12,365 --> 00:33:13,865
like weird how much you didn't want

964
00:33:13,865 --> 00:33:15,185
to go to the stage to take

965
00:33:15,185 --> 00:33:16,415
ownership of it yeah

966
00:33:18,035 --> 00:33:19,655
instead i chose to put my thumb

967
00:33:19,655 --> 00:33:20,915
up my ass like i so didn't

968
00:33:20,915 --> 00:33:23,585

00:40:09,065 --> 00:40:10,325
of his movies and then i also

1183
00:40:10,325 --> 00:40:11,853

1185
00:40:12,845 --> 00:40:15,305

bag if anything if anything not rowley

1187
00:40:18,365 --> 00:40:19,715
i would also i thought well i

1188
00:40:19,715 --> 00:40:21,005
think black death you shouldn't have a

1189
00:40:21,005 --> 00:40:22,655
camera to that he liked webs to

1190
00:40:22,655 --> 00:40:24,065
the wall that takes pictures of everything

1191
00:40:24,065 --> 00:40:25,985
yeah daily bugle yeah sure there should

1192
00:40:25,985 --> 00:40:27,275
also be a j jonah jameson who

1193
00:40:27,275 --> 00:40:28,715
comes in and say i'm gonna get

1194
00:40:28,715 --> 00:40:31,805
pictures reveal you're a menace um the

1195
00:40:31,805 --> 00:40:32,855
the spiderman should have

1196
00:40:33,530 --> 00:40:36,020
looks like a web which spiderman would

1197
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:38,540
sometimes do something like that would be

1198
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,280
not a little pink suitcase because it

1199
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:42,470
makes you have too many questions but

1200
00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:43,790
did the kids have any questions or

1201
00:40:43,790 --> 00:40:44,900
did they just see it and get

1202
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:46,400
it i think that they were fine

1203
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,900
in general but i think i don't

1204
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,580
i don't know what the actual reaction

1205
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:50,480

1206
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,710

all of it um you know it's

1367
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:54,560
a tough situation wherein because i think

1368
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:56,540
we moved on and we said reggie

1369
00:46:56,540 --> 00:46:58,640
miller and then we home did pass

1370
00:46:58,820 --> 00:47:00,320
but i but it sounds like she

1371
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:01,580
was trying to find us during that

1372
00:47:01,580 --> 00:47:02,896
time and so that's really frustrating we're

1373
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:03,980
gonna have to talk about this author

1374
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:05,793
yea we're gonna have a group of

1375
00:47:05,830 --> 00:47:08,270
the top maitre amazing to hear from

00:47:08,270 --> 00:47:10,119

1378
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:13,430
really great gift yeah it's really delightful

1379
00:47:13,850 --> 00:47:15,410
of credit so i hear from her

1380
00:47:15,410 --> 00:47:17,540
and it's great to see her i

1381
00:47:17,540 --> 00:47:20,360
was i enjoy broadway's own paige davis

1382
00:47:21,290 --> 00:47:22,670
when that was credible that was so

1383
00:47:22,670 --> 00:47:24,140
cool very cool of her

1384
00:47:24,140 --> 00:47:26,000
survey that was maybe the first time

1385
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,440
i've understood why cameo cameos cool

1386
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:29,780
not because of me

1387
00:47:32,270 --> 00:47:33,290
that was the best cameo i could

1388
00:47:33,290 --> 00:47:34,550
have received is how i should have

1389
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:36,110
rated for that one though i do

1390
00:47:36,110 --> 00:47:37,820
want one philly bano should do cameo

1391
00:47:38,780 --> 00:47:41,420
why be funny he has no reason

1392
00:47:41,420 --> 00:47:43,490
why it's okay do you feel like

1393
00:47:43,490 --> 00:47:44,900
they would be sure to be inundated

1394
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:46,280
he'd haven't had ever people i know

1395
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:47,300
but you feel like they'd be thirty

1396
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:50,210
seconds or they'd be ten ten ten

1397
00:47:50,210 --> 00:47:51,020
minutes add

1398
00:47:51,020 --> 00:47:53,030
and but but i feel like to

1399
00:47:53,030 --> 00:47:55,190
weed out unserious people you'd have to

1400
00:47:55,190 --> 00:47:57,200
charge like ten thousand dollars a cameo

1401
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:58,850
forum but do you think you would

1402
00:47:58,850 --> 00:48:01,790
ever include phrases like world just people

1403
00:48:03,650 --> 00:48:04,850
like at some point that comes up

1404
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:07,520

we would have to explain the concept

00:49:35,150 --> 00:49:36,350
of pittsburgh's to her and that would

1439
00:49:36,350 --> 00:49:38,690
be directly for me it's too embarrassing

1440
00:49:38,690 --> 00:49:41,180
to explain the why the family chose

1441
00:49:41,180 --> 00:49:42,860

1450
00:49:58,940 --> 00:50:00,350
see this but nevertheless i wanted to

1451
00:50:00,350 --> 00:50:01,670
ask if you had any idea where

1452
00:50:01,670 --> 00:50:04,100
i could stream bajillion dollar properties because

1453
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:05,630
i want to watch it so bad

1454
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:07,790

1455
00:50:07,790 --> 00:50:09,740
paying per episode or season

even willing to pay per season that

1460
00:50:21,290 --> 00:50:22,400
to me doesn't make any sense like

1461
00:50:22,431 --> 00:50:23,690
just get it all at once for

1462
00:50:23,690 --> 00:50:25,880
a bulk price so crazy however much

1463
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:28,820
just is like everything should be free

1464
00:50:28,820 --> 00:50:30,410
all the time there's a lot of

1465
00:50:30,410 --> 00:50:31,580
that i mean we're not really horrible

1466
00:50:31,580 --> 00:50:34,520
time with so many streamers and services

1467
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:35,810
that like you have to have it

1468
00:50:35,810 --> 00:50:36,860
to spend younger

1469
00:50:37,534 --> 00:50:38,460
love them like it doesn't make any

1470
00:50:38,460 --> 00:50:40,800
sense i will say i recently got

1471
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:42,210
rid of cable and i now only

1472
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:44,010
use hulu live and i'm pretty excited

1473
00:50:44,010 --> 00:50:44,940
to take me one hundred dollars a

1474
00:50:44,940 --> 00:50:46,429
month when i figured out the math

1475
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:47,670
and i have it no

1476
00:50:48,810 --> 00:50:50,730
you actually can't share it because no

1477
00:50:50,730 --> 00:50:53,880
no guys one hundred dollars oh well

1478
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:55,650
i'm saving it now no but can

1479
00:50:55,650 --> 00:50:57,540
i have it no i'm saving it

1480
00:50:57,660 --> 00:50:59,550
for something really special are you really

1481
00:50:59,550 --> 00:51:00,450
because i want to have twelve hundred

1482
00:51:00,450 --> 00:51:02,250
dollars a year now because i'm not

1483
00:51:02,250 --> 00:51:03,750
spending that same for how many years

1484
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:07,290
forever so i'm now probably never get

1485
00:51:07,290 --> 00:51:08,940
it again so say

1486
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:10,350
say like how many more years do

1487
00:51:10,350 --> 00:51:12,420
you think you'll be alive i'll be

1488
00:51:12,420 --> 00:51:15,780
alive sixty maybe i hope so okay

1489
00:51:15,780 --> 00:51:17,370
so sixty years twelve hundred dollars a

1490
00:51:17,370 --> 00:51:20,880
year yeah we're talking somewhere in the

1491
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:23,400
range of like seventy something bruce hornsby

1492
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:25,890
and the range yeah so choice just

1493
00:51:25,890 --> 00:51:27,330
