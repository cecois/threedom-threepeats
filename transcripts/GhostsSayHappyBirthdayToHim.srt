00:18:23,235 --> 00:18:27,015
disgusting thing that was a very atypical

496
00:18:27,015 --> 00:18:28,965
sketch yeah because it was very quiet

497
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:29,715
yeah but

498
00:18:29,745 --> 00:18:30,675

how many bugs have i swallowed in

500
00:18:33,015 --> 00:18:34,515
my eye for something like that yeah

501
00:18:34,695 --> 00:18:36,045
he's like what's the grossest thing ever

502
00:18:36,045 --> 00:18:37,335

hard with each other let's ease into

1180
00:42:33,355 --> 00:42:35,305
this what do you say i agree

1181
00:42:35,335 --> 00:42:36,775
what happened last time here i don't

1182
00:42:36,775 --> 00:42:38,436
know dramatize know that's saying we we

1183
00:42:38,444 --> 00:42:39,985
were really challenging to each other and

1184
00:42:39,985 --> 00:42:41,485
it devolved into a lot of tears

1185
00:42:41,935 --> 00:42:43,315
to the lord of the flies type

1186
00:42:43,315 --> 00:42:45,085
of situation yeah yeah it's both were

1187
00:42:45,085 --> 00:42:47,245
crying we murdered someone calling me piggy

1188
00:42:49,345 --> 00:42:50,995
okay it happens in that right yeah

1189
00:42:51,012 --> 00:42:52,615
yeah yeah someone gets called piggy yeah

1190
00:42:52,705 --> 00:42:55,315
yeah yeah for sure to anyone it's

1191
00:42:55,315 --> 00:42:56,365
like a big part of it it's

1192
00:42:56,365 --> 00:42:58,045
like kind of the whole he's the

1193
00:42:58,045 --> 00:42:59,185
voice of reason they murder him

1194
00:43:00,235 --> 00:43:02,995
no yeah he has glasses yeah those

1195
00:43:02,995 --> 00:43:04,787
glasses may break his glasses he's fattening

1196
00:43:04,787 --> 00:43:06,655
his glasses yes and then they murder

1197
00:43:06,655 --> 00:43:07,885
him yes

1198
00:43:09,355 --> 00:43:11,005
so that's a bad sense of events

1199
00:43:12,205 --> 00:43:14,635
i agree let's be cut off his

1200
00:43:14,635 --> 00:43:16,195
head what did we talk about this

1201
00:43:16,195 --> 00:43:17,275
on this show that i don't know

1202
00:43:17,305 --> 00:43:19,735
gene siskel had a problem with one

1203
00:43:19,735 --> 00:43:21,205
of his problems with the movie the

1204
00:43:21,205 --> 00:43:23,935
lord of the flies was that the

1205
00:43:23,965 --> 00:43:25,525
book the lord of the flies didn't

1206
00:43:25,525 --> 00:43:29,605
exist in the movie was so everything

1207
00:43:29,605 --> 00:43:31,645
has said that so that it's like

1208
00:43:32,065 --> 00:43:32,275
i

1209
00:43:32,365 --> 00:43:33,895
i think the plaza exist in the

1210
00:43:33,895 --> 00:43:36,415
book maybe it was a yeah i

1211
00:43:36,415 --> 00:43:38,335
get the kids are guys like lord

1212
00:43:38,335 --> 00:43:38,965
of the flies

1213
00:43:40,915 --> 00:43:42,895
because maybe it was a virtuous modern

1214
00:43:42,895 --> 00:43:44,515
version might have been a modern version

1215
00:43:44,515 --> 00:43:46,645
and he for some reason was like

1216
00:43:47,275 --> 00:43:49,525
you how can you not acknowledge the

1217
00:43:49,525 --> 00:43:51,775
book lord of the flies i mean

1218
00:43:51,775 --> 00:43:53,065
it's like what does he not get

1219
00:43:53,065 --> 00:43:54,805
about it it's a lot like like

1220
00:43:54,895 --> 00:43:57,715
if you're watching a batman movie and

1221
00:43:57,715 --> 00:43:58,825
you're like why don't they just like

1222
00:43:58,825 --> 00:43:59,995
those movies about batman

1223
00:44:00,205 --> 00:44:01,855
yeah or why you'll it's it's a

1224
00:44:01,855 --> 00:44:03,775
world where like in nineteen eighty nine

1225
00:44:03,775 --> 00:44:05,335
no one was excited about going to

1226
00:44:05,335 --> 00:44:06,955
see batman that's what i think they

1227
00:44:06,955 --> 00:44:08,575
should do in godzilla movies i've said

1228
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:11,215
this online i think that godzilla now

1229
00:44:11,245 --> 00:44:13,645
they should say they should reference godzilla

1230
00:44:13,645 --> 00:44:16,165
movies right yeah hey easy it's vampire

1231
00:44:16,225 --> 00:44:19,165
movies that never mentioned dracula like where

1232
00:44:19,165 --> 00:44:20,332
they're all like whoa whoa

1233
00:44:20,395 --> 00:44:22,435
what is this he's right happily mixing

1234
00:44:22,437 --> 00:44:24,446
this one well yeah when there i

1235
00:44:24,535 --> 00:44:25,915
don't have a problem with that he

1236
00:44:25,915 --> 00:44:27,205
used to bother me then i understood

1237
00:44:27,205 --> 00:44:29,185
why they did it like zombies like

1238
00:44:29,185 --> 00:44:30,535
when there wasn't say the word zombie

1239
00:44:30,595 --> 00:44:32,185
oh i know they say walker well

1240
00:44:32,185 --> 00:44:33,895
yeah and it was like oh because

1241
00:44:33,895 --> 00:44:36,085
they're trying to they're creating their own

1242
00:44:36,085 --> 00:44:38,515
universe where this is the first instance

1243
00:44:38,515 --> 00:44:40,525

to name three things but you also

1270
00:45:40,285 --> 00:45:42,055
have to think of a separate thing

1271
00:45:42,055 --> 00:45:43,405
to give to the other person right

1272
00:45:43,615 --> 00:45:46,255
yeah but we can pause after you
