care a lot yeah um

63
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,650
so i i had to do like

64
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,720
a tech check like a couple of

65
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,430
weeks ago for this where i assume

66
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:47,190
weeks before that's a long long time

67
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:49,020
in between tech at least two weeks

68
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:50,880
so much can happen ahead to down

69
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:51,930
i know it's true and i had

70
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:54,450
to download this background they made for

71
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:56,130
me which had like a yellow sort

72
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:57,540
of background and like the freedom logo

73
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:58,320
and i had to put that

74
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,240
as my background and my tech check

75
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:02,040
was under three minutes i mean i

76
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,270
had it all ready to go very

77
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:05,610
bad now i'm very professional he didn't

78
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:06,793
say it was the fastest tech turkey

79
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,350
ever had

80
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,690
um then she is that is that

81
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:14,160
like sex where it's a bad thing

82
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,080
though yeah he was like i didn't

83
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,660
even come up for him it's like

84
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:19,830
i want this to go on

85
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:23,400
it was a rough they probably do

86
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,140
i mean they're getting paid by the

87
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,310
hour you would assume

88
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:28,380
i don't know

89
00:03:29,523 --> 00:03:30,630
really don't think they get paid by

90
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:31,290
the tech check

91
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:35,580
one because dude is probably checked for

92
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,100
hundreds of people there tech checking because

93
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:41,040
when i logged into this award show

94
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,080
i mean the number of podcasts they

95
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,490

the awards alone obviously there's thousands and

99
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:52,560

100
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,600

101
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,650

113
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:14,700
actually see how much of me is

114
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,110

to pay it just it would be

118
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,410
a waste of time so but let

119
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:24,420

i actually copied it about a hundred

149
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:27,240
times cause i was so confused because

150
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,290
i was admitted i was put into

151
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:30,180
this room where i was not able

152
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:32,130
to see myself but i was watching

153
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,110
a backstage greenroom like tech check of

154
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:35,670
other people so i was really confused

155
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:36,630
at camping like a man the wrong

156
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:38,850
place what's going on and so i

157
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:40,740
watched these people like silently do their

158
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:41,010
types

159
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:43,020
it was a super weird and

160
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,020
eventually i text bryan safi because i

161
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:46,710
was like am i in the right

162
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:47,610
place like are you looking at the

163
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:48,390
same thing i'm looking at he's like

164
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:50,370
yeah okay so then eventually we get

165
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:51,810
when we're watching the award show as

166
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:52,920
it's going onto and i have to

167
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:56,070
say cameron esposito was hosting it and

168
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,330
she did not have an easy job

169
00:05:57,330 --> 00:05:59,700
because she's standing in a black void

170
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:01,530
in a room where there was like

171
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:04,110
twenty people in person wet cafe tables

172
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:04,320
with me

173
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,510
masks on who are laughing but it

174
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:08,280
just it seemed like this not your

175
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,800
ideal audience for no no that's the

176
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,820
only place i'll perform

177
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:16,530
exploited in twenty cafe tables by mouse

178
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:17,730
i love that for you like i

179
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:19,290
almost think it would've been easier for

180
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:21,510
her if she were at home like

181
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:23,069
yeah not standing up in front of

182
00:06:23,069 --> 00:06:24,210
these people and having to like you

183
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:27,390
know standing up at home yeah but

184
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:29,580
anyway give her props for that because

185
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:30,840
that's a really hard job so

186
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:34,740
we're we're in the more houses by

187
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,000
the way every step of the way

188
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,610

breakfast club and then ah conan o'brien

198
00:06:58,232 --> 00:07:00,240
which was represented by matt jukes was

199
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,890
there to write well in chinese culture

was really happy to see everyone was

202
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,520
funny but also everyone was kind of

203
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:09,810
weird like it was it was just

204
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:11,250
like a weird like we're all kind

205
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:12,101
of looking at each other like

206
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,210
what was going on yeah and there

207
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:17,280
was this point where okay so first

208
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,300
of all we had done all these

209
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,550
extensive tech checks and then the tech

210
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:22,200
person is like alright everyone looks good

211
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,340
and i was like well it looks

212
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:24,720
like matt needs to flip his logo

213
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,357
because it's backwards and he'll probably want

214
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,480
to be facing the right way when

215
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,080
he wins

216
00:07:29,285 --> 00:07:30,270
and then we all kind of laughed

217
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:31,170
a little bit about how he's gonna

218
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:32,460
win and whatever and he's like i

219
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:33,423
don't know how i got this position

220
00:07:33,423 --> 00:07:34,530
because even he's going i know i'm

221
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:36,360
gonna win it's like it just was

222
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,860
like conan is a shoe in for

223
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:38,610
this award

224
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:42,360
then we have to watch the show

225
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:45,060
but silently so our are on i

226
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:46,290

227
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:49,470

228
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:50,850

229
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:52,200

230
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,460
the zoom for the unlike a green

231
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:55,950
room and then they were playing the

232
00:07:55,952 --> 00:07:57,930
show in the same green room unlike

233
00:07:57,930 --> 00:07:59,640
another square but you

234
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:01,140
our mix were on so that the

235
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:03,150
second a winner was announced you wouldn't

236
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:05,070
have your mic off basic right right

237
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:06,810
but it kinda gave me this like

238
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,030
funeral feeling of like where you can't

239
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:09,990
laugh like i was like

240
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:12,420
i started getting kind of listening to

241
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:14,550
the story shut the fuck up

242
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:18,390

00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:20,820
to the fucking amby yeah stop at

00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:27,390
telling the behind the scenes of this

247
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:30,900
okay so they announced this next category

249
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,580

00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,410
these podcasts and they they do it

251
00:08:37,410 --> 00:08:39,540
like the oscars like where they said

252
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:40,920
the name and then they play an

253
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:43,260
audio clip from the show but it's

254
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:45,720
completely out of context i should just

255
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,670

charity oh shit i feel like a

267
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:10,946

and it was making me laugh so

276
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,194

281
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,610
great time and then i started coming

by the way i don't think it's

294
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,670
probably a good idea for you to

295
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:04,410
be able to be old enough to

296
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:05,550
rent a car before you can have

297
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:07,110

302
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:16,100

so i have to say that sometimes

316
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:44,810
they would lose the nominees and they

317
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:47,270
would show their faces and well whatever

318
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,580
but a lot of times earlier on

319
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:51,290
they would say here's the nominees for

320
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:53,533

would just be like five thousand zoom

322
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:58,640
podcast logos they wouldn't even send on

323
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:59,030

00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,410
remember when you remember when i was

374
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:37,580
nominated for an emmy and then you're

375
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:39,110
like jane lynch is gonna win so

376
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:41,300
just enjoy it i said fuck you

377
00:12:42,294 --> 00:12:44,390
i felt bad but i also like

378
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:45,530
having gone through it a couple of

379
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,480
times yeah you start to get in

380
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,920
your head like i can when i

381
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:51,530
can win and then yeah you crash

382
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:53,600
right after because you can into yourself

383
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,650
in it and it makes you feel

384
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:55,729
bad and so i just kind of

385
00:12:55,729 --> 00:12:57,590
wanted to say like hey this is

386
00:12:57,590 --> 00:12:59,630
probably what's going to happen the person

387
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:01,760
in my dreams it was true but

388
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:03,770
no oh i'm not actually mad no

389
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:04,910
i mean it was true and it's

390
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:05,660
all accurate i'm

391
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:06,920
just saying you did tell me that

392
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,570
and it was true and now when

393
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:10,190
conan was nominated thought he's gonna win

394
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:11,270
and then he did and i mean

395
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:13,190
it does and makes it more as

396
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:16,280
your expectations thing because like especially if

397
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:18,200
like ah if you don't think you're

398
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,400
gonna win then it may and you

399
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:22,070
do it actually makes winning fun you

400
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:23,600
totally because i did go like well

401
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,400
what if we did win somehow right

402
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:25,850
now and

403
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:26,510
and i'm like what am i going

404
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:27,440
to say and then i only had

405
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,700
two seconds to really think about that

406
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,290
and then it was over so right

407
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,410
now it the the minute your category

408
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:35,900
comes up it flashes in your mind

409
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:37,910
like but wait i have a shot

410
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:39,590
at this yeah and if if it

411
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:41,300
only happens then then you only have

412
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:43,460
like twenty seconds before you don't win

413
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:44,870
it's better for your mental it's not

414
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:45,980
as big of a comedown i

415
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,420
yet at the the the one year

416
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:48,770
i went to the movies where it

417
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:49,640
was like i was like oh we're

418
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:50,420
not going to win we're not going

419
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:52,610
to win and then when it was

420
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:56,030
when that when they were reading like

421
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:57,800
and the winner is when that when

422
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,930
that was being said all of us

423
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:02,118
and i got so charged up like

424
00:14:02,118 --> 00:14:05,300
i was full of electricity like wait

425
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:06,170
what

426
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:08,540
it happens and then it didn't happen

427
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:10,160
and it was right such as a

428
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,550
steep letdown yes so quickly yeah i

429
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:15,590
feel like i never i didn't think

430
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:17,390
about it until this one moment and

431
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:20,240
now i know yeah and i have

432
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,310
a party afterwards and yeah it's like

433
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:24,830
it's crazy it's it's nuts well we're

434
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:25,670
gonna say about matt

435
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:28,940
oh matt gave gourley gave a really

436
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:31,190
nice acceptance speech on on behalf of

437
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:33,710
the conan show and was one of

438
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,840
i think maybe jamie pointed this out

439
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,670
one of the only people we saw

440
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:39,980
if not the only who thanked the

441
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:43,790
listeners whoa i o one o oh

442
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:45,800
i was so shocked watching people think

443
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:46,490
a long list

444
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:49,130
most of like people with their podcasts

445
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:50,600
and not just have like a heartfelt

446
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:52,220
because i'm like yeah this doesn't if

447
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:53,900
we'd won would you have even thanked

448
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:56,270
josh i absolutely would not and i

449
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:59,570
hope that just yeah absolutely

450
00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:02,090
but i'm but i did think like

451
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:03,033
oh

452
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:04,730
only because we're getting the common good

453
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:05,900
cats are we getting a chat from

454
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:08,450
joshua on that note no refunds oh

455
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:10,700
alright like in bed like i'm watching

456
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:10,820
this

457
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:16,550
ah fingers in his ears saying la

458
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:19,580
la la yeah that's only fair he's

459
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:21,915
okay but i did say why it

460
00:15:21,915 --> 00:15:23,270
was thinking like is it because we're

461
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:24,980
comedy podcasts that my instinct would be

462
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:26,750
just to go like well i think

463
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:28,340
ourselves for being funny and like that

464
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:29,720
we really nailed it like whatever you

465
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,910
say i'm stupid because like everyone else

466
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:32,060
was

467
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:33,440
taking it so seriously then i was

468
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,360
like i guess they do like journalism

469
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,040
with their podcasts and stuff and so

470
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,300
then that's like a whole nother level

471
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:40,610
of what they're doing like we do

472
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:43,070
bullshit around and that is what's fun

473
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:44,000
about it and that's the kind of

474
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,890
podcast i like to listen to but

475
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:47,870
it's like most these categories where people

476
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:50,750
who are like with the stunning portrayal

477
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,220
of the wars in

478
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:55,130
wherever you digitas yeah exactly now they

479
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,290
show you the wars in the indigenous

480
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:01,760
what other what other current event words

481
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,980
are there it always bugs me because

482
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:05,480
they tell it they they coach you

483
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:08,330
when you're nominated for an award to

484
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:10,640
give a speech they say don't thank

485
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:12,200
everyone because you can do that later

486
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:12,410
after

487
00:16:12,446 --> 00:16:13,968
the show like make a speech that

488
00:16:13,968 --> 00:16:15,770
yeah the speeches given impact are the

489
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:17,360
ones where you say something personal or

490
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,220
you think wasn't in particular or something

491
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,680
and no one does it and so

492
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,820
both times that i want to just

493
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:24,140

over instead of sora yeah it's like

552
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:20,630

553
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:22,880
the midpoint between an emmy and an

554
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,350

555
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:27,800

559
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:34,550
know a lot of the words are

560
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:36,650
at your reward you don't i noticed

561
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:38,510

562
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:41,870
yes aesthetically this award goes in the

563
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:44,150
trash wow it was it felt like

564
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:46,970
it was tinfoil wrapped together why didn't

565
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:48,590
you put it in the loo

566
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:51,740
oh that's in the total doorstop what

567
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:53,360
would we had a we had a

568
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,699
comedy bang bang sketch about someone who

569
00:18:55,699 --> 00:18:57,680
used his awards as doorstops but i

570
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:58,850
can't remember what it is it was

571
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:00,680
such a funny idea though but only

572
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:03,050
specific to people who knew that that

573
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:06,860
cliche of actors using supposedly using their

574
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:09,290
awards story his one is doing anything

575
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,330
funny with it i think everyone's got

576
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:13,010
it somewhere nice and that's that yeah

577
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,690
i think some people put it in

578
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:15,920
the in the bathroom or as a

579
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:18,680
doorstop or whatever really yeah i do

580
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:20,420
because getting so gross about it being

581
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:23,330
ah covered here theses what but

582
00:19:24,623 --> 00:19:25,460
the faecal plume

583
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:29,270
the toilet what what bugs me about

584
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:32,780
that is they're not treating it with

585
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:34,880
that irreverence when they win the award

586
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,580
oh they're not saying this is going

587
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:39,950
right in my toilet versus going up

588
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:42,860
my house it's still it's still doing

589
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:44,870
that but it's still giving it reverence

590
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:46,670
by making it a joke in the

591
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:49,010
house yes exactly then everyone sees it

592
00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:50,060
and then it's like a thing and

593
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:51,170
then you talk to me in houses

594
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:53,330
to be funny but they're acting like

595
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:55,280

cover of that song oh right so

they did get the rights for the

670
00:22:33,315 --> 00:22:34,384
other music i think because it was

671
00:22:34,515 --> 00:22:36,420
that my friend had had a like

672
00:22:36,435 --> 00:22:38,685
illegal copy of the wonder years that

673
00:22:38,685 --> 00:22:39,675
i had forever because

674
00:22:39,675 --> 00:22:41,239
cause you they because we want to

675
00:22:41,239 --> 00:22:43,065
hear music well it had all the

676
00:22:43,065 --> 00:22:44,835
music and like when they would never

677
00:22:44,835 --> 00:22:46,905
air to reruns because there was some

678
00:22:46,905 --> 00:22:48,315
issue with that or something i don't

679
00:22:48,315 --> 00:22:50,115
know about you know old contracts they

680
00:22:50,115 --> 00:22:52,154
never expected anyone to ever rewatch these

681
00:22:52,154 --> 00:22:54,405
shows anywhere else so they they wouldn't

682
00:22:54,405 --> 00:22:55,995
put that in anywhere so it's now

683
00:22:55,995 --> 00:22:58,305
like when we did the ferns movie

684
00:22:58,605 --> 00:22:59,805
every single thing we put

685
00:22:59,835 --> 00:23:01,125
in it we had to get tells

686
00:23:01,125 --> 00:23:01,425
movie

687
00:23:02,505 --> 00:23:05,145
what my mouse movie oh that's right

688
00:23:05,145 --> 00:23:07,035
yeah it's the difference between defers yeah

689
00:23:07,065 --> 00:23:08,775
i'll have thompkins we had to get

690
00:23:08,835 --> 00:23:10,965
every single every single piece of art

691
00:23:10,965 --> 00:23:12,615
that was in it every single song

692
00:23:12,615 --> 00:23:14,745
anything it had to be ah the

693
00:23:14,745 --> 00:23:16,935
contract had to be across all mediums

694
00:23:16,935 --> 00:23:19,425
that will ever be invented in perpetuity

695
00:23:19,425 --> 00:23:20,895
through the end of time because they

696
00:23:20,895 --> 00:23:22,425
never want to be situation

697
00:23:22,665 --> 00:23:25,035
just to make shit up yeah why

698
00:23:25,035 --> 00:23:26,385
don't you just like sing on just

699
00:23:27,225 --> 00:23:30,187
about anybody dvd couldn't hurt

700
00:23:31,275 --> 00:23:35,625
oh my god dare you literally dare

701
00:23:35,625 --> 00:23:37,155
yo hey i can say that it's

702
00:23:37,155 --> 00:23:40,515
my movie that's true um that was

703
00:23:40,515 --> 00:23:42,645
a big problem with ah w caribbean

704
00:23:42,645 --> 00:23:45,225
y w care p b um i

705
00:23:45,225 --> 00:23:47,355
think it couldn't be so either syndicator

706
00:23:47,355 --> 00:23:48,705
they couldn't sell a box they couldn't

707
00:23:48,705 --> 00:23:50,265
do a box set of it because

708
00:23:50,265 --> 00:23:51,195
of all the original

709
00:23:51,465 --> 00:23:53,265
music that was in it because it

710
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:54,765
was you know sen radio station they

711
00:23:54,765 --> 00:23:56,625
would use actual songs how could they

712
00:23:56,625 --> 00:23:58,035
get away with that in the moment

713
00:23:58,515 --> 00:24:00,495
maybe they had like a license like

714
00:24:00,645 --> 00:24:02,505
you know hell yeah does snell does

715
00:24:02,505 --> 00:24:04,815
it because they have the news license

716
00:24:04,815 --> 00:24:07,365
i believe ah the like they're part

717
00:24:07,365 --> 00:24:11,171
of what sports licenses are oh like

718
00:24:11,205 --> 00:24:11,535
lot

719
00:24:11,625 --> 00:24:13,433
so so basically you know live events

720
00:24:13,545 --> 00:24:16,762
in sporting events that they televise the

721
00:24:16,762 --> 00:24:19,605
the stadium will play a song and

722
00:24:19,605 --> 00:24:20,865
you can hear it on the on

723
00:24:20,865 --> 00:24:22,395
the event so they oh yes special

724
00:24:22,395 --> 00:24:25,305
like news license that ah an s

725
00:24:25,305 --> 00:24:26,325
and l is part of that so

726
00:24:26,325 --> 00:24:28,695
they're able to use songs that they

727
00:24:28,725 --> 00:24:31,035
can't then repeat on the show that's

728
00:24:31,035 --> 00:24:31,695
why so many

729
00:24:31,755 --> 00:24:33,315
like so many of their sketches are

730
00:24:33,315 --> 00:24:35,365
taken off peacock and stuff right there

731
00:24:35,365 --> 00:24:38,025

other one not counting the taxed oh

847
00:28:57,525 --> 00:29:00,705
yeah that shouldn't be counted as texts

848
00:29:00,705 --> 00:29:01,995
but no they shouldn't be they shouldn't

849
00:29:01,995 --> 00:29:03,315
be but when you when you get

850
00:29:03,315 --> 00:29:04,905
to your phone and there's like sometimes

851
00:29:04,905 --> 00:29:06,735
with our text chain there are over

852
00:29:06,735 --> 00:29:09,105
a hundred yet texts and it says

you have one hundred and

854
00:29:09,915 --> 00:29:12,705
three new messages and fifty eight of

855
00:29:12,705 --> 00:29:14,745
them are thumbs up or i should

856
00:29:14,745 --> 00:29:17,505
be origin do like no gives us

857
00:29:17,535 --> 00:29:19,605
the red the red circle with a

858
00:29:19,605 --> 00:29:21,225
number for the amount of actual messages

859
00:29:21,225 --> 00:29:23,055
and then like a purple circle with

860
00:29:23,085 --> 00:29:25,065
um like a heart in it for

861
00:29:25,065 --> 00:29:26,624
the amount of tax what's in a

862
00:29:26,624 --> 00:29:28,545
circle i guess the number of numbers

863
00:29:28,545 --> 00:29:29,685
or why is it that otherwise they're

864
00:29:29,687 --> 00:29:30,075
circle

865
00:29:30,705 --> 00:29:33,495
why i think should become yellow circle

866
00:29:33,555 --> 00:29:34,842
it should be like the messages and

867
00:29:34,845 --> 00:29:36,525
it says like you have twenty messages

868
00:29:36,525 --> 00:29:38,385
and you have fifteen tax write i

869
00:29:38,385 --> 00:29:39,345
think there should be also be a

870
00:29:39,345 --> 00:29:40,635
yellow circle that will let you know

871
00:29:40,635 --> 00:29:41,985

872
00:29:41,985 --> 00:29:44,205
time yeah they're nice and that should

873
00:29:44,205 --> 00:29:45,255
be about every there should be some

874
00:29:45,255 --> 00:29:47,080
sort of filter where like asks you

of her hotel room was kinda like

986
00:33:55,284 --> 00:33:56,340
everyone's by the pool it's kind of

987
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:58,230
a thing and then she went out

988
00:33:58,230 --> 00:34:00,060
and then everyone just got trashed and

989
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:02,970
have y'all bad thing yeah we went

990
00:34:02,970 --> 00:34:04,485
through a lot of booze like the

991
00:34:04,485 --> 00:34:05,850
the what i put the recycling out

992
00:34:05,861 --> 00:34:08,100
the next day was a symphony of

993
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:09,150
clinics yeah

994
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,340
the people people are always like oh

995
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:12,780
it's gonna take me so long to

996
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:14,190
figure out how to talk to people

997
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:16,290
again or whatever it's like two minutes

998
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:18,870
and no i know that's not my

999
00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:21,750
concern my concern is not social awkwardness

1000
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:22,500
like how am i going to have

1001
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:25,920
a conversation it's more like the getting

1002
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,660
over the fear that being close to

1003
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:29,310
someone is bad like

1004
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:30,660
i feel like that's the part that's

1005
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:32,400
hard for me to for like forget

1006
00:34:32,430 --> 00:34:34,620
like standing next to someone and being

1007
00:34:34,950 --> 00:34:37,110
not being worried at all seems weird

1008
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:38,730
or not being obsessive about like you

1009
00:34:38,730 --> 00:34:40,950

1010
00:34:40,950 --> 00:34:42,180

00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:08,640
like a mentor when you were starting

1109
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:11,010
out in comedy and someone was telling

1110
00:38:11,010 --> 00:38:12,690
about their mentor and i was thinking

1111
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:14,610
let's call he had kept like a

1112
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:16,140
document of um i mean i know

1113
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:17,430
that i was upset

1114
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:19,980
i didn't but i do i do

1115
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:21,960
remember getting a lot of unsolicited advice

1116
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:25,680
is that the same thing that's interesting

1117
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:27,270
i didn't know i didn't have a

1118
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:28,560
person like that i didn't have like

1119
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:31,110
someone that i look to for nothing

1120
00:38:31,170 --> 00:38:32,460
i yeah i don't i don't think

1121
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:34,050
that i did there would be that

1122
00:38:34,050 --> 00:38:36,660
i admired and everything but nobody kind

1123
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:37,710
of took me under their wing in

1124
00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:40,350
that way or yeah not that i

1125
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,300
thought mark did for me he was

1126
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:43,110
very nice and

1127
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:45,750
in he would come to all of

1128
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:48,630
my shows he was some tiny nice

1129
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:50,670
he would sometimes like say hey what

1130
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:52,980
if i introduced it because he knew

1131
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:54,660
that would be meaningful to the audience

1132
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:56,100
you know wow so he would go

1133
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:57,450
up and introduce it he would be

1134
00:38:57,450 --> 00:38:58,530
in some of the show he'd be

1135
00:38:58,530 --> 00:38:59,730
like hey even if you're nice think

1136
00:38:59,730 --> 00:39:01,050
this isn't funny i just wanna let

1137
00:39:01,050 --> 00:39:02,550
you know i'm going to stand up

1138
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:03,360
here and introduce

1139
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,060
maybe you'll it'll make you think maybe

1140
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:08,310
it is funny i would count poppy

1141
00:39:08,310 --> 00:39:09,870
leave his mentors when i worked on

1142
00:39:09,870 --> 00:39:11,587
that show i mean sure you learn

1143
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:13,020
a lot i learned so many but

1144
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:15,900
they were they were very patient to

1145
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:18,390
teachers in terms of comedy in terms

1146
00:39:18,390 --> 00:39:21,480
of like yeah you know like explaining

1147
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:23,100
something rather than just saying this isn't

1148
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:23,520
good enough

1149
00:39:23,550 --> 00:39:24,990
do it again it was like anyone

1150
00:39:24,990 --> 00:39:26,520
has their moments where they'll shoot something

1151
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:29,040
down or or yes a caustic way

1152
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,570
to shoot something down yeah but they

1153
00:39:30,570 --> 00:39:32,700
they were for the most part you'd

1154
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:34,050
come in with an idea and they

1155
00:39:34,050 --> 00:39:36,000
would take it seriously and not schooling

1156
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:37,770
that sucks yeah they would they would

1157
00:39:37,770 --> 00:39:39,870
take an hour sometimes to like go

1158
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,970
yarwood and and route because and that

1159
00:39:41,970 --> 00:39:43,409
was all a reaction to s and

1160
00:39:43,409 --> 00:39:43,639
l

1161
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:45,780
think yeah yeah bottles experience on it

1162
00:39:45,930 --> 00:39:48,150
absolutely yeah yeah i would say him

1163
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:49,770
and i'm trying to think of any

1164
00:39:49,770 --> 00:39:51,780
restaurants that i oh boy

1165
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:53,850
i was also thinking about the show

1166
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:56,730
for y'all um mike and i just

1167
00:39:56,730 --> 00:39:59,370
did naomi paragon and andy beckman podcast

1168
00:39:59,370 --> 00:40:01,140
couples therapy and we and we were

1169
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:02,190
telling one of the stories but when

1170
00:40:02,190 --> 00:40:04,020
we first were in the same room

1171
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:05,310
as each other which i think i've

1172
00:40:05,310 --> 00:40:07,410
told on three-time which is when mike

1173
00:40:07,410 --> 00:40:09,030
broke garry shandling to u c oh

1174
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:11,220
yeah and yes yes and and they

1175
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:12,480
were like why would he go to

1176
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:14,280
you cbn like he was just like

1177
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:16,650
he he was a gary was so

1178
00:40:16,650 --> 00:40:18,240
cool like wanting to like see what

1179
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:20,010
people were doing now and like keeping

1180
00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:21,270
you know keep up to date on

1181
00:40:21,450 --> 00:40:22,590
everything you do that a lot i

1182
00:40:22,590 --> 00:40:23,820
would see a mature and it's so

1183
00:40:23,910 --> 00:40:25,230
that's so cool because i think that's

1184
00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:27,120
like that is really rare like once

1185
00:40:27,210 --> 00:40:28,800
oh for sure i mean i feel

1186
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:31,890
like i've been doing improv for like

1187
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:32,490
i don't know

1188
00:40:33,375 --> 00:40:35,265
years now or something and i don't

1189
00:40:35,265 --> 00:40:36,585
really i know and i don't really

1190
00:40:36,585 --> 00:40:38,685
want to go see something you don't

1191
00:40:38,685 --> 00:40:39,885
i mean like i'm like i'm excited

1192
00:40:39,885 --> 00:40:42,345
to stay home and now that we've

1193
00:40:42,345 --> 00:40:43,515
had a year of staying home i

1194
00:40:43,575 --> 00:40:45,076
might feel a little differently but like

1195
00:40:45,076 --> 00:40:46,965
right i don't you see me now

1196
00:40:47,355 --> 00:40:49,245
yay yeah right right now i would

1197
00:40:49,245 --> 00:40:51,285
leave this and go do something but

1198
00:40:51,285 --> 00:40:52,545
but i feel like that's such a

1199
00:40:52,545 --> 00:40:53,445
cool trait to have

1200
00:40:53,565 --> 00:40:55,965
like someone who people admire that they

1201
00:40:56,175 --> 00:40:58,095
still go to the shows and or

1202
00:40:58,095 --> 00:41:00,075
i could good audience i would say

1203
00:41:00,075 --> 00:41:01,065
i would say one other person the

1204
00:41:01,065 --> 00:41:03,045

1205
00:41:03,045 --> 00:41:04,635

many stories of him showing up to

1239
00:42:04,005 --> 00:42:05,565

about my chicago days um where like

1261
00:42:49,065 --> 00:42:50,445
it was just the most fun to

1262
00:42:50,445 --> 00:42:52,215
just like stumble into the theater and

1263
00:42:52,215 --> 00:42:53,445

high i'm a little bit

1266
00:42:58,635 --> 00:43:00,285

and there's someone to hang out with

1270
00:43:04,035 --> 00:43:05,175
someone to talk to and like i

1271
00:43:05,205 --> 00:43:06,675

1272
00:43:06,675 --> 00:43:08,385
to do any night and that's always

1273
00:43:08,385 --> 00:43:10,665
there it just like it as you

1274
00:43:10,665 --> 00:43:12,435
do longer and longer that becomes less

1275
00:43:12,435 --> 00:43:14,625
of a like thing you do with

1276
00:43:14,625 --> 00:43:16,185

just don't you know well you should

1331
00:45:03,945 --> 00:45:06,345
look better people um what i think

1332
00:45:06,345 --> 00:45:08,415
is that it makes her the show

1333
00:45:08,415 --> 00:45:10,425
all the time it makes yeah but

1334
00:45:10,425 --> 00:45:12,045
not i do the show some of

1335
00:45:12,045 --> 00:45:12,315
the time

1336
00:45:13,935 --> 00:45:16,575
we wouldn't have this problem um alright

1337
00:45:16,605 --> 00:45:17,955
i think that will do when you

1338
00:45:17,985 --> 00:45:19,965
know there's people watching it makes it

1339
00:45:20,205 --> 00:45:21,825
the the difference in the vibe like

1340
00:45:21,825 --> 00:45:23,205
there's a difference in the vibe from

1341
00:45:23,625 --> 00:45:24,795
like if you're just zooming with a

1342
00:45:24,795 --> 00:45:27,495
friend and it feels like after a

1343
00:45:27,495 --> 00:45:29,024
while it doesn't take long for it

1344
00:45:29,024 --> 00:45:31,755
to feel like this isn't this doesn't

1345
00:45:31,755 --> 00:45:33,165
feel that great you know what i

1346
00:45:33,165 --> 00:45:33,615
mean like

1347
00:45:33,615 --> 00:45:35,835
like it feels awkward then like the

1348
00:45:35,835 --> 00:45:37,425
thing that we're doing right now there

1349
00:45:37,455 --> 00:45:39,075
there there's a difference in vibe to

1350
00:45:39,075 --> 00:45:40,755
that where you feel a little more

1351
00:45:40,755 --> 00:45:43,605
charged up knowing that there's people going

1352
00:45:43,605 --> 00:45:46,035
to listen to this eventually yeah and

1353
00:45:46,035 --> 00:45:47,115
then there's the feeling of knowing that

1354
00:45:47,115 --> 00:45:49,545
people are watching live is like it's

1355
00:45:49,635 --> 00:45:51,945
i can't believe how much it feels

1356
00:45:51,945 --> 00:45:53,355
like a show like it really feels

1357
00:45:53,355 --> 00:45:53,655
fine

1358
00:45:53,775 --> 00:45:56,428
does really make you feel different and

1359
00:45:56,513 --> 00:45:57,735
like i feel like i'll be like

1360
00:45:57,945 --> 00:45:59,685
sweaty and like putting in you know

1361
00:45:59,835 --> 00:46:00,615
you have to put in a lot

1362
00:46:00,615 --> 00:46:02,835
of energy from your soul because you're

1363
00:46:02,835 --> 00:46:05,175
projecting something trying to be humorous through

1364
00:46:05,475 --> 00:46:08,445
a computer which is harder yeah um

1365
00:46:08,445 --> 00:46:11,625

things in five seconds player one comes

1478
00:51:09,980 --> 00:51:12,620
up with a question such as name

1479
00:51:12,620 --> 00:51:14,570
three famous jennifer's more of a command

1480
00:51:15,350 --> 00:51:17,210
player two has five seconds to answer

1481
00:51:17,210 --> 00:51:18,710
if they succeed they get a point

1482
00:51:18,710 --> 00:51:20,390
if they fail player three gets a

1483
00:51:20,390 --> 00:51:22,820
chance to answer the same question but

1484
00:51:23,150 --> 00:51:26,240
player three cannot reuse reuse the ones

1485
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:27,710
that were already said they must come

1486
00:51:27,710 --> 00:51:29,510
up with three brand new answers you

1487
00:51:29,510 --> 00:51:31,070
keep alternating between players two and three

1488
00:51:31,070 --> 00:51:33,110
stills till someone wins a point so

1489
00:51:33,110 --> 00:51:34,730

someone wins a point oh until someone

1497
00:51:50,990 --> 00:51:52,400
