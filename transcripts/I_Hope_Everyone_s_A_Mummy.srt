00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,430
do a tour as well but it's

35
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:18,900
a tall order with this bbc tall

36
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,340
order and by the way that's why

37
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:22,830
the tour was so jam packed for

38
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:23,760
the comedy baseball tour

39
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:24,990
are full of fun but it was

40
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:26,593
why we did so many shows and

41
00:01:26,593 --> 00:01:27,960

42
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,940

dragging it all over the bathroom floor

193
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:20,010

194
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:21,450

197
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,431
her play with everything right but she

198
00:06:26,431 --> 00:06:28,080
gets fixated on something is it like

199
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,190
it was sort of like it's kind

200
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:30,333
of i was getting ready so i

201
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:31,354
was kinda like yeah here just take

202
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,090
this it's kind of soft and you're

203
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:34,890
painting everything with it and then like

204
00:06:34,967 --> 00:06:36,810
just getting all sorts of new bacteria

205
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:38,100
because i certainly don't wash it enough

206
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,030
to begin with or you know to

207
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:41,340
play with mixed gun um

208
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:45,900
i mean yeah you know superbowl he

209
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,490
talks about that gun all just be

210
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:48,840
very clear he doesn't have a gun

211
00:06:48,935 --> 00:06:49,980
we do he says i keep it

212
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:51,030
in the drunk drawer and what it's

213
00:06:51,059 --> 00:06:51,720
to look there

214
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:54,718
the drunk don't the judge dog jars

215
00:06:54,718 --> 00:06:56,490
the group i said with god yeah

216
00:06:56,550 --> 00:07:00,270
um like judah rock drunk junk dry

217
00:07:00,272 --> 00:07:02,280
no but i mean i like the

218
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,930
idea though like this is stuff like

219
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:06,300
throw in there when i'm drunk i've

220
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,770
been using it i just throw it

221
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:09,300
in and i look at the end

222
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,770
of the year are you surprised by

223
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:12,060
how many people you know that do

224
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:12,570
have a gun

225
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:15,600
ah you know what i don't at

226
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,490
this point i don't know how many

227
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:19,440
people that is i don't know exactly

228
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,240
because i know definitely there's a few

229
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,550
people that i i definitely know i'm

230
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:25,290
trying remember the last most surprised where

231
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:27,000
somebody told me i was like really

232
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,950
yeah yeah i think people should be

233
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:30,840
allowed one and they should not be

234
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:33,120
assault weapons so yeah obviously

235
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:35,400
look we can all agree guns they're

236
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:38,280
great and what a great invention and

237
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,590
certainly we need them i mean we

238
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:43,530
all agree that go pew pew could

239
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:45,000
not agree more

240
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:48,570
i actually disagree you say that they

241
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:49,500
don't know you

242
00:07:51,894 --> 00:07:57,990
yeah good job were you happy when

243
00:07:57,990 --> 00:07:59,400
you are able to imitate a gun

244
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:01,368
of course i was yeah how did

245
00:08:01,368 --> 00:08:03,630
you see that elated i do that

246
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:08,190
it's really you're like yeah you're you're

247
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:10,890
clenching your deals together and then forcing

248
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:12,360
air out of your larynx but then

249
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:14,910
something's going on with your tongue bill

250
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:16,770
nye or yeah he's literally the science

251
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:19,620
guy i'm like um i remember once

252
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:21,540
in an interview with gds rasulo really

253
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:23,190
the science guy jimmy gruffalo they asked

254
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:24,960
her like some dumb question

255
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,700
and like what's the what's the biggest

256
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:29,790
difference between you know male comedy and

257
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:32,610
female comedy or something and she said

258
00:08:33,510 --> 00:08:34,650
i don't really know that there's that

259
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:36,690
much of a difference i guess men

260
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:40,140
are better at making gun sounds interesting

261
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:42,720
what's true is it true that's honestly

262
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,400
my big takeaway from comedy bang bang

263
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:44,966
women are

264
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,200
as funny as men but men make

265
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,870
better gun sounds yeah interesting sometimes just

266
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:52,320
a simple absolutely wow was just a

267
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,430
simple um what

268
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:57,360
zubin yeah i already ran over to

269
00:08:57,450 --> 00:09:00,120
go where else close close knit with

270
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,970
janie here's well where i used to

271
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:05,640
go home for thanksgiving as well and

272
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:08,190
then stopped that after a while because

273
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:09,720
i was also going on for christmas

274
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,820
traveling at that time that's oh we've

275
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,530
talked about ah thanksgivings too close to

276
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:14,640
christmas way some hey

277
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,170
a i forget which episode it is

278
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:18,000
we reorder the holidays it was i

279
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,700
think really great actually what i yeah

280
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:21,900
i'm thinking about this some kind of

281
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:22,980
a fresh way i don't think this

282
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:23,848
is how i thought about this the

283
00:09:23,848 --> 00:09:27,000
same thing we have at this time

284
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,490
halloween is at the end of october

285
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:33,420
november has thanksgiving three weeks until then

286
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:34,800
you have christmas actually

287
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:37,020
my thinking is we need one at

288
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:39,240
the end of every month that's good

289
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,130
and different where you want you want

290
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:43,500
a good one like halloween thanksgiving christmas

291
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,690
every month yeah here's what i'm thinking

292
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,040
i really would like that the other

293
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:51,780
day because halloween thanksgiving and halloween and

294
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:53,760
christmas the two main ones where you

295
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,960
celebrate it all month long

296
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,310
i'm like you start at the beginning

297
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:57,690
of the month you put out decorations

298
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:00,841
yeah yeah yeah thanksgiving giving you bought

299
00:10:00,842 --> 00:10:03,030
some knowing okay whatever oh leave some

300
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:05,640
leaves from your where's your whore know

301
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:09,448
plenty but like st patrick's day it's

302
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:10,950
well middle of the month the one

303
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:12,360
thing i would say is virus july

304
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,760
fourth you get flags american flags for

305
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:15,120
quieted

306
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,670
a month before yeah maybe a month

307
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:19,170
before but then there yeah but it's

308
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:21,630
like i don't listen i think that

309
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:22,740
one should count as a good one

310
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:24,450
because it's got you got fireworks if

311
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:25,800
you do it right you like it

312
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,510
because your birthdays buy it yeah but

313
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:29,850
actually i would say i always loved

314
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:32,071
fourth of july fireworks but let's put

315
00:10:32,071 --> 00:10:32,820
it at the end of the month

316
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:34,890
though in your plan because then you

317
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:35,910
have to look forward

318
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:38,280
two yeah july thirty first independence day

319
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,810
is as the end of the month

320
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,580
so those are the four good ones

321
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:43,950
i think okay but what what would

322
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:45,450
be a good holiday like what do

323
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:47,700
you like about these holidays like it's

324
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,080
going to be different because halloween you

325
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,060
can't just replicate halloween of like halloween

326
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:53,880
to season of the witch it's gotta

327
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,588
be like you can't just read you

328
00:10:55,588 --> 00:10:56,070

to in common

618
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,490
very good very good they'd be a

619
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:16,960
good like laffey taffy joke

620
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:19,780
good what happens when two mummies a

621
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:21,760
good one or typical one are we

622
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:23,590
what do you call it when two

623
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:25,180
mummies fart at the same time two

624
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:26,920
in common suit in common how you

625
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:29,140
spell it though you have to spend

626
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:30,790
you'd have to spell like tooting common

627
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:32,560
and and then sees i think it

628
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:34,270
only works common if they only worked

629
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:35,230

630
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:36,910
lot once you read it lauren

that's how it gets you gotta read

632
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:42,040
right that's how the oral tradition continues

633
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,480

it into the pattern when you make

sounds like great time really sure how

802
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:07,960
long is the flight i don't remember

803
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:10,060
too much yeah i think it's if

804
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:12,760
it was two hours two hours it's

805
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,740
probably ten but you stand the whole

806
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:17,500
time right um you have to stand

807
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:19,000
and you have to have your eyes

808
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,420
wide open there's no shutting blinking and

809
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:23,890
ah that's it wow

810
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:25,900
do they feel like spraying thing in

811
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:28,120
your eyeballs to keep them wet sausages

812
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,853
oh i guess i can't just dangle

813
00:28:30,853 --> 00:28:33,250
them my dad by the way who's

814
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:35,260
in the aerospace industry oh yeah it

815
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:37,780
was oh we're talking about like what's

816
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:40,000
next for for you know airplane travel

817
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,620
or whatever like how do you get

818
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:44,050
five oh wait is it called aerospace

819
00:28:44,050 --> 00:28:45,846
as if it's just arrow and this

820
00:28:45,846 --> 00:28:47,620
is called aerosmith because they couldn't get

821
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:49,540
the rights to aero space i think

822
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:50,950
so too both of you

823
00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:53,770
i think that's a cheat if you

824
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,660
if you're just a helicopter dude you're

825
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:57,400
not in space i read that the

826
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,770
show arrow was it was meant to

827
00:28:59,770 --> 00:29:01,450
be a e r o like the

828
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:03,700
candy bar and they misspelled it in

829
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,200
there like holy shit now we have

830
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,520
to justify this guy's got to shoot

831
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:09,130
arrows do you know what i have

832
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:12,130
a friend who in shop

833
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:14,410
class or whatever it was you know

834
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:18,850
million years ago this dum dum the

835
00:29:20,084 --> 00:29:23,320
use bow arrow and she's a r

836
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:24,910
r o w he's like well right

837
00:29:25,090 --> 00:29:27,159
and he made himself a belt that

838
00:29:27,159 --> 00:29:32,440
said aerosmith ah i agree like the

839
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:36,370
kurt bucy comic absolutely incorrect that's how

840
00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:38,170
it's spelled oh i wrote something called

841
00:29:38,170 --> 00:29:39,670
aerosmith that's it was the guy who

842
00:29:39,670 --> 00:29:40,210
made arrows

843
00:29:40,210 --> 00:29:42,460
bs i don't i don't know what

844
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:43,900
the actual plot of it was but

845
00:29:44,188 --> 00:29:46,360
this like get very bright right in

846
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,800
my eyes or i just move into

847
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,030
it's path i think he moved into

848
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:51,070
his pow worried about you um but

849
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:52,690
we worried about you too okay so

850
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:53,650
my dad and i were talking about

851
00:29:53,650 --> 00:29:56,350
what's next for for flights and how

852
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:57,640
do they get faster and he was

853
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:00,370
saying this is his theory that

854
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:03,820
they that's basically it won't be planes

855
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:07,075
necessarily but they will shoot and you'll

856
00:30:07,075 --> 00:30:10,090
you get onto a rocket no one

857
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:13,030
will want it will shoot up into

858
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:15,640
the air and come down at any

859
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,530
place and come down because the the

860
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:19,960
earth will have rotated it'll take like

861
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:20,530
an hour

862
00:30:20,530 --> 00:30:22,270
our to get to germany or whatever

863
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:24,340
i love that idea now you're in

864
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:26,030
just because it takes less time oh

865
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:27,070
wait you just go straight up in

866
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:28,150
the air go straight up in the

867
00:30:28,150 --> 00:30:29,786
air hanging out there for hour you

868
00:30:29,793 --> 00:30:32,086
just know you don't hang out huh

869
00:30:32,086 --> 00:30:34,150
yeah i've explosions and deaths

870
00:30:35,905 --> 00:30:38,847
the scientist smiling you're so excited about

871
00:30:38,847 --> 00:30:40,525
it like the joe ward is rubbing

872
00:30:40,525 --> 00:30:41,575
your hands together

873
00:30:44,157 --> 00:30:46,645
dollar signs and loud ticks are losing

874
00:30:46,645 --> 00:30:48,595
your signing a petition to elect you

875
00:30:48,595 --> 00:30:50,245
for congress so you can happen back

876
00:30:50,245 --> 00:30:52,045
notice if the law is going to

877
00:30:52,045 --> 00:30:55,165
be opposition leader tenable to ever talk

878
00:30:55,165 --> 00:30:57,655
to your dad about chem trails trails

879
00:30:57,655 --> 00:30:58,975

mummies

883
00:31:10,345 --> 00:31:11,575
because we got to finally talk about

884
00:31:11,575 --> 00:31:13,795
kanye well first let's talk about chem

885
00:31:13,825 --> 00:31:15,025
trails i think it would dovetail nicely

886
00:31:15,235 --> 00:31:17,005
okay what what it tells me about

887
00:31:17,005 --> 00:31:17,995
kim charles do you know about kim

888
00:31:17,995 --> 00:31:20,275
trans i do i know that people

889
00:31:20,305 --> 00:31:22,555
believe in them that it's sort of

890
00:31:22,555 --> 00:31:25,255
one of those conspiracy theory yes and

891
00:31:25,255 --> 00:31:26,515
you know like those white lines in

892
00:31:26,515 --> 00:31:29,155
the sky white lines run

893
00:31:29,215 --> 00:31:31,435
through my mind yeah yeah people say

894
00:31:31,435 --> 00:31:34,345
that that's what no camara his contract

895
00:31:34,405 --> 00:31:36,475
ah you know a lot of guys

896
00:31:37,315 --> 00:31:39,595
all i know is i think it's

897
00:31:39,595 --> 00:31:41,095
a conspiracy theory right because there's a

898
00:31:41,095 --> 00:31:43,735
conspiracy theory and the the theory as

899
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:46,645
i understand it is that ah it's

900
00:31:46,645 --> 00:31:48,925
how all of the world's governments keep

901
00:31:48,925 --> 00:31:51,355
us docile oh like those little dust

902
00:31:51,355 --> 00:31:52,075
in the air it's kind of like

903
00:31:52,075 --> 00:31:54,205
causing me to like yeah breathe into

904
00:31:54,205 --> 00:31:55,135
the rag a little bit

905
00:31:56,425 --> 00:31:58,285

906
00:31:58,315 --> 00:32:00,505
recommend rag like you guys did into

907
00:32:00,507 --> 00:32:03,205

909
00:32:05,067 --> 00:32:07,555
that body that that government rag the

910
00:32:07,555 --> 00:32:09,985
idea that the government was like how

911
00:32:09,985 --> 00:32:11,125
do we keep people from rising up

912
00:32:11,125 --> 00:32:13,975
against us why don't we just have

913
00:32:13,975 --> 00:32:16,435
planes just sort of crop dust yeah

914
00:32:16,465 --> 00:32:19,195

just people some people just have very

919
00:32:27,205 --> 00:32:28,975
interesting belief system well it's enjoyed that

920
00:32:29,425 --> 00:32:31,285
because it is a neutral as possible

921
00:32:31,315 --> 00:32:33,415
if you look at semi recent events

922
00:32:33,955 --> 00:32:35,305
it only took a few hundred people

923
00:32:35,305 --> 00:32:37,165
almost overthrow the government so it's like

924
00:32:37,195 --> 00:32:38,785
there's millions of millions here we could

925
00:32:38,785 --> 00:32:40,465
do whatever we wanted and yet we

926
00:32:40,465 --> 00:32:43,525
don't because of fucking chem trails good

927
00:32:44,125 --> 00:32:45,445
but starting to come around on this

928
00:32:45,655 --> 00:32:45,955
way

929
00:32:45,955 --> 00:32:47,830
way to keep them ways of course

930
00:32:47,889 --> 00:32:51,505
spray vinegar okay so oh yes kind

931
00:32:51,505 --> 00:32:52,945
of like how you smell like vinegar

932
00:32:52,945 --> 00:32:54,505
all the time um i'm sure i

933
00:32:54,505 --> 00:32:56,065
don't know what you mean so if

934
00:32:56,065 --> 00:32:58,165
you spray vinegar it'll eventually waft up

935
00:32:58,165 --> 00:32:59,635
to the sky just know it does

936
00:32:59,635 --> 00:33:02,395
well dissipates in your immediate area oh

937
00:33:02,395 --> 00:33:03,835
so it's actually the white lines aren't

938
00:33:03,835 --> 00:33:04,975
really as far away as it is

939
00:33:04,975 --> 00:33:06,115
it's down in my mind

940
00:33:06,115 --> 00:33:07,735
and the white lines are up there

941
00:33:07,765 --> 00:33:09,625
but then all the shit comes down

942
00:33:09,625 --> 00:33:11,905

00:39:03,025 --> 00:39:05,215
and i have to go so i

1108
00:39:05,275 --> 00:39:07,165
must have been crazy for you so

1109
00:39:07,165 --> 00:39:08,635
i picture you like like you know

1110
00:39:08,635 --> 00:39:09,925
window eating red lobster

1111
00:39:11,215 --> 00:39:15,505
breaking into a lab billboard so basically

1112
00:39:16,045 --> 00:39:19,015
i am now in the situation that

1113
00:39:19,045 --> 00:39:20,785
like you see in the old classic

1114
00:39:20,785 --> 00:39:22,765
movies when there's a pregnancy where right

1115
00:39:22,765 --> 00:39:24,085
because the men was we're always waiting

1116
00:39:24,085 --> 00:39:25,495
men were always in the waiting room

1117
00:39:25,495 --> 00:39:27,055
so i'm basically like hanging out in

1118
00:39:27,055 --> 00:39:29,905
the hospital all afternoon fun on my

1119
00:39:29,905 --> 00:39:31,015
phone and then my

1120
00:39:31,315 --> 00:39:33,595
one phone is about to die fine

1121
00:39:33,595 --> 00:39:35,155
so i go out into the car

1122
00:39:35,155 --> 00:39:37,675
and just like shill in the car

1123
00:39:37,675 --> 00:39:39,415
all day and all night it sounds

1124
00:39:39,415 --> 00:39:40,615
like heaven how long did it go

1125
00:39:40,615 --> 00:39:42,715
on um so

1126
00:39:44,305 --> 00:39:46,255
by the way i have we we

1127
00:39:46,255 --> 00:39:48,415
supposedly the the process is when the

1128
00:39:48,415 --> 00:39:49,825
baby is delivered we then get ah

1129
00:39:49,885 --> 00:39:51,595
our own room like the babies taken

1130
00:39:51,595 --> 00:39:53,035
to a room and that you know

1131
00:39:53,275 --> 00:39:55,105
that's when they get the stork yeah

1132
00:39:55,135 --> 00:39:57,595
train stork they hang it on the

1133
00:39:57,625 --> 00:39:59,365
beak and then it walks into your

1134
00:39:59,365 --> 00:40:00,865
oxen yeah exactly yeah that would be

1135
00:40:00,865 --> 00:40:02,455
really cool when the noise he makes

1136
00:40:02,455 --> 00:40:02,995
is like

1137
00:40:06,265 --> 00:40:07,705
i learned they do it i guess

1138
00:40:08,035 --> 00:40:08,995
she was gonna go for it without

1139
00:40:08,995 --> 00:40:10,555
thinking and then that's when i don't

1140
00:40:10,555 --> 00:40:11,725
think i know it it's all about

1141
00:40:11,725 --> 00:40:14,815
that comes so ah so i'm just

1142
00:40:14,815 --> 00:40:16,015
in the situation where i'm like you

1143
00:40:16,015 --> 00:40:19,015
know doing the difficult pacing the the

1144
00:40:19,045 --> 00:40:20,605

1253
00:43:56,365 --> 00:43:58,375
believe it like what was your emotional

1254
00:43:58,585 --> 00:44:00,715
ah because the night before

1255
00:44:00,715 --> 00:44:02,065
for you know it was one of

1256
00:44:02,065 --> 00:44:03,655
those like every two hours week yeah

1257
00:44:03,685 --> 00:44:06,355
it was just like sheer just exhaustion

1258
00:44:06,355 --> 00:44:07,705

1259
00:44:07,705 --> 00:44:09,355
home from riverside which that it was

1260
00:44:09,415 --> 00:44:10,585

1261
00:44:10,585 --> 00:44:11,695
in the car cool i fell asleep

1262
00:44:11,725 --> 00:44:12,950

absolutely you would just walk everywhere that

1445
00:50:30,055 --> 00:50:31,735
broader connects something to the other thing

1446
00:50:33,175 --> 00:50:33,715

1447
00:50:36,415 --> 00:50:39,655

1462
00:51:09,785 --> 00:51:11,975
and i said yesterday showing it because

1463
00:51:11,975 --> 00:51:13,175
it doesn't affect you at all it's

1464
00:51:13,175 --> 00:51:14,555
not a waste of money if you

1465
00:51:14,675 --> 00:51:16,325
like it and use it and you

1466
00:51:16,325 --> 00:51:17,765
can afford it i think it's a

1467
00:51:17,765 --> 00:51:19,475
waste of money if you're saying like

1468
00:51:19,715 --> 00:51:21,245
again avoid this but i'm gonna do

1469
00:51:21,245 --> 00:51:22,505
it and i'm not going to use

1470
00:51:22,505 --> 00:51:22,715
it

1471
00:51:23,375 --> 00:51:24,335
that's a waste of money

1472
00:51:25,415 --> 00:51:27,395
um i dated in high school i

1473
00:51:27,395 --> 00:51:29,765
dated somebody who i did post it

1474
00:51:29,765 --> 00:51:31,835
seems always talking about girls never mentioned

1475
00:51:31,835 --> 00:51:33,755
these always signs that girl but she

1476
00:51:33,785 --> 00:51:35,765
her family had this boat and it

1477
00:51:35,765 --> 00:51:37,385
was like the best boat situation i

1478
00:51:37,385 --> 00:51:39,185
think because it was in huntington harbour

1479
00:51:39,215 --> 00:51:40,025
they got into best book

1480
00:51:41,675 --> 00:51:43,745
um but where basically it's just like

1481
00:51:43,745 --> 00:51:45,485
you can travel around this very serene

1482
00:51:45,485 --> 00:51:47,885
water that's by everyone's houses and just

1483
00:51:47,885 --> 00:51:49,445
these like that's almost so good and

1484
00:51:49,445 --> 00:51:50,645
stuff like that it was like ok

1485
00:51:50,645 --> 00:51:53,285
i like this but then what for

1486
00:51:53,285 --> 00:51:55,685
someone's birthday once someone in co-op's friend

1487
00:51:55,685 --> 00:51:57,245
group rented a boat for like oh

1488
00:51:57,245 --> 00:51:58,655
let's go out on the water for

1489
00:51:58,655 --> 00:52:00,905
thing everyone sees it immediately

1490
00:52:01,385 --> 00:52:03,035
or just not worth that no no

1491
00:52:03,035 --> 00:52:04,745
no no i'm really iraqi people onto

1492
00:52:04,745 --> 00:52:06,245
a boat believe i've talked about it

1493
00:52:06,245 --> 00:52:08,225
on our show before but jamie and

1494
00:52:08,225 --> 00:52:09,905
i rented a boat in south carolina

1495
00:52:10,265 --> 00:52:11,315
a couple of years ago and it

1496
00:52:11,315 --> 00:52:13,355
was so much like we would want

1497
00:52:13,355 --> 00:52:14,825
to know because you what is it

1498
00:52:14,837 --> 00:52:17,525
common placid though and like ah yeah

1499
00:52:17,525 --> 00:52:18,695
i mean you're going out and like

1500
00:52:18,695 --> 00:52:20,165
the it's not like a lake so

1501
00:52:20,165 --> 00:52:21,545
there is it's the river

1502
00:52:21,545 --> 00:52:24,125
or it's the intercoastal waterway okay and

1503
00:52:24,125 --> 00:52:26,105
there's certain places like you cannot go

1504
00:52:26,105 --> 00:52:27,395
over there and you can't go over

1505
00:52:27,395 --> 00:52:28,175
there and you have to be really

1506
00:52:28,175 --> 00:52:31,655
mindful of how um how deep you

1507
00:52:31,655 --> 00:52:33,395
are because if you go too shallow

1508
00:52:33,395 --> 00:52:35,015
you run into ground that's a big

1509
00:52:35,015 --> 00:52:36,875
fuckin deal and so there's all kinds

1510
00:52:36,875 --> 00:52:38,795
of monitors and things like that like

1511
00:52:38,795 --> 00:52:41,645
little nightmares but things that monitor your

1512
00:52:41,705 --> 00:52:44,465
not seeing it's not like video monitors

1513
00:52:45,065 --> 00:52:46,865
but there's you know there there's all

1514
00:52:46,865 --> 00:52:48,425
kinds of gauges and shit like that

1515
00:52:48,485 --> 00:52:49,295
you have to be aware of and

1516
00:52:49,295 --> 00:52:50,795
i i like that part of it

1517
00:52:50,795 --> 00:52:52,505
too but you you pick it up

1518
00:52:52,505 --> 00:52:55,085
very quickly yeah you know and you

1519
00:52:55,115 --> 00:52:56,255
when once you get the hang of

1520
00:52:56,255 --> 00:52:58,235
it it's really really fun it's great

1521
00:52:58,325 --> 00:52:59,045
i can't wait to do it again

1522
00:52:59,075 --> 00:53:00,305
and they shouldn't be letting people do

1523
00:53:00,305 --> 00:53:01,445
it why don't you go jump in

1524
00:53:01,445 --> 00:53:01,745
a lake

1525
00:53:02,825 --> 00:53:05,255
you know what maybe i will relax

1526
00:53:05,255 --> 00:53:06,575
you're at the lake how is that

1527
00:53:06,575 --> 00:53:08,225
an insult by the way go jump

1528
00:53:08,225 --> 00:53:09,515
in a lake oh yeah jump it's

1529
00:53:09,515 --> 00:53:11,225
like hey sounds fun but you're saying

1530
00:53:11,225 --> 00:53:13,265
it's someone fully clothed that's the implication

1531
00:53:13,355 --> 00:53:14,817
it's yeah but like you said like

1532
00:53:14,817 --> 00:53:16,505
