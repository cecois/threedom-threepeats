how

236
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:43,380
what happened was that started hello when

237
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:44,670
i heard the verbal thing is a

238
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:46,770
sexual fetish game and then someone said

239
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,630
gerbil looks a lot like the word

240
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:50,760
gear put it in there and then

241
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:53,460
it was telephone this theory is where

242
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:56,130

309
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:32,510
this crime

310
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:33,830
when they not say it sometime because

311
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:35,120
they would show it because that is

312
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,720
an offensive term yeah and say we're

313
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,430
way ahead but most just sucked when

314
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:42,560
everyone started calling testicles nuts back in

315
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,480
the seventy i was shocked when people

316
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,310
call testicles in ways they waited as

317
00:11:46,310 --> 00:11:48,560
long as they could seventy six rounds

318
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,030
like let's just do it oh wait

319
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:51,320
they call them that because they're like

320
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,520
walnuts i think so

321
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,500
but there hasn't i think so there

322
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,540
hasn't been a new term for testicles

323
00:11:56,570 --> 00:11:58,310
in a long time voice like guys

324
00:11:58,490 --> 00:11:59,720
i feel like we ran out of

325
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,400
stuff in the eighties or whatever like

326
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,720

00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:14,600
already been done right that's fair mortals

332
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:16,550

doing something like that oh why is

688
00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:31,560

697
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,430
producer that yeah this up yeah exactly

698
00:25:47,730 --> 00:25:50,100
um so i it was so awkward

699
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:51,780

and this kid gets um he gets

930
00:32:47,775 --> 00:32:49,905
a blank check because he gets hit

931
00:32:49,905 --> 00:32:51,405
by a guy who got awake and

932
00:32:51,405 --> 00:32:53,175
then the guy gives a big check

933
00:32:53,175 --> 00:32:54,705
just in time to stop he doesn't

00:32:54,705 --> 00:32:54,885
realize

935
00:32:56,385 --> 00:32:57,525

in every conceivable terms of how wrong

1231
00:43:22,670 --> 00:43:23,900

1232
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:25,790
person i worked with my good girl

1233
00:43:25,790 --> 00:43:26,480

1238
00:43:36,937 --> 00:43:38,630
good game if you fucking play it

1239
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:40,550
ask more than you should get worried

1240
00:43:40,550 --> 00:43:42,410
alcohol what kind of alcohol would you

1241
00:43:42,410 --> 00:43:45,830
be i would be um i'd be

1242
00:43:45,830 --> 00:43:48,440
a late night glasses schnapps

1243
00:43:51,470 --> 00:43:54,080
this is obviously a drinker glory i

1244
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:56,510
mean she knows her alcohol i don't

1245
00:43:56,510 --> 00:43:57,320
even know what that is but i

1246
00:43:57,320 --> 00:44:01,070
think it's ah um if you are

1247
00:44:01,070 --> 00:44:02,300
a sport what sport would you be

1248
00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:05,060
um i don't care about sports i

1249
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:06,890
wouldn't be a sport i might be

1250
00:44:06,890 --> 00:44:08,600
i might be lovely

1251
00:44:08,870 --> 00:44:10,670
so is the idea that the person

1252
00:44:10,670 --> 00:44:12,410
the celebrity is choosing to be these

1253
00:44:12,410 --> 00:44:14,390
things yeah okay alright so that's what

1254
00:44:14,390 --> 00:44:15,590
i think wow i mean that's how

1255
00:44:15,590 --> 00:44:16,910
i okay okay it just wants to

1256
00:44:16,910 --> 00:44:17,810
give you the idea of who that

1257
00:44:17,810 --> 00:44:20,539
is ok cool for supremacy with the

1258
00:44:20,539 --> 00:44:21,980
rules okay go ahead

1259
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:27,410
alright like for example we did around

1260
00:44:27,770 --> 00:44:29,270

i get that but but the sports

1267
00:44:38,990 --> 00:44:40,730
thing you could have divided the energy

1268
00:44:40,730 --> 00:44:42,560
of the person sports chose not to

1269
00:44:44,180 --> 00:44:48,260
sport is competitive ah ah they're all

1270
00:44:48,260 --> 00:44:51,440
