working together on mister show and whatnot

225
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:31,800
and was there ever a time where

226
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,120
you traveled together and you shared a

227
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,910

00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:37,590
overlap on miss yeah we did different

229
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:40,080
oh i know that's ever been said

230
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,300
different seasons just like the richard bachman

231
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,310
we have we ever wanted people to

232
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:47,070
guess it nobody guessed it and i

233
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:48,480
guess i just built the bean snail

234
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,210
scout sorry yeah yeah finally well yeah

235
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:53,010
we have that big contest going on

236
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:56,250
where people would be flown out ah

237
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,590
business class with yeah a friend and

238
00:08:58,590 --> 00:09:00,240
they'd be fazed we would scream

239
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,890
even with floating yeah yeah like just

240
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:05,310
all the play oh day oh hey

241
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,430
and no one's one so and you've

242
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:11,520
given it away but that's okay alright

243
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:13,890
all the flow days has expired i

244
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:15,000
think the only time i had to

245
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,090
share was for some reason like the

246
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,950
third year of south by southwest

247
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:22,470
ah map ranga couldn't find a hotel

248
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:23,430
room and i was like not just

249
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:25,350
stay with me it's the only time

250
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:27,690
he shared i heard eight billion times

251
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,850
um i think women do that more

252
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:31,948
than men do ah is that because

253
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:33,600
they like to rub up navy maybe

254
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,100

pick them out at the pet store

420
00:15:18,685 --> 00:15:20,545
and think that's cute and it's like

421
00:15:20,545 --> 00:15:21,685
a pretty easy pet the only problem

422
00:15:21,685 --> 00:15:23,305
is cleaning the tank which i didn't

423
00:15:23,515 --> 00:15:25,375
i don't pay ever did as just

424
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:27,205
gonna get dirty and dirty yeah fish

425
00:15:27,205 --> 00:15:28,195
dies and then you flush

426
00:15:28,285 --> 00:15:29,515
down the toilet i know my friend

427
00:15:29,515 --> 00:15:31,555
has a um carnival fish that's been

428
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:33,115
going on six years now

429
00:15:33,775 --> 00:15:37,105
ooh i had my carnival fish why

430
00:15:37,105 --> 00:15:39,295
is that gross scott why are they

431
00:15:39,295 --> 00:15:40,795
the worst bets i need to know

432
00:15:40,825 --> 00:15:42,775
mike my carnival fish it had such

433
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:45,805
a dirty bowl that it while i

434
00:15:45,805 --> 00:15:47,395
was sleeping it jumped out of the

435
00:15:47,395 --> 00:15:48,775
bowl and onto me and it was

436
00:15:48,775 --> 00:15:53,125
like kill me like you just wanted

437
00:15:54,175 --> 00:15:56,455
thirty water please snuggle with me they're

438
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:57,823
just so grossing that i get that

439
00:15:57,823 --> 00:16:00,595
i still can smell that smell of

440
00:16:00,595 --> 00:16:02,695
the cleaning the tank and the shit

441
00:16:02,695 --> 00:16:05,035
and yeah imagine if if like there

442
00:16:05,035 --> 00:16:07,945
was such bad air pollution that you

443
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:10,705
killed yourself yeah you'd just like joe

444
00:16:10,705 --> 00:16:12,505
duffy or i could drown i'm gonna

445
00:16:12,505 --> 00:16:13,675
drown i'm going to go make the

446
00:16:13,675 --> 00:16:14,005
ocean

447
00:16:15,955 --> 00:16:17,065
this sucks

448
00:16:18,415 --> 00:16:20,065
i wish you didn't think it was

449
00:16:20,065 --> 00:16:22,315
ever jumped off the earth do you

450
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:25,015
think he would be so rad that

451
00:16:25,015 --> 00:16:26,845
if you let me so dealer yom

452
00:16:26,845 --> 00:16:28,569
you jumped in the air you go

453
00:16:28,615 --> 00:16:32,515
to space probably there is that that

454
00:16:32,605 --> 00:16:34,795
what's the thing about jumping like if

455
00:16:34,795 --> 00:16:37,855
the elevator starts plunging oh yeah

456
00:16:37,915 --> 00:16:39,265
right before you make a bomb joe

457
00:16:39,265 --> 00:16:41,335
biden all the time when i know

458
00:16:41,335 --> 00:16:42,685
it's not it's not for plunging it's

459
00:16:42,685 --> 00:16:43,945
like you can do it when you're

460
00:16:43,945 --> 00:16:45,415
um i mean it is for that

461
00:16:45,415 --> 00:16:46,615
but don't do it as a fun

462
00:16:46,615 --> 00:16:48,655
thing to feel like you're flying for

463
00:16:48,655 --> 00:16:50,665
a second when the elevator is coming

464
00:16:50,665 --> 00:16:51,865
to a i mean maybe it's something

465
00:16:51,865 --> 00:16:53,125
that just works with your kid but

466
00:16:53,515 --> 00:16:55,675
when the elevator is coming to a

467
00:16:55,705 --> 00:16:57,295
halt at the floor right before it

468
00:16:57,295 --> 00:16:57,925
does you go you

469
00:16:58,015 --> 00:16:59,335
jump and then you are basically in

470
00:16:59,335 --> 00:17:01,165
the air like an extra second but

471
00:17:01,165 --> 00:17:01,615
paula

472
00:17:02,935 --> 00:17:04,345
the the thing i'm talking about is

473
00:17:04,345 --> 00:17:05,545
a thing where there's like an herb

474
00:17:06,205 --> 00:17:08,575
you to know your god i know

475
00:17:08,575 --> 00:17:10,135
the thing you're talking about it was

476
00:17:10,135 --> 00:17:13,075
lauren that interrupted it i'm just sharing

477
00:17:13,105 --> 00:17:14,455
other information

478
00:17:15,595 --> 00:17:18,475
how dare you i'm born i want

479
00:17:18,475 --> 00:17:20,185
to make sure that you didn't just

480
00:17:20,185 --> 00:17:22,525
gloss over my thing and i never

481
00:17:22,555 --> 00:17:24,205
wanted to ask questions about god i

482
00:17:24,205 --> 00:17:26,815
never aware i never would gloss over

483
00:17:26,815 --> 00:17:28,165
anything anyone says in the show i

484
00:17:28,165 --> 00:17:29,305
don't want to skip ahead and or

485
00:17:29,305 --> 00:17:30,745
and here's the idea here's here's the

486
00:17:30,745 --> 00:17:34,165
full cost of your elders that if

487
00:17:34,195 --> 00:17:35,515
let's say the elevator is it

488
00:17:35,695 --> 00:17:37,015
it snaps it's cables and you're like

489
00:17:37,255 --> 00:17:39,925
oh and then you go you know

490
00:17:39,925 --> 00:17:42,265
what floor you got on you know

491
00:17:42,265 --> 00:17:44,605
what floor when the cable snapped and

492
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:46,825
so all you have to do is

493
00:17:47,125 --> 00:17:50,095
count just like guess the distance and

494
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:52,345
the velocity so it's like thunder lightning

495
00:17:52,345 --> 00:17:55,375
sort of count the second verse and

496
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:55,855
then you get

497
00:17:55,885 --> 00:17:57,505
to the bottom like right before you

498
00:17:57,505 --> 00:17:59,155
get to the bottom just jump in

499
00:17:59,155 --> 00:18:02,275
there and that's really supposed to stop

500
00:18:02,275 --> 00:18:04,525
the damage from breaking your bones and

501
00:18:04,525 --> 00:18:05,965
squishing into a size of a can

502
00:18:05,965 --> 00:18:09,235
of soup exactly but what does it

503
00:18:09,235 --> 00:18:11,095
what does the physics about it like

504
00:18:11,095 --> 00:18:13,615
why would that work supposedly because you

505
00:18:13,615 --> 00:18:15,175
are not hitting you're not hitting the

506
00:18:15,175 --> 00:18:16,015
ground when the

507
00:18:16,105 --> 00:18:17,155
thing is hitting the ground so it's

508
00:18:17,155 --> 00:18:18,415
like you're not feeling the pressure of

509
00:18:18,415 --> 00:18:20,305
that yeah but you're still gonna fall

510
00:18:20,305 --> 00:18:22,375
to the ground one millisecond later yeah

511
00:18:22,525 --> 00:18:24,805
we're crashing here with the same force

512
00:18:24,805 --> 00:18:28,195
of yes you're also fully yeah i

513
00:18:28,195 --> 00:18:29,785
also wonder if you would even be

514
00:18:29,815 --> 00:18:33,325
able to jump because the velocity of

515
00:18:33,325 --> 00:18:34,945
ah i'm sure you know and and

516
00:18:34,945 --> 00:18:36,175
by the way you're so scare

517
00:18:36,175 --> 00:18:37,435
hard you're not going i gotta jump

518
00:18:37,435 --> 00:18:39,535
in eight seven sit no no no

519
00:18:39,595 --> 00:18:41,005
i'm i'm wetting my pants and i'm

520
00:18:41,005 --> 00:18:42,715
going mommy mommy mommy i love yeah

521
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:45,025
yeah although you're telling me though that

522
00:18:45,276 --> 00:18:47,425
this conversation wouldn't flash into your mind

523
00:18:47,425 --> 00:18:49,465
and you wouldn't just try it look

524
00:18:49,825 --> 00:18:52,705
if it happened i would definitely have

525
00:18:52,705 --> 00:18:53,785
this flash in my mind and i

526
00:18:53,815 --> 00:18:56,245
definitely try it if i tried it

527
00:18:56,905 --> 00:18:57,985
and i'm not saying that i did

528
00:18:58,375 --> 00:19:02,755
but i lived whoa it's it's real

529
00:19:02,755 --> 00:19:03,835
it's real and i tried at night

530
00:19:04,015 --> 00:19:05,065
and i did not die and you

531
00:19:05,065 --> 00:19:07,465
die wow yeah i'm dead guys did

532
00:19:07,465 --> 00:19:09,205
you see that video of the guy

533
00:19:09,205 --> 00:19:10,525
who jumped out of the plane and

534
00:19:10,525 --> 00:19:13,885
his parachute didn't open yeah anyway cover

535
00:19:13,885 --> 00:19:15,632
by peter gabriel oh no i'm talking

536
00:19:15,632 --> 00:19:16,495
about a different thing actually

537
00:19:16,495 --> 00:19:17,725
we know the one that i saw

538
00:19:17,725 --> 00:19:19,675
was a guy who like his friend

539
00:19:19,675 --> 00:19:22,045
was taping him falling to the ground

540
00:19:22,045 --> 00:19:23,335
like oh yeah i'm going to tape

541
00:19:23,335 --> 00:19:25,435
you parachuting out of this airplane but

542
00:19:25,435 --> 00:19:27,685
the guy's chute didn't open and he

543
00:19:27,895 --> 00:19:29,185
fell on the ground and the guy

544
00:19:29,275 --> 00:19:30,445
then the guy taping him is like

545
00:19:30,445 --> 00:19:32,005
holy shit oh no and runs up

546
00:19:32,005 --> 00:19:33,085
to him and the guy gets up

547
00:19:33,085 --> 00:19:35,545
and is like oh my god oh

548
00:19:35,545 --> 00:19:36,615
my god i can't believe

549
00:19:36,685 --> 00:19:39,505
i'm still alive oh my god and

550
00:19:39,505 --> 00:19:41,395
he like gets up and walks away

551
00:19:41,395 --> 00:19:44,215

story about this youtube guy who flew

556
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:55,915
a small plane crashed the pretended it

557
00:19:55,915 --> 00:19:56,815

00:19:58,465 --> 00:20:00,625
it filming himself yeah and then i

560
00:20:00,625 --> 00:20:02,485
see the plane just he did shit

561
00:20:02,485 --> 00:20:04,915
it just fell into the fuckin mountains

562
00:20:05,635 --> 00:20:08,425
ah but yeah for for this was

563
00:20:08,425 --> 00:20:10,705
video he did this he faked please

564
00:20:10,765 --> 00:20:15,955
wasn't problematic he had a ah full

565
00:20:15,955 --> 00:20:16,975
of deviation lie

566
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:19,065
and all this stuff of like mayday

567
00:20:19,065 --> 00:20:20,595
mayday it's crashing and all that kind

568
00:20:20,595 --> 00:20:21,525
of stuff and then why didn't you

569
00:20:21,525 --> 00:20:23,535
just all of that i think so

570
00:20:23,565 --> 00:20:25,155
and then he parachuted out of it

571
00:20:25,185 --> 00:20:27,615
um and videoed the whole thing for

572
00:20:27,615 --> 00:20:29,235
youtube and then they figured out later

573
00:20:29,235 --> 00:20:30,675
it was a stunt and he crashed

574
00:20:30,675 --> 00:20:33,075
the plane intentionally and so they you

575
00:20:33,075 --> 00:20:35,295
know revoked his license maybe he's going

576
00:20:35,295 --> 00:20:36,465
to be rested i have no idea

577
00:20:36,495 --> 00:20:37,785
he should be arrested because you could

578
00:20:37,785 --> 00:20:39,525
i have heard someone yeah yeah of

579
00:20:39,525 --> 00:20:42,075
course next plane could crashed into mount

580
00:20:42,075 --> 00:20:42,615
rushmore

581
00:20:43,455 --> 00:20:44,856
and i will be honest day because

582
00:20:44,856 --> 00:20:46,215
it locked his beard off can you

583
00:20:46,215 --> 00:20:49,365
imagine i think youtube should d monetize

584
00:20:49,365 --> 00:20:52,215
his videos that's real punishment like he

585
00:20:52,215 --> 00:20:54,315
should be paying us to watch his

586
00:20:54,315 --> 00:20:56,745
videos yes and he has to do

587
00:20:56,745 --> 00:20:58,185
and there's going to be ads where

588
00:20:58,185 --> 00:21:01,035
he it's just him apologizing yeah to

589
00:21:01,035 --> 00:21:02,865

608
00:21:34,455 --> 00:21:35,685
all very new to me and i

609
00:21:35,685 --> 00:21:36,825
looked at what some other people were

00:21:36,825 --> 00:21:38,475
charging and i'm like oh well yeah

611
00:21:38,505 --> 00:21:40,065
that person has to charge that because

00:21:40,095 --> 00:21:42,015
otherwise they would be inundated with ah

613
00:21:42,045 --> 00:21:45,039
with requests yeah and um and so

614
00:21:45,238 --> 00:21:47,925
i started at fifty and then ah

615
00:21:48,045 --> 00:21:48,555
i was

616
00:21:49,965 --> 00:21:52,845
i was told by my person that

617
00:21:52,905 --> 00:21:56,055
cameo ah that i were a broker

618
00:21:56,055 --> 00:22:00,195

619
00:22:00,195 --> 00:22:03,182
ever join cameo yes they simply i

620
00:22:03,255 --> 00:22:05,835
don't say yeah but it's hurtful to

621
00:22:05,835 --> 00:22:07,635
hear we want to get into the

622
00:22:07,635 --> 00:22:08,640
numbers jameson

623
00:22:09,015 --> 00:22:10,125
really good for it too and then

624
00:22:10,125 --> 00:22:11,265
when she said yeah you're the dumbest

625
00:22:11,265 --> 00:22:13,365
person and i was like oh why

626
00:22:13,365 --> 00:22:15,735
did you call me oh i'm busy

627
00:22:15,825 --> 00:22:16,845
i was asleep

628
00:22:18,525 --> 00:22:22,155
but there were so many people requesting

629
00:22:22,155 --> 00:22:23,535
you in a very short amount time

630
00:22:23,535 --> 00:22:25,605
that cameo had you raise the price

631
00:22:25,635 --> 00:22:26,955
or they raised the price for yeah

632
00:22:26,985 --> 00:22:28,455
they said i want to do yeah

633
00:22:28,485 --> 00:22:29,295
they said you want to raise the

634
00:22:29,295 --> 00:22:31,275
price and i was like yes yeah

635
00:22:31,275 --> 00:22:32,715
because it's so much to do you'll

636
00:22:32,715 --> 00:22:34,275
never have time if you don't you

637
00:22:34,275 --> 00:22:35,595
know you have to kind of curb

638
00:22:35,595 --> 00:22:37,185

639
00:22:37,185 --> 00:22:37,815

cameos for space so funny my god

747
00:26:16,605 --> 00:26:19,275
he's still amazing that should be the

748
00:26:19,335 --> 00:26:21,735
like the story on a situation comedy

749
00:26:21,945 --> 00:26:23,835
honestly like the two people get each

750
00:26:23,835 --> 00:26:25,695
other same cameo this fucking alert they

751
00:26:25,695 --> 00:26:27,555
should do a skit on s l

752
00:26:28,005 --> 00:26:28,905
and you should do is say should

753
00:26:28,905 --> 00:26:30,645
do one skid on s and l

754
00:26:30,855 --> 00:26:33,435
for once i get on that i

755
00:26:33,435 --> 00:26:35,355
think a black lady sketch show should

756
00:26:35,355 --> 00:26:36,585
do it it should last

757
00:26:36,585 --> 00:26:37,815
shampoo in it and send it out

758
00:26:38,265 --> 00:26:39,885
they should do a spoof of that

759
00:26:39,915 --> 00:26:41,385
what's another sketch show are there any

760
00:26:41,925 --> 00:26:43,755
i think it's more of our lampoon

761
00:26:43,755 --> 00:26:44,235
idea

762
00:26:45,765 --> 00:26:46,785
i don't know if there really are

763
00:26:46,785 --> 00:26:48,495
any right now besides the ones we've

764
00:26:48,495 --> 00:26:50,171
mentioned black lady sketch show us oh

765
00:26:50,171 --> 00:26:52,605
and what else ah just is harvard

766
00:26:52,605 --> 00:26:54,195
level and i think you should leave

767
00:26:54,195 --> 00:26:55,725
of course i think you should leave

768
00:26:55,755 --> 00:26:58,425
could you imagine tim robinson with his

769
00:26:58,425 --> 00:27:01,425
trademark heightening of frustrations so that he

770
00:27:01,425 --> 00:27:04,455
can really send it up he could

771
00:27:04,515 --> 00:27:05,625
do a goof

772
00:27:05,625 --> 00:27:07,065
on that that would be for the

773
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:09,345
ages how do we hold in a

774
00:27:09,362 --> 00:27:11,655
skid on that where he had two

775
00:27:11,655 --> 00:27:13,665
people get the same cameo for each

776
00:27:13,665 --> 00:27:15,555
other and then they did that on

777
00:27:15,555 --> 00:27:18,045
this show that'd be freaking bomb dude

778
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:20,175
i mean obviously we should be in

779
00:27:20,175 --> 00:27:23,955

ah comedy game show in england they

792
00:27:51,735 --> 00:27:52,665
did a season of it here but

793
00:27:52,665 --> 00:27:56,025
it didn't take reggie hosted it yeah

794
00:27:56,055 --> 00:27:57,825
which was that was a strange choice

795
00:27:57,855 --> 00:27:59,745
now that i'm doing what now that

796
00:27:59,745 --> 00:28:02,475
i've seen the original show is a

797
00:28:02,535 --> 00:28:03,945
it is an and of course i

798
00:28:03,945 --> 00:28:05,625
watched i watched the first episode of

799
00:28:05,625 --> 00:28:05,835
the

800
00:28:06,195 --> 00:28:07,695
the british version of the the american

801
00:28:07,695 --> 00:28:10,245
version and it's so you can so

802
00:28:10,245 --> 00:28:12,195
clearly see the difference between what they

803
00:28:12,195 --> 00:28:16,245
think the american attention span is versus

804
00:28:16,275 --> 00:28:19,095
anywhere else we think we're just a

805
00:28:19,095 --> 00:28:21,165
bunch of dumb shits like we don't

chavez went ape shit on wow and

00:30:40,085 --> 00:30:42,575
he literally she was like i have

863
00:30:42,575 --> 00:30:45,485
a recording in thirty minutes and i

864
00:30:45,485 --> 00:30:46,325
don't know how

865
00:30:46,385 --> 00:30:47,975
this is gonna work and he started

866
00:30:47,975 --> 00:30:49,475
crying and he started screaming and he

867
00:30:49,475 --> 00:30:50,705
was like i am the host of

868
00:30:50,705 --> 00:30:52,475
the zoom this is kinda like everything

869
00:30:52,475 --> 00:30:55,145
yeah yeah that's a good impression he

870
00:30:55,145 --> 00:30:57,155
kept yelling how he was the host

871
00:30:57,155 --> 00:30:58,265
of the zoom they're like no no

872
00:30:58,265 --> 00:30:59,735
one was disputing up by yeah no

873
00:30:59,735 --> 00:31:01,025
one but it's almost like it was

874
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:02,165
trying to make it like he was

875
00:31:02,165 --> 00:31:04,955
the host of this podcast like yeah

876
00:31:04,985 --> 00:31:06,485
troll shit

877
00:31:06,575 --> 00:31:07,925
wait guys do you think that he

878
00:31:07,925 --> 00:31:10,265
thinks when he hosted the zoom that

879
00:31:10,265 --> 00:31:11,825
makes him the host of the show

880
00:31:11,975 --> 00:31:13,775
i think he doesn't understand what that

881
00:31:13,775 --> 00:31:14,915
means yeah i think he might mean

882
00:31:14,915 --> 00:31:16,535
we do give him all the money

883
00:31:16,535 --> 00:31:19,685
from all the ads we sell yeah

884
00:31:20,165 --> 00:31:21,395
he does she may have done that

885
00:31:21,575 --> 00:31:23,885
he does do a transcription of everything

886
00:31:23,885 --> 00:31:25,205
we say and then he imitates the

887
00:31:25,205 --> 00:31:26,615
three of us and he

888
00:31:26,645 --> 00:31:28,565
put out a separate show where he

889
00:31:28,565 --> 00:31:30,245
does all the voice calls me oh

890
00:31:30,245 --> 00:31:32,015

919
00:32:31,265 --> 00:32:33,155
when we found out that you there

920
00:32:33,155 --> 00:32:34,325
was a program on it where you

921
00:32:34,325 --> 00:32:35,825
could type something in and make the

922
00:32:35,825 --> 00:32:38,703
computer say yes dirty words that it

923
00:32:38,703 --> 00:32:41,765
was so selfless ap very fun course

924
00:32:41,795 --> 00:32:45,365
who doesn't love that piss piss shit

925
00:32:45,695 --> 00:32:46,895
but of course it was like shit

926
00:32:46,985 --> 00:32:47,255
is

927
00:32:47,285 --> 00:32:49,805
oregon trail course classic when you would

928
00:32:49,805 --> 00:32:52,985
put in that um people's names you

929
00:32:52,985 --> 00:32:53,825
know you've got to make up a

930
00:32:53,825 --> 00:32:55,715
name in the game and you can

931
00:32:55,715 --> 00:32:58,265
name your family and then um you

932
00:32:58,265 --> 00:32:59,705
always put penis then at some point

933
00:32:59,705 --> 00:33:01,925
penis gets killed by snakebite and then

934
00:33:01,925 --> 00:33:04,415
it's like let's just say i never

935
00:33:04,475 --> 00:33:06,425
played oregon trail that was after my

936
00:33:06,425 --> 00:33:07,385
time and i'm not

937
00:33:07,475 --> 00:33:08,825
quite sure it was just like a

938
00:33:08,825 --> 00:33:11,255
text game right now i mean it

939
00:33:11,255 --> 00:33:13,595
was there were visuals like i know

940
00:33:13,595 --> 00:33:15,575
that you died of dysentery okay today

941
00:33:16,295 --> 00:33:17,975
so like you have your family and

942
00:33:17,975 --> 00:33:19,355
you have your covered wagon and you'd

943
00:33:19,373 --> 00:33:20,435
see like an image of that and

944
00:33:20,435 --> 00:33:22,025
then like you the wagons trying to

945
00:33:22,025 --> 00:33:23,375
like do various things and you choose

946
00:33:23,375 --> 00:33:24,785
what it's gonna do is going afford

947
00:33:24,785 --> 00:33:27,005
the river or is it gonna cock

948
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:27,605
the wheel

949
00:33:27,605 --> 00:33:28,505
rules are i don't know what there's

950
00:33:28,505 --> 00:33:30,185
different things that i just learned from

951
00:33:30,185 --> 00:33:32,195
the game and then you want to

952
00:33:32,195 --> 00:33:33,275
do the thing and either fails or

953
00:33:33,305 --> 00:33:35,525
succeeds and if like all of us

954
00:33:35,585 --> 00:33:36,695
and then some of the things might

955
00:33:36,695 --> 00:33:38,285
die and then you go hunting and

956
00:33:38,285 --> 00:33:39,635
there's that's always the fun part you

957
00:33:39,635 --> 00:33:40,715
get to use your little gun and

958
00:33:40,715 --> 00:33:44,315
you shoot the bison and then there's

959
00:33:44,315 --> 00:33:45,755
her squirrels and other things that are

960
00:33:45,755 --> 00:33:47,495
worthless you know food points

961
00:33:47,885 --> 00:33:49,655
and agreed you kill as many as

962
00:33:49,655 --> 00:33:50,855
you can but then sometimes like the

963
00:33:50,975 --> 00:33:52,325
you shot too much you can't carry

964
00:33:52,325 --> 00:33:53,652
at all so you don't wanna be

965
00:33:53,652 --> 00:33:56,975
wasteful with your bullets and um yeah

966
00:33:56,975 --> 00:33:57,785
and then at the end you see

967
00:33:57,785 --> 00:33:59,855
your group grave or you win i

968
00:33:59,855 --> 00:34:02,255
don't recall ever succeeding honestly use this

969
00:34:02,255 --> 00:34:05,255
crazy wave yeah it's so crazy you

970
00:34:05,255 --> 00:34:07,475
can carry bullets and they're so light

971
00:34:07,475 --> 00:34:07,925
but then the

972
00:34:07,955 --> 00:34:10,325
things they kill are so heavy this

973
00:34:10,325 --> 00:34:12,305
is so deep dude you should write

974
00:34:12,335 --> 00:34:15,005
a book isn't it funny how abraham

975
00:34:15,005 --> 00:34:16,715
lincoln was our tallest president but he's

976
00:34:16,715 --> 00:34:18,005
on such a tiny little coin

977
00:34:19,985 --> 00:34:24,485
dude oh my god dude that's fucking

978
00:34:24,695 --> 00:34:27,035
isn't it insane how george washington was

979
00:34:27,035 --> 00:34:28,775
three-dimensional and yet on the on the

980
00:34:28,775 --> 00:34:31,715
darvill he's just flat it's like what's

981
00:34:31,865 --> 00:34:33,785
that supposed to mean i do think

982
00:34:33,785 --> 00:34:35,345
when i was a kid i used

983
00:34:35,345 --> 00:34:37,295
to think that okay george washington was

984
00:34:37,295 --> 00:34:38,825
the first president so he was on

985
00:34:38,825 --> 00:34:39,365
the one dollar

986
00:34:39,365 --> 00:34:41,975
or bill not means abraham lincoln was

987
00:34:41,975 --> 00:34:43,625
our fifth president because i think i

988
00:34:43,625 --> 00:34:45,155
thought that too at one point yeah

989
00:34:45,455 --> 00:34:46,295
i think in some ways they should

990
00:34:46,295 --> 00:34:48,245
have done that it makes more sense

991
00:34:48,245 --> 00:34:49,655
like make a make a different bill

992
00:34:49,655 --> 00:34:51,305
for every single president we have so

993
00:34:51,305 --> 00:34:53,135
the sixteen dollar bill there'd be a

994
00:34:53,135 --> 00:34:54,425
fully six dollar bill there was a

995
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:56,885
sixteen dollars just made me feel weird

996
00:34:56,885 --> 00:34:59,165
inside how much is that sixteen dollars

997
00:34:59,195 --> 00:34:59,405
oh

998
00:34:59,525 --> 00:35:02,795
good like your sixteen dollar bill and

999
00:35:02,795 --> 00:35:05,105
you were like legally obligated to carry

1000
00:35:05,105 --> 00:35:07,925
every and like one of each bill

1001
00:35:07,955 --> 00:35:11,645
everywhere legally high yeah there how much

1002
00:35:11,645 --> 00:35:13,925
that's how much money would that be

1003
00:35:13,925 --> 00:35:15,485
i mean it's already kind of sixteen

1004
00:35:15,485 --> 00:35:17,195
dollar bill then you have to replenish

1005
00:35:17,195 --> 00:35:18,845
a sixteen dollar bill yeah but that's

1006
00:35:18,845 --> 00:35:19,685
already ninety one

1007
00:35:19,685 --> 00:35:21,245
one dollars just with our two most

1008
00:35:21,245 --> 00:35:23,615
recent presidents but imagine wow you might

1009
00:35:23,615 --> 00:35:25,475
hundred and thirty imagine yeah imagine carrying

1010
00:35:25,475 --> 00:35:27,695
legalizing fifty one dollar bills it takes

1011
00:35:27,695 --> 00:35:30,365
up a lot of room yeah so

1012
00:35:30,365 --> 00:35:32,525

1131
00:39:36,155 --> 00:39:38,435
bring it back to currency but humor

1132
00:39:38,435 --> 00:39:40,115
when two dollar bills were like exciting

1133
00:39:40,385 --> 00:39:43,265
oh it's still exciting thrilling to me

1134
00:39:43,265 --> 00:39:45,335
i do receive them quite regularly because

1135
00:39:45,335 --> 00:39:46,085
my my family

1136
00:39:46,085 --> 00:39:47,585
early it is ah oh it's a

1137
00:39:47,585 --> 00:39:49,055
thing in the time where you guys

1138
00:39:49,085 --> 00:39:51,215
collect all this swing you know where

1139
00:39:51,215 --> 00:39:52,895
i would get them all the time

1140
00:39:53,045 --> 00:39:57,275
is universal studios parking anytime i would

00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:44,010
with people who are like this is

1251
00:43:44,010 --> 00:43:45,270

any of my friends again yeah and

1253
00:43:47,430 --> 00:43:49,260

00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:49,470
anyway

1255
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:52,890
i know well i mean it's still

1256
00:43:53,190 --> 00:43:54,450
what i feel like the world has

1257
00:43:54,450 --> 00:43:57,120
shifted in a different way where well

1258
00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:59,130
even now we're all homebodies now there's

1259
00:43:59,130 --> 00:44:00,180
a lot of there's a lot of

1260
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:02,310
that and then there's also like now

1261
00:44:02,310 --> 00:44:04,080
that the work is picking up or

1262
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:05,700
maybe it has been whole time everyone's

1263
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:08,100
on different paths with this but that

1264
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:10,200
like you prioritize your time so different

1265
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:12,060
tlie like i feel like people aren't

1266
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:13,740
filling their day going thing the thing

1267
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:15,330
the thing it's like you're kind of

1268
00:44:16,230 --> 00:44:17,220
i don't know i that's what it

1269
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:18,660
seems like my people in my world

1270
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:20,790
are doing so you've they're doing their

1271
00:44:20,790 --> 00:44:22,440
whole day from thing to not a

1272
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:23,820
thing no like it's more like think

1273
00:44:23,829 --> 00:44:25,590
they do fewer things during the day

1274
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:27,510
when they did before the pandemic where

1275
00:44:27,510 --> 00:44:29,400
it was more like roadshow outside it's

1276
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:30,360
not going from thing

1277
00:44:30,390 --> 00:44:31,530
to not a thing then to a

1278
00:44:31,530 --> 00:44:33,270
thing that i guess that is what

1279
00:44:33,270 --> 00:44:35,670
