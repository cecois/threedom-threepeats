00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:34,590
york in the nineties and then i'm

122
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:36,180
wondering today tell you about the restaurant

123
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:37,045
i went to the ninety s in

124
00:04:37,045 --> 00:04:39,555
new york restaurants my ears oh no

125
00:04:39,568 --> 00:04:42,540
no you couldn't scan signal in this

126
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:44,130
guy you couldn't work there scott because

127
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:45,390
it was called twins and all the

128
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:48,390
servers were twin no no yes why

129
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:50,310
remember very distinctly it was very exciting

130
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,160
and it's very safe i was a

131
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,360
kid i was a kid so i

132
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,520
will do anyway if ty ten and

133
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,200
this was in new york city yeah

134
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,150
if two twins couldn't make it with

135
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:01,440
they have to cover their shift with

136
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,604
two other twins yeah just yeah i

137
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:05,310
guess it's just like if you can't

138
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:06,660
if one can't make it one can't

139
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:07,830
work because there's no point in just

140
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:09,600
having one twin walking around was it

141
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:11,520
only the servers or was it eh

142
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,498

00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:16,080
front of house front of house yeah

145
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:17,520
i think it was only the servers

146
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:18,900
that's but you know again i was

147
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:21,120
a child kind if it was everyone

148
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:24,330
the busboys the dishwashers that lauren this

149
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:26,220

152
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,000
an idea that you had as a

153
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,410
child and it's been so long you've

154
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:31,680

156
00:05:32,976 --> 00:05:34,740
i remember being there i actually thought

00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:36,270
it was really cool it opened a

158
00:05:36,355 --> 00:05:38,370
ninety four on the upper east side

159
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:40,590
it consisted of twenty nine sets of

160
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:42,750
identical twins who worked as hostesses bartenders

161
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:45,060

166
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:56,640
get in there housing involved in fact

167
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,930

168
00:05:57,930 --> 00:05:59,310
worked there full-time the chef and the

169
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:01,800
general manager it took us only two

170
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,970
weeks to find enough twins to work

171
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:04,800
here we've had twins quit their full-time

172
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,090
day jobs work here it's not about

173
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:07,710
money it's about the twin thing

174
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,970
i mean you gotta split all of

175
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:13,890
your unless unless people are tipping you

176
00:06:13,890 --> 00:06:16,501

177
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:17,940
up their earnings with here's what a

178
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:19,740
fan wrote twins sounds like a pretty

179
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,750
silly gimmick until you get there when

180
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:22,950
you're greeted at the door by two

181
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:25,470
gorgeous identical hostesses and glance at the

182
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:26,940
bar to find two identical men pouring

183
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:28,590
drinks and you begins to grow on

184
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:28,860
you

185
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:31,080
this is a person who's just realising

186
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:31,890
they're bisexual

187
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,560

this is i mean it's our version

267
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:26,400
of a clip show you ever watch

268
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:29,310
a sitcom they get a york the

269
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:31,410
money remember when we were growing up

270
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:34,500
flashback to five years ago the money

271
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,280
was running out on the

272
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:36,810
sitcom all they could afford to do

273
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:38,730
was like ten minutes of a show

274
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:39,930
and then the other twenty minutes of

275
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:41,520
the show was clips that's what we're

276
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,590
doing today was it a monetary thing

277
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:44,582
is that why they did it or

278
00:09:44,582 --> 00:09:46,200
it was just that they there was

279
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:48,660
altogether like the corporation yeah but i

280
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:49,620
mean i think it was usually a

281
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:52,260
monetary thing um but isn't that so

282
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:54,300
ridiculous when they lived together like an

283
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:55,440
edited episode just

284
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,640
like fran but i guess when you

285
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,900
don't have access to all the episodes

286
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,310
you're like oh yeah remember that one

287
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:00,895
but wait a second would the cast

288
00:10:00,895 --> 00:10:03,000
get paid like when they prorate their

289
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,490
salaries do because they'd be in the

290
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:07,530
episode being like hey i hit my

291
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:08,910
head i don't remember anything like i

292
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:09,810
feel like we ever tell you about

293
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:11,580
something everyone got paid the same amount

294
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:12,900
of money but maybe it was like

295
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:15,570
shorter to shoot in the writers well

296
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,770
shooting the crew and all that the

297
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:20,930
lights ah you don't have to buy

298
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:22,160
pizza for the audience

299
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:24,830
but we have bought pizza for each

300
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:26,930
other yeah and it's all getting delivered

301
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:28,850
simultaneously at the end of the episode

302
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:30,650
which yes really really rise each other

303
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:32,690
with pizza and no one knows what

304
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:34,070
kind of pizza they're gonna get and

305
00:10:34,070 --> 00:10:35,300
no one knows who gave each other

306
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:37,460
the pizza but we'll figure it out

307
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,130
secret santa pizza you guys can try

308
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:42,050
at this secret santa song is a

309
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:43,340
concept that's good

310
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,680
you know we really should start secret

311
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,660
santa pizza yeah we should what what

312
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:50,210
happens people show up they don't order

313
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:52,130
they just get whatever we give them

314
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:53,120
and then they have to give us

315
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,040
pizza back oh i thought that it

316
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,390
was this was like a concept that

317
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:58,190
anyone could do but oh no i

318
00:10:58,220 --> 00:10:59,570
do us no i think that we

319
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:01,370
just started a business okay as a

320
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,990
business yeah see

321
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:03,890
huh

322
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:06,560
but now that the the secrets the

323
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:08,360
concept of secret santa is that you

324
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:10,070
know you're going to get something you

325
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:11,000
don't know who it's going to be

326
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,160
from okay but you also don't know

327
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:15,380
what you're gonna get true but i'm

328
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:16,820
saying you people have to know that

329
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:19,010
they're getting a pizza and i'm getting

330
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:20,330
a pizza they just don't know which

331
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:21,980
of the chefs is making it for

332
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:23,150
them and they don't know what the

333
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:24,530
pizza is that isn't

334
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:26,060
ready the way it is except a

335
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:27,530
day or two there or they will

336
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:30,410
know they can't order something specific and

337
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:31,790
then they have to give a full

338
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:34,490
pizza back to the restaurant ah ha

339
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:36,380
and is a pizza weird or is

340
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:37,880
it just like you got cheese

341
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:43,280
ah lauren has put on fake sunglasses

342
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,920
sunglasses you've got decent with some nice

343
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:48,680
toner gloves on a a virtual sunglasses

344
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:50,840
will look this is a clip show

345
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,880
and we decided not to do a

346
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,470
clip show of just this would be

347
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:56,660
boring clip shift just our show of

348
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:58,880
our show of the previous episode

349
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:01,640
oh now we're at a museum i've

350
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,780
never seen this

351
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:05,900
but we decided not to do not

352
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:08,330
to do clips of of previous episodes

353
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:09,830
of of our show because over the

354
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:12,170
past nine weeks we've been airing reruns

355
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:14,780
of the show with new intros done

356
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:17,960
by us ninties and then we started

357
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,010
to think about it and we said

358
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:20,900
you know what all of those intros

359
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:23,000
are going to go away and they're

360
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,170
all going to be lost to them

361
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:26,810
waste of time yeah um because they're

362
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:28,160
not going to be in an episode

363
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,230
so what if we did a full

364
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:33,020
episode where you listen to these intros

365
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:35,570
back to back yeah exactly so back-to-back

366
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:38,510
to back-to-back tibet freaking crazy and it's

367
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:40,610
also simultaneously going to be on marvel's

368
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:41,300
what if

369
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:44,060
can you imagine a world where this

370
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:44,510
would happen

371
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:50,180
but the the process of doing these

372
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:51,710
ou

373
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,213
i would love la la la la

374
00:12:54,213 --> 00:12:54,350
but

375
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:57,650
the muslim of the process is doing

376
00:12:57,650 --> 00:12:59,090
these because yes let's get into it

377
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,220
i listened to this earlier today and

378
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:04,670
it's basically we we recorded these quite

379
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:05,750
a few at a time and over

380
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:07,520
yeah over the time period that we

381
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:10,490
did these we slowly that in the

382
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:12,740
first one we get off track but

383
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:14,210
then we slowly lose interest in the

384
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:15,530
concept of introducing

385
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,870
these episodes and we just talk about

386
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:19,190
random stuff now do you think it's

387
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:20,720
that we lose interest in it or

388
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,070
do you think it's that we forget

389
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:23,060
that that's what we're supposed to be

390
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:25,160
doing maybe maybe when the three of

391
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,540
us get together we just forget what

392
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:28,580
because it's very talking about twins i

393
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:30,200
could've gone on and on i didn't

394
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,400
care what our plan was

395
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:39,650
everywhere

396
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:42,980
learn are you putting these on or

397
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,620
i am okay if i'm playing with

398
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:48,170
the zoom feature lawrence addicted to filter

399
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:51,350
she can't stop i just can't see

400
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:52,430
myself i really am

401
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:57,080
but we are desperately trying to claw

402
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:59,300
this back okay good luck go for

403
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:02,060
it let's see what happens so do

404
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:03,560
you guys what are your memories of

405
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:05,630
doing these intros oh man i remember

406
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:07,790
all times because i really i really

407
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:09,110
do i really do i remember all

408
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:10,460
these times and i remember him and

409
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:12,050
they were so good yeah and it

410
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:13,550
was so nice how we did

411
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:15,140
them and i think one of the

412
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:17,300
best things about it was the ways

413
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:19,190
in which we talked about stuff because

414
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:20,180
i think when we would kind of

415
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:21,230
just break it down and kind of

416
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:22,760
get into stuff a lot of good

417
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:23,900
stuff would come out and it's stuff

418
00:14:23,912 --> 00:14:25,700
we learned i couldn't agree more i

419
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:27,560
think that the memory i have is

420
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,660
sitting in this chair looking at this

421
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:32,210
laptop and talking to youtube

422
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:35,000
what were your favorite parts i thought

423
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,280
the sentences were really good i liked

424
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:39,140
the beginning middle and end and there

425
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:41,450
were parts some parts in the before

426
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:42,860
the middle before the end that i

427
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:45,050
wasn't quite as keen on but right

428
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:47,090
yeah i see that i liked the

429
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:50,900
content yeah i liked i liked everything

430
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:53,120
that was within them it will say

431
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:56,120
and um i'm excluding everything that was

432
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:58,970
not in them yeah to the extent

433
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:00,410
that i liked what was in them

434
00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:02,180
i do think you know we're seeing

435
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:03,170
a lot of people have a lot

436
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:05,990
of success with doing podcasts about tv

437
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:08,660
shows the third i'm not against doing

438
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:10,520
a podcast about this podcast that's right

439
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:11,990
and we're doing it whatever episode of

440
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:13,550
the podcast we talk about

441
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:14,960
we reflect on what it was like

442
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,850
and we talk about what happened something

443
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:18,560
funny that happened behind the scenes maybe

444
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:20,450
someone's computer wouldn't start we're not only

445
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,800
broke we're not the biggest stars of

446
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,690
the podcast but you still like us

447
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:25,580
i do have to say there is

448
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:27,470
a funny funny behind the scenes moment

449
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:30,299
that happens learn with you where suddenly

450
00:15:30,299 --> 00:15:32,180
you you stop recording i don't want

451
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:33,770
to spoil it for people but it

452
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:36,080
wasn't it wasn't f f vt xem

453
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,450
it was an epic fail and it

454
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:41,360
was also layer one of the things

455
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,770
that i like about the the first

456
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:44,840
clip is that it was part of

457
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:48,170
god's grand plan for earth yeah well

458
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:49,340
and i think one of the last

459
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:51,650
clips was where you kind of hear

460
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:53,930
us really have a lot of realization

461
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:55,790
about ourselves in each other don't skip

462
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:57,740
ahead laura i'm just saying i'm just

463
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:59,480
saying because i think i think we

464
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,133
are we are planning to do what

465
00:16:01,133 --> 00:16:03,050
did we say podcast mullet where we

466
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:04,520
do a little short beginning and a

467
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,140
longer end so maybe you'll get a

468
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:07,640
little something at the end yeah maybe

469
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:10,250
you want like i like part partway

470
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:11,600
through the show you can hear one

471
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,910
of us sinning yeah yeah

472
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,280
and you'll never guess what it was

473
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,750
yeah yeah here when it happens it's

474
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:19,310
part of god's great plan yeah one

475
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:21,680
of us sins and um i'm not

476
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,590
sure if the person has sought forgiveness

477
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,660
yet for that sin or rate depends

478
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:27,740
on god's plan here's what i love

479
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:30,170
about god's plan is that we don't

480
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,210
have to feel bad when we sin

481
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:33,890
because it's part of the plan

482
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:35,690
and you can do whatever we want

483
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:39,040
well it's it's whatever god wants this

484
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:40,940
what's right is making a sin all

485
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:42,980
the time i like god being a

486
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:44,330
puppet master and i like being a

487
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:48,020

00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:45,600
wow i was misinformed you fiscal year

741
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:46,200
new fiscal

742
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:49,140
animals don't know what year it is

743
00:26:49,170 --> 00:26:50,850
and maybe they're going by a different

744
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:52,470
calendar and a new year could start

745
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:54,840
tomorrow that's right what you never know

746
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:55,980
when a new episode of three-time will

747
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:57,540
show up what animals do you think

748
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:59,190
is closest understanding that it's a new

749
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:00,360
year squirrels

750
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:02,520
i was gonna be parents

751
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:08,460
why because they can think words yeah

752
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:09,870
but they don't they mean i think

753
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:12,240
i think dogs really dogs are able

754
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,650
to figure out the position of the

755
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:16,500
sun so they understand time holiness i

756
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:17,490
mean i don't know what ur talking

757
00:27:17,490 --> 00:27:19,770
about parents just just saying stuff that

758
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:21,390
they i mean i think for the

759
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:22,710
most part they just repeat stuff so

760
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:23,820
like what what

761
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:25,890
do yourself or something what if you

762
00:27:25,892 --> 00:27:27,090
got a parent to say

763
00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:29,850
what if you've got a pair to

764
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:32,916
say i understand years yeah you could

765
00:27:32,935 --> 00:27:34,423
dan then there we go i'm right

766
00:27:34,423 --> 00:27:35,850
here or like i saw a parent

767
00:27:35,850 --> 00:27:37,710
on like dateline who was like looking

768
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:38,550
like you know they'd pull the

769
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:42,630
dateline like a toy and it's just

770
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:48,240
ah he didn't want to crack you

771
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,650
wanted to murder

772
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:54,300
anyway people obviously know those stories were

773
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:56,280
like the parrot knows who killed somebody

774
00:27:57,270 --> 00:27:58,710
but i would train a parent to

775
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:00,810
throw suspicion on somebody else this is

776
00:28:00,810 --> 00:28:03,330
a twin peaks subplot is it oh

777
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:06,090
that's right yeah diversity no um oh

778
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,590
i see ah

779
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:10,980
watch four hundred years and do not

780
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,270
cause like

781
00:28:13,530 --> 00:28:15,450
many hours there's not many hours between

782
00:28:15,451 --> 00:28:16,710
boomers that have you know there's there's

783
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:18,540
problem there that i believe there are

784
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:21,720
about forty six hours plus a movie

785
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:22,830
yeah

786
00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:26,040
not including the return that's included the

787
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:28,050
return but maybe like two episodes per

788
00:28:28,050 --> 00:28:29,490
episode and then an hour and a

789
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:30,900
half of deleted scenes from the movie

790
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:33,540
which are very important anyway alright yeah

791
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:35,938

1109
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:12,880

we're about to hear us in the

1112
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,930
past yeah right now we're in the

1113
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:23,890
future because you're hearing this before after

1114
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,900

we don't know when you're hearing this

1116
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:28,330
so it's the future so it's the

1117
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:30,580
future and honestly it might be the

1118
00:41:30,610 --> 00:41:32,560
future on the old episode to you

1119
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:35,380

1120
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,320
who are talking on the earlier episodes

1121
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:40,240
like there they wouldn't they couldn't even

1122
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:42,760
conceive that this was gonna happen that's

1123
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:43,990
true that's true

1124
00:41:44,050 --> 00:41:45,520

1125
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:47,140
the knowledge that we have now we

1126
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:49,570

function in time to do it we're

1289
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:36,190
in a podcast we're trapped in this

1290
00:47:36,190 --> 00:47:38,770

1291
00:47:38,770 --> 00:47:39,490

1294
00:47:43,990 --> 00:47:45,760
interface is if it keeps me guessing

1295
00:47:45,790 --> 00:47:46,720
like i get used to how a

1296
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:48,010
word yeah and then they change it

1297
00:47:48,010 --> 00:47:50,050
and then i'm like now what i

1298
00:47:50,050 --> 00:47:51,610
think it's fun and exciting like an

1299
00:47:51,610 --> 00:47:53,590
escape room that's true

1300
00:47:54,610 --> 00:47:55,780
you guys are know escape room together

1301
00:47:55,780 --> 00:47:57,850
sometime yeah we should we should decide

1302
00:47:57,853 --> 00:47:59,830
while we do an escape i would

1303
00:47:59,830 --> 00:48:01,120
absolutely do that i think that's really

1304
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:03,910
funny that would be funny so that's

1305
00:48:03,910 --> 00:48:05,140
going to be in the new season

1306
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:08,350
if that'll be a whole ah chunk

1307
00:48:08,350 --> 00:48:10,300
of episodes called threesome escape room

1308
00:48:11,470 --> 00:48:13,420
and that's because that the so that's

1309
00:48:13,420 --> 00:48:15,070
coming up so you don't want to

1310
00:48:15,070 --> 00:48:17,140
miss any of that but until that

1311
00:48:17,140 --> 00:48:20,350
happens we are hearing these threesome classic

1312
00:48:20,350 --> 00:48:23,620
episodes some really interesting episodes where you

1313
00:48:23,620 --> 00:48:25,600

1315
00:48:27,910 --> 00:48:30,250
escape rooms like joshua grow with a

1316
00:48:30,250 --> 00:48:31,570
boom mike capturing every

1317
00:48:31,570 --> 00:48:34,900
anything they say yeah actually i think

1318
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:36,370
we should have lav mikes so that

1319
00:48:36,370 --> 00:48:38,650
when we're like under our breaths cursing

1320
00:48:38,650 --> 00:48:40,930
each other that gets picked yeah because

1321
00:48:40,930 --> 00:48:41,950
i think that's fun for the audience

1322
00:48:41,950 --> 00:48:43,600
and for us to hear later josh

1323
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:46,030
agreed to do that yeah he agreed

1324
00:48:46,845 --> 00:48:50,260
that's this kid is so nuts and

1325
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:51,730
you'll hear that on this episode

1326
00:48:52,262 --> 00:48:53,530
wild

1327
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:56,230
some of these edits he does in

1328
00:48:56,230 --> 00:48:57,760
this episode you're about to hear are

1329
00:48:57,760 --> 00:48:59,260
so crazy i mean yeah does he

1330
00:48:59,290 --> 00:49:01,270
talk on the episode but the idea

1331
00:49:01,270 --> 00:49:03,040
of judging with the boom mike

1332
00:49:04,210 --> 00:49:07,780
like trying to fake out clues some

1333
00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:09,880
doubled its cake and then he's just

1334
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:11,432
trapped in it and he knows he

1335
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:13,060
by the way will be forbidden from

1336
00:49:13,060 --> 00:49:14,320
telling us the answers to any of

1337
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:15,850
these things which he will have figured

1338
00:49:15,850 --> 00:49:17,680
out before us but it's also assure

1339
00:49:17,830 --> 00:49:18,970
like if you're if you're if you

1340
00:49:18,970 --> 00:49:20,020
don't hold a boom mike as your

1341
00:49:20,020 --> 00:49:22,510
job it's a very exhausting thing he's

1342
00:49:22,540 --> 00:49:23,560
he's really excited to do it you

1343
00:49:23,650 --> 00:49:23,890
know

1344
00:49:23,890 --> 00:49:24,970
how much his arms are gonna hurt

1345
00:49:25,180 --> 00:49:27,400
you either way during the between two

1346
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:28,750
ferns movie we did a forty five

1347
00:49:28,750 --> 00:49:30,580
minute take with andy daly and everyone

1348
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:32,080
and i didn't think much of it

1349
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:34,120
but everyone was congratulating the boom mic

1350
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:36,040
operator on how long it was that's

1351
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:38,830
amazing that's right i forgot um that's

1352
00:49:38,830 --> 00:49:40,060
a about hope you said that to

1353
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:41,650
the boom and then he had to

1354
00:49:41,650 --> 00:49:43,840
hold the boom in the movie and

1355
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:44,050
that's

1356
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:46,150
hard to yeah that's very difficult to

1357
00:49:46,150 --> 00:49:48,160
do because suddenly you get camera shy

1358
00:49:48,190 --> 00:49:50,260
and pee shy i bet i could

1359
00:49:50,260 --> 00:49:51,400
do it i bet i'll do it

1360
00:49:51,490 --> 00:49:52,571
i bet i could hold a boom

1361
00:49:52,571 --> 00:49:53,860
and piss at the same time how

1362
00:49:53,860 --> 00:49:55,780
what's the heaviest thing you've ever hold

1363
00:49:55,810 --> 00:49:57,430
held two pencils

1364
00:50:00,550 --> 00:50:02,860
together or any job together or they

1365
00:50:02,860 --> 00:50:05,800
number two yeah so far that's happy

1366
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:08,890
so for pencils wow think for me

1367
00:50:08,890 --> 00:50:10,720
the heaviest thing i ever held is

1368
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:13,390
like marshmallow no

1369
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:17,950

1370
00:50:18,910 --> 00:50:21,520

where i was incredibly amorous relationship i

1376

1378
00:50:37,450 --> 00:50:37,900

yeah yeah you will really find him

1713
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:56,710

process like showed us interview you said

1715
01:02:59,080 --> 01:03:00,370

like joints or yeah yeah we rented

1724
01:03:14,290 --> 01:03:16,990
we rented office two rooms connected at

1725
01:03:16,990 --> 01:03:18,520
least we'd there yeah it was a

1726
01:03:18,520 --> 01:03:20,140

1732
01:03:31,900 --> 01:03:33,580
when we were so high peter showed

1733
01:03:33,580 --> 01:03:34,750
up that's probably why he got hired

1734
01:03:35,770 --> 01:03:38,170
he showed up wearing our minds long

1735
01:03:38,170 --> 01:03:39,850

you say it's it's exciting so my

2098
01:16:50,095 --> 01:16:51,775
idea for a show is really unique

2099
01:16:51,805 --> 01:16:53,425
and the idea is called

2100
01:16:55,645 --> 01:16:59,455
shrinking heels shrinking heels and how's that

2101
01:16:59,455 --> 01:17:03,085
spelled heels hga okay gotta go to

2102
01:17:03,085 --> 01:17:06,145
way okay yea sure cause i'm here

2103
01:17:06,175 --> 01:17:07,885
because i we heard a pitch called

2104
01:17:07,885 --> 01:17:12,055
shrinking heels about high heels yes suddenly

2105
01:17:12,055 --> 01:17:13,495
shrink to where the woman is wearing

2106
01:17:13,495 --> 01:17:14,605
flats yeah

2107
01:17:14,875 --> 01:17:17,305

2108
01:17:17,335 --> 01:17:19,945
oh yeah catholic law shoes yeah exactly

2109
01:17:20,005 --> 01:17:21,745
yeah and then there is the whole

2110
01:17:21,745 --> 01:17:23,635
idea no we were not interested but

2111
01:17:23,635 --> 01:17:25,735
we did buy it yeah okay yeah

2112
01:17:25,765 --> 01:17:27,535
no it's it's not that idea it's

2113
01:17:27,535 --> 01:17:29,215
a totally different one good thing so

2114
01:17:29,215 --> 01:17:31,345
it's called shrinking heels and it's about

2115
01:17:31,345 --> 01:17:34,105
so it's about a family of therapists

2116
01:17:34,945 --> 01:17:36,625
oh i meant that there's a family

2117
01:17:36,925 --> 01:17:40,435
up there a piss um no i

2118
01:17:40,435 --> 01:17:42,235
think you're reading like a jeopardy category

2119
01:17:42,235 --> 01:17:42,835
and snell

2120
01:17:44,065 --> 01:17:46,525
oh no i think we could because

2121
01:17:46,525 --> 01:17:49,165
i just heard it family of thera

2122
01:17:49,615 --> 01:17:51,985
oh okay thank you okay that they

2123
01:17:51,985 --> 01:17:54,295
are crazier than their patients someday are

2124
01:17:54,325 --> 01:17:55,495
they are because oh that's got the

2125
01:17:55,495 --> 01:17:56,695
mom and the dad who are both

2126
01:17:56,695 --> 01:17:59,455
therapists and ensure the kids therapist to

2127
01:17:59,485 --> 01:18:01,855
therapist and training because their own training

2128
01:18:01,855 --> 01:18:02,755
i thought that would just be born

2129
01:18:02,755 --> 01:18:04,195
therapy or i'm a dad whoopee

2130
01:18:04,195 --> 01:18:05,515
a i t i thought you were

2131
01:18:05,545 --> 01:18:08,035
grandfathered into something like that wait t

2132
01:18:08,035 --> 01:18:09,235
i t what did you say the

2133
01:18:09,235 --> 01:18:10,825
kids are th by the way put

2134
01:18:10,825 --> 01:18:13,231
those away when you say that just

2135
01:18:13,273 --> 01:18:15,145
to make it clear the kids are

2136
01:18:15,205 --> 01:18:19,255
kids therapist in training's got two of

2137
01:18:19,255 --> 01:18:21,655
them and they're big and bouncy and

2138
01:18:21,715 --> 01:18:22,105
yeah

2139
01:18:24,325 --> 01:18:27,175
exactly they bounce around like gummy bears

2140
01:18:27,205 --> 01:18:28,375
i'm one of them is slightly bigger

2141
01:18:28,375 --> 01:18:31,615
than the others that one's older so

2142
01:18:33,265 --> 01:18:35,455
the kids are really astute they're really

2143
01:18:35,455 --> 01:18:38,005
observant um and they're great therapists and

2144
01:18:38,125 --> 01:18:39,775
now you've got get a dictionary hold

2145
01:18:39,775 --> 01:18:42,115
on stewed the way you smell that

2146
01:18:42,145 --> 01:18:45,115
dog ceo yellow t

2147
01:18:46,735 --> 01:18:48,295
that's right that's correct

2148
01:18:49,255 --> 01:18:51,505
all ideas i opened up the dictionary

2149
01:18:51,575 --> 01:18:52,495

2150
01:19:00,985 --> 01:19:03,805
that's okay family therapists and then want

2151
01:19:03,835 --> 01:19:06,625
to get buddy okay so even the

2152
01:19:06,655 --> 01:19:08,155
funny thing is though here's what goes

2153
01:19:08,155 --> 01:19:10,075
on go funny it's the dog it

2154
01:19:10,075 --> 01:19:11,755

2155
01:19:11,785 --> 01:19:12,355
taio

2156
01:19:13,405 --> 01:19:17,215
yeah they're animals what is this whoa

2157
01:19:17,515 --> 01:19:20,065
i've never heard anything like this no

2158
01:19:20,125 --> 01:19:20,832
and so

2159
01:19:22,435 --> 01:19:25,255
and is it a totally silent no

2160
01:19:25,285 --> 01:19:28,345
no dialogue no music good question i

2161
01:19:28,345 --> 01:19:30,955
had the same it's an animated show

2162
01:19:31,285 --> 01:19:34,645
where no one talks no one sings

2163
01:19:34,675 --> 01:19:37,015
there's no music there's no sound there

2164
01:19:37,015 --> 01:19:38,785
is that um sort of beep that

2165
01:19:38,785 --> 01:19:40,255
happens when they're doing like a test

2166
01:19:40,255 --> 01:19:41,875
on tv okay

2167
01:19:42,115 --> 01:19:44,275
right right here all throughout or just

2168
01:19:44,305 --> 01:19:46,705
intermittently um intermittently just make sure you're

2169
01:19:46,765 --> 01:19:48,445
you're still paying attention it's kind of

2170
01:19:48,445 --> 01:19:50,035
like the netflix are you still watching

2171
01:19:50,065 --> 01:19:52,765
thing it's like it goes and it

2172
01:19:52,765 --> 01:19:54,265
sort of just asking you if you're

2173
01:19:54,265 --> 01:19:55,945
paying attention and if there's an emergency

2174
01:19:55,945 --> 01:19:57,775
this what would happen that kind of

2175
01:19:57,775 --> 01:20:00,565
thing does do the full emergency broadcast

2176
01:20:00,565 --> 01:20:01,885
system instructions

2177
01:20:02,545 --> 01:20:04,405
over that over the animation i got

2178
01:20:04,405 --> 01:20:07,465
the rights to those already yeah rights

2179
01:20:07,495 --> 01:20:09,385
and so is that incorporated into the

2180
01:20:09,385 --> 01:20:10,915
theme song because i would imagine that's

2181
01:20:10,915 --> 01:20:12,205
the only other time you hear some

2182
01:20:12,205 --> 01:20:14,365

2183
01:20:15,685 --> 01:20:19,615
