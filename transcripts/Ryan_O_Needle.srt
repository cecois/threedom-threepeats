had and he it was such a

51
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:27,900
good idea and we're full of ideas

the best way to get a full

93
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:50,010
night's sleep is to close your eyes

94
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:51,360
and not wake up the whole time

95
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,760

so i was like that's weird that

172
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:43,230

we're so fine as ryan o'neal do

469
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:15,710
you remember that movie yes they do

470
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:17,780
with the it was about a guy

471
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:19,460
who i never was allowed to see

472
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:21,110
it but i saw the the trailer

473
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:22,460
for and it was about isaak

474
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:24,860
z who who invented genes that had

475
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:28,640
clear plastic butt cheeks yes what what

476
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,190
happened was here's here's all i think

477
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:32,683
so you fart and they fill with

478
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:33,080
care

479
00:17:33,805 --> 00:17:35,390
so the first thing you think of

480
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:40,310
do your regular pets leave a fog

481
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:43,850
up fog huh it would be like

482
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:46,670
obvious here's what i have thought this

483
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:48,290
isn't this is really weird as a

484
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:50,360
kid i always thought i wish farts

485
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,770
were colors so that you could tell

486
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:55,790
sure but and everyone had the students

487
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:57,920
color and it's really better that's not

488
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:58,490
a thing

489
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,950
for what i remember i don't think

490
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:05,960
i ever saw the full movie but

491
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,520
i believe what happens is the way

492
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,370
he accidentally invents these genes is that

493
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:12,560
he is sleeping makes the scenes interaction

494
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:14,510
and yeah not only his girlfriend jeans

495
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:16,430
no he's sleeping with this woman that

496
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:18,020
he's not supposed to be sleeping with

497
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:19,820
and then her husband comes home

498
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:21,020
home or whatever and he has to

499
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:22,370
get out of the house he puts

500
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:25,010
on her jeans and they split in

501
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:26,150
the back and for i don't know

502
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:29,480
i figured out how laughable idea yeah

503
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:34,430
and then somebody complimented sheets being able

504
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:36,020

617
00:22:41,435 --> 00:22:43,895

619
00:22:45,185 --> 00:22:46,505
they left in this thing where she

620
00:22:46,745 --> 00:22:47,795
they were added a kind of they

621
00:22:47,795 --> 00:22:49,205
were like a speech that this woman

622
00:22:49,205 --> 00:22:51,215
was giving about bullying and it was

623
00:22:51,215 --> 00:22:52,985
one of the housewives

624
00:22:54,035 --> 00:22:56,465
children like stepchildren what were they pro

625
00:22:56,465 --> 00:23:00,215
or con again they were and she

626
00:23:00,215 --> 00:23:04,265
had um like a ah a tumor

627
00:23:04,265 --> 00:23:06,845
in her lip this this woman and

628
00:23:06,845 --> 00:23:08,465
so no i'm sorry

629
00:23:11,975 --> 00:23:13,775
and ramona goes after the show she's

630
00:23:13,775 --> 00:23:15,875
like after the speech she's like that

631
00:23:15,875 --> 00:23:18,425
was so amazing situ she she's just

632
00:23:18,425 --> 00:23:20,225
so confident and you think just stop

633
00:23:20,231 --> 00:23:21,959
talking just you're good like just stop

634
00:23:22,325 --> 00:23:23,735
and she's like and then you didn't

635
00:23:23,945 --> 00:23:27,755
she's deformed he's like you just set

636
00:23:28,035 --> 00:23:29,795
the show and now that

637
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:31,505
woman has to see that and then

638
00:23:31,505 --> 00:23:32,825
i'm like i think it's actually a

639
00:23:32,825 --> 00:23:34,385
problem they left it in because it's

640
00:23:34,385 --> 00:23:36,785
just like now what everyone's hurt by

641
00:23:36,785 --> 00:23:38,525
this when this was just something rude

642
00:23:38,525 --> 00:23:40,415
that she said in the backroom but

643
00:23:40,415 --> 00:23:42,005
i mean if they were thinking about

644
00:23:42,155 --> 00:23:44,435
how this affects us as a society

645
00:23:44,585 --> 00:23:45,575
it wouldn't be a show

646
00:23:47,255 --> 00:23:49,624
they would choose better idea to raise

647
00:23:49,624 --> 00:23:52,505
their samurai killer person who was offend

648
00:23:52,541 --> 00:23:55,475
yeah assaulted by whatever other housewives it's

649
00:23:55,475 --> 00:23:57,965
absolutely terrible you like a better lauren

650
00:23:57,965 --> 00:23:59,735
when they're just insulting each other like

651
00:23:59,735 --> 00:24:01,025
they all signed because they all signed

652
00:24:01,025 --> 00:24:02,705
up i'm saying that person was just

653
00:24:02,705 --> 00:24:04,175
doing a speech like right they all

654
00:24:04,175 --> 00:24:05,225
went to the sign-up sheet

655
00:24:06,305 --> 00:24:08,075
in between classes just kind of yeah

656
00:24:08,135 --> 00:24:10,055
she got into the bulletin board to

657
00:24:10,055 --> 00:24:11,885
see who got to be a housewife

658
00:24:12,995 --> 00:24:14,525
now they're there the way they do

659
00:24:14,525 --> 00:24:17,945
those shows do they do they have

660
00:24:17,945 --> 00:24:20,555
a sort of way of auditioning people

661
00:24:20,555 --> 00:24:22,685
to see if they're going to work

662
00:24:22,685 --> 00:24:24,635
out on the show well because a

663
00:24:24,635 --> 00:24:26,195
lot of times the people don't really

664
00:24:26,195 --> 00:24:27,245
know each other that well but they

665
00:24:27,245 --> 00:24:29,075
kind of imply that they're all friends

666
00:24:29,075 --> 00:24:30,545
but they're not really so it's like

667
00:24:30,545 --> 00:24:32,105
they find somewhere all in the same

668
00:24:32,165 --> 00:24:33,155
circles

669
00:24:33,185 --> 00:24:34,745
or something and they're like oh yeah

670
00:24:34,745 --> 00:24:36,335
yeah hearing about her for a while

671
00:24:37,505 --> 00:24:38,315
but i wish i was on that

672
00:24:38,315 --> 00:24:39,905
show sometimes i like watching i'm like

673
00:24:40,265 --> 00:24:40,985
i would like to be on the

674
00:24:40,985 --> 00:24:41,975
show i don't really want to be

675
00:24:41,975 --> 00:24:42,635
in it but i would like to

676
00:24:42,635 --> 00:24:45,305
be there go your a fucking bitch

677
00:24:45,335 --> 00:24:47,345
like no one says it like they

678
00:24:47,345 --> 00:24:48,515
scream at each other at a certain

679
00:24:48,515 --> 00:24:49,685
point but think they needed to be

680
00:24:49,685 --> 00:24:50,705
doing it like nipping it in the

681
00:24:50,735 --> 00:24:51,905
bud like a little earlier like oh

682
00:24:51,905 --> 00:24:53,135
my god it's the busiest i could

683
00:24:53,135 --> 00:24:55,505
just like like shutting them down immediately

684
00:24:55,535 --> 00:24:57,275
yeah stop talking

685
00:24:58,205 --> 00:25:00,335
right my one of my favorite things

686
00:25:00,335 --> 00:25:01,685
about because you know i only watch

687
00:25:01,685 --> 00:25:04,625
one reality show which is southern charm

688
00:25:04,835 --> 00:25:06,545
is is paul's reality recap this is

689
00:25:06,545 --> 00:25:10,295
paul's rot rodriquez carry out yeah yeah

690
00:25:11,135 --> 00:25:14,495
um and it's it's terrible terrible shows

691
00:25:14,495 --> 00:25:17,465
boring yeah that one is boring people

692
00:25:17,465 --> 00:25:17,795
are bored

693
00:25:17,795 --> 00:25:19,865
earring and but what i love is

694
00:25:20,315 --> 00:25:22,865
the the reality show trope of sonos

695
00:25:22,872 --> 00:25:24,875
having a party and then it's the

696
00:25:24,875 --> 00:25:26,735
only people at the party are them

697
00:25:26,825 --> 00:25:29,015
right yeah it's the same it's the

698
00:25:29,015 --> 00:25:31,175
same sweet people every time i think

699
00:25:31,175 --> 00:25:32,285
like that i'm real housewives like they

700
00:25:32,285 --> 00:25:33,935
have like an event and it's like

701
00:25:34,115 --> 00:25:35,195
there are other people there who are

702
00:25:35,195 --> 00:25:37,955
just filler yeah and but the producers

703
00:25:37,985 --> 00:25:40,475
or have staged it essentially yeah and

704
00:25:40,475 --> 00:25:41,705
the only reason the event is happening

705
00:25:41,735 --> 00:25:43,385
so they can scream somewhere where it

706
00:25:43,385 --> 00:25:45,275
seems inappropriate because they they all have

707
00:25:45,275 --> 00:25:46,955

708
00:25:46,955 --> 00:25:48,965

00:26:53,165 --> 00:26:55,115
was pissed what else show i thought

740
00:26:55,115 --> 00:26:58,115
it was a fairytale ending you know

741
00:26:58,145 --> 00:27:01,865
i kind of called it early utah

742
00:27:01,895 --> 00:27:03,875
tell you rock the block is a

743
00:27:03,875 --> 00:27:05,555
show you can watch it on discovery

744
00:27:05,555 --> 00:27:06,965
plus app which i'm always talking about

745
00:27:07,175 --> 00:27:07,955
but you can also watch it on

746
00:27:07,955 --> 00:27:09,845
hgtv won't do and

747
00:27:09,905 --> 00:27:12,905
okay and the show is that's like

748
00:27:13,008 --> 00:27:14,765
these payments they get for teams of

749
00:27:14,765 --> 00:27:18,185
famous designers for two and four identical

750
00:27:18,185 --> 00:27:20,465
houses on one street and they make

751
00:27:20,465 --> 00:27:22,115
they make like they say go crazy

752
00:27:22,175 --> 00:27:24,965
scott waited until laura was just about

753
00:27:24,965 --> 00:27:27,305
to start i can't handle where i

754
00:27:27,305 --> 00:27:28,985
go i was gonna see it as

755
00:27:29,075 --> 00:27:30,035
simply as that

756
00:27:30,574 --> 00:27:32,525
and you weren't yes i was and

757
00:27:32,525 --> 00:27:34,625
so the first season was the only

758
00:27:34,625 --> 00:27:35,550
way i would have veered off for

759
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:37,083
that is it the first season it's

760
00:27:37,083 --> 00:27:39,244
just solo people who are the host

761
00:27:39,244 --> 00:27:41,885
of different hgtv shows the next season

762
00:27:41,885 --> 00:27:44,315
they have a partner and that's what's

763
00:27:44,315 --> 00:27:46,595
going to happen the next season suddenly

764
00:27:46,625 --> 00:27:48,185
for people to have kim

765
00:27:49,565 --> 00:27:50,975
if they'd have just like three minutes

766
00:27:51,125 --> 00:27:52,745
late once for like one of the

767
00:27:52,745 --> 00:27:54,125
rooms but so they take these houses

768
00:27:54,125 --> 00:27:55,775
that are identical and then they are

769
00:27:55,775 --> 00:27:57,455
given challenges like this gets the kitchen

770
00:27:57,455 --> 00:27:58,265
and then they have to do the

771
00:27:58,265 --> 00:27:59,585
kitchen and you can change whatever you

772
00:27:59,585 --> 00:28:00,755
want did want you have a budget

773
00:28:00,755 --> 00:28:01,985
of like two hundred thousand dollars or

774
00:28:01,985 --> 00:28:03,965
whatever and then for the whole house

775
00:28:04,595 --> 00:28:06,365
and then at the end there's a

776
00:28:06,365 --> 00:28:08,885
winner and they they tell you

777
00:28:08,945 --> 00:28:10,655
who wins based on which house is

778
00:28:10,655 --> 00:28:12,245
now a praise for the most money

779
00:28:12,845 --> 00:28:15,605
but the show is kind of confusing

780
00:28:15,605 --> 00:28:17,075
because what i love about it is

781
00:28:17,075 --> 00:28:19,235
that it's almost right used the design

782
00:28:19,235 --> 00:28:21,335
element is the most fun part because

783
00:28:21,335 --> 00:28:23,195
they get really creative they make the

784
00:28:23,195 --> 00:28:25,895
spaces really beautiful and then at the

785
00:28:25,895 --> 00:28:27,365
end it's based on what what you

786
00:28:27,365 --> 00:28:28,745
can sell it for which they don't

787
00:28:28,745 --> 00:28:29,045
go

788
00:28:29,075 --> 00:28:30,935
well this stuff actually detracts from the

789
00:28:30,935 --> 00:28:32,855
sale because it started and that's what

790
00:28:32,855 --> 00:28:34,115
i find so interesting about it because

791
00:28:34,115 --> 00:28:35,525
the whole time when the the team

792
00:28:35,525 --> 00:28:37,415
that won wasn't winning any challenges i'm

793
00:28:37,415 --> 00:28:39,395
like well they should win because they

794
00:28:39,845 --> 00:28:41,765
they upgraded this house in a more

795
00:28:41,765 --> 00:28:43,865
premiere away i felt that it was

796
00:28:43,895 --> 00:28:46,295
the most the least inspiring of them

797
00:28:46,295 --> 00:28:49,145
all which i just like nate

798
00:28:49,385 --> 00:28:52,205
literally judges said nate and jeremiah gave

799
00:28:52,205 --> 00:28:53,975
the house a soul and then they

800
00:28:53,975 --> 00:28:55,715
go and the winner is this person

801
00:28:56,555 --> 00:28:59,555
and that concludes reality right here he

802
00:28:59,585 --> 00:29:02,075
cap yeah it's only if i mean

803
00:29:02,075 --> 00:29:03,965
it's only one reality recap and a

804
00:29:03,965 --> 00:29:06,215
yeah ok you may

805
00:29:07,535 --> 00:29:10,865
go ahead recap yeah yeah you're right

806
00:29:10,895 --> 00:29:12,185
we should just put the drop in

807
00:29:12,815 --> 00:29:14,465
i guess we should i don't know

808
00:29:14,465 --> 00:29:16,025
i don't think we should yeah i

809
00:29:16,025 --> 00:29:16,957
don't know really i don't want i

810
00:29:16,957 --> 00:29:18,275
don't want it's gonna come out and

811
00:29:18,275 --> 00:29:19,805
drop and you're all jealous we shouldn't

812
00:29:19,805 --> 00:29:20,615
put it in here we should put

813
00:29:20,615 --> 00:29:21,815
it in someplace else where it doesn't

814
00:29:21,815 --> 00:29:23,456
belong yeah for fun i don't want

815
00:29:23,465 --> 00:29:25,235
a peer pressure josh into playing this

816
00:29:25,235 --> 00:29:27,305
drop that we've mentioned twenty five

817
00:29:27,395 --> 00:29:28,775
times let's not make jaw

818
00:29:29,825 --> 00:29:33,725
ah to be fair josh's erring on

819
00:29:33,725 --> 00:29:35,375
the side of caution yeah because he

820
00:29:35,397 --> 00:29:37,595
knows if he did that we would

821
00:29:37,595 --> 00:29:39,305
have roasted him even though it's entirely

822
00:29:39,305 --> 00:29:42,065
appropriate handler in you can't win josh

823
00:29:42,095 --> 00:29:42,935
knows that he can't win

824
00:29:44,375 --> 00:29:45,845
so he decides to not even play

825
00:29:45,845 --> 00:29:48,695
the game exactly is reality we kept

826
00:29:48,695 --> 00:29:49,445
that boring

827
00:29:50,735 --> 00:29:53,105
ah right right to us right to

828
00:29:53,105 --> 00:29:54,665

829
00:29:56,015 --> 00:29:58,295

nickelodeon where there was this little popsicle

839
00:30:19,115 --> 00:30:21,065
stick named stick stickley and he would

840
00:30:21,065 --> 00:30:22,895
be sort of a spokesperson for the

841
00:30:22,895 --> 00:30:26,525

dies on stage audience doesn't get it

960

gonna dig in my headline

961
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:49,560
and but physically dexterous unpredictable this this

962
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:50,970
comedian fell to the floor during a

963
00:34:50,970 --> 00:34:52,710
solo performance in san diego and never

964
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:53,850
got up well okay so he was

965
00:34:53,850 --> 00:34:55,920
always doing physical unpredictable bits i guess

966
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,210
that makes sense at the age of

967
00:34:57,210 --> 00:34:58,380
sixty three he had died on the

968
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:00,630
job but shannon was sometimes so outrageous

969
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:01,860
on stage that more than five minutes

970
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:03,690
passed before anyone dared to check if

971
00:35:03,690 --> 00:35:05,790
he was still breathing that's like if

972
00:35:05,790 --> 00:35:06,150
you were

973
00:35:06,150 --> 00:35:08,460
or a juggler who juggled dangerous things

974
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:09,810
like chain saws and you had a

975
00:35:09,810 --> 00:35:12,420
fake bit where like you cut off

976
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:14,610
your fake arm with one of them

977
00:35:14,610 --> 00:35:15,930
you know like would anyone be able

978
00:35:15,930 --> 00:35:18,120
to ever trust it if you actually

979
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:18,570
did it

980
00:35:19,830 --> 00:35:21,360
what you've done here is well built

981
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:23,820
in thing near their act when they're

982
00:35:23,850 --> 00:35:25,260

983
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:26,550

00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:29,220
magic castle ones and in one of

985
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:30,810

986
00:35:30,810 --> 00:35:34,020
room yeah there was this guy who

987
00:35:34,050 --> 00:35:35,970
you know how magicians fake fuck up

988
00:35:35,970 --> 00:35:37,500
their act a lot so that they

989
00:35:37,523 --> 00:35:39,420
they can go yes yes oh my

990
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:39,750

and then kind of feel sad right

995
00:35:47,310 --> 00:35:49,440

996
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,990

997
00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:54,210

00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:46,650
so it's like you watch these things

1110
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:48,300
and forget them the second that you

1111
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:49,980

1112
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:52,260

1117
00:39:58,140 --> 00:39:59,700
he's not in the movie it's trailer

1118
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:01,110
it's a clip yeah it didn't not

1119
00:40:01,110 --> 00:40:02,640
seem like a trailer it just seemed

1120
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,260
like it seemed like a commercial for

1121
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:06,360
actual marshmallows to be on like i

1122
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:07,560

and i liked the whole thing i

1124
00:40:09,630 --> 00:40:11,010

that was not funny at all it

1175
00:42:02,570 --> 00:42:04,340
was treating the ghostbusters like it was

1176
00:42:04,490 --> 00:42:06,500
like it was a horror movie right

1177
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:07,010
really

1178
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:09,488

1179
00:42:09,578 --> 00:42:11,690
ghostbusters is a horror movie no it's

1180
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:13,220

1181
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:15,410

1185
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:26,630
but i was when i saw ghostbusters

1186
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:28,490
i was a kid but i was

1187
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:30,380
old enough that it was not actually

1188
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:32,090
scary to me there i will say

1189
00:42:32,090 --> 00:42:35,150
the library scene at the beginning made

1190
00:42:35,150 --> 00:42:37,790
us all go huh well the games

1191
00:42:37,790 --> 00:42:40,760
get a jump scare when this show

1192
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:43,310
on um netflix that's like around

1193
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:46,670
quality recasting reality recap it's not reality

1194
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:47,428
i mean i guess it is but

1195
00:42:47,428 --> 00:42:48,740
it's behind the scenes of your favorite

1196
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:50,600
classic films and how they were made

1197
00:42:51,290 --> 00:42:53,300
and with cameras i've ghost busters is

1198
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:54,290
one of them they showed how they

1199
00:42:54,290 --> 00:42:56,840
did that trick with the library and

1200
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:59,210
it was really um strings that does

1201
00:42:59,210 --> 00:42:59,960
remind me of

1202
00:43:03,560 --> 00:43:06,170
it does remind me of a sketch

1203
00:43:06,170 --> 00:43:07,730
i wrote for mister show that bob

1204
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:10,790
turned down immediately which was it was

1205
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:13,610
the sports illustrated behind the making of

1206
00:43:13,610 --> 00:43:18,350
the sports illustrated swimsuit issue and then

1207
00:43:18,410 --> 00:43:20,270
it was a really dry documentary about

1208
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:21,230
um cut

1209
00:43:21,230 --> 00:43:22,580
cutting down the trees and making the

1210
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:25,700
paper and the printing presses and running

1211
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:27,830
and he was like oh yeah i

1212
00:43:27,830 --> 00:43:29,600
get it words have different meanings

1213
00:43:32,450 --> 00:43:33,530
and we never spoke of it ever

1214
00:43:33,530 --> 00:43:35,570
again ah you should bring it up

1215
00:43:35,570 --> 00:43:37,100

going on at length ah all the

1221
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:51,410
things that were wrong with it and

1222
00:43:51,410 --> 00:43:52,790
why he didn't like it and they

1223
00:43:52,790 --> 00:43:55,880
concluded by saying um so in conclusion

1224
00:43:56,180 --> 00:43:57,860
i hate this sketch and it's trying

1225
00:43:57,860 --> 00:43:58,370
to kill me

1226
00:43:58,460 --> 00:43:59,540
they dropped it on the floor

1227
00:44:00,710 --> 00:44:01,310

00:44:09,410 --> 00:44:11,450
get so mad about something like i

1231
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:13,010
one time i said it with a

1232
00:44:13,010 --> 00:44:14,570
chuckle but i remember how fun it

1233
00:44:14,570 --> 00:44:16,220
was when my face got so hot

1234
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:21,350

you would shoot especially this is how

1238
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:27,350
he went he would put on his

1239
00:44:27,530 --> 00:44:29,183
jeans with the plastic butt cheeks

1240
00:44:30,411 --> 00:44:33,170

00:44:39,890 --> 00:44:42,320
or grammar or punctuation error i would

1244
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:43,730
make them go back and rewrite it

1245
00:44:44,150 --> 00:44:46,580
um just for fun to like you

1246
00:44:46,580 --> 00:44:48,800
know but during the read through tim

1247
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:50,270
cal packs would be like it

1248
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:52,130
would be version six we would always

1249
00:44:52,130 --> 00:44:53,540
read the title and what version it

1250
00:44:53,540 --> 00:44:55,160
was and go version six and we

1251
00:44:55,165 --> 00:44:57,050
go this is the last one this

1252
00:44:57,050 --> 00:45:00,230

we'd be reading i go hey hand

1254
00:45:01,850 --> 00:45:06,320
me you are pair of scissors and

1255
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:07,820
he would go dammit and sit and

1256
00:45:07,820 --> 00:45:10,190
like crumple it up and like go

1257
00:45:10,190 --> 00:45:10,430
back to

1258
00:45:10,467 --> 00:45:11,660
the drawing board to do a version

1259
00:45:11,690 --> 00:45:13,430

1260
00:45:13,430 --> 00:45:15,260
to think a really good time it

1261
00:45:15,260 --> 00:45:17,180
would disrupt the day though and then

1262
00:45:17,570 --> 00:45:19,220
well i would dock their pay for

1263
00:45:19,220 --> 00:45:22,400
all their docs them i would talk

1264
00:45:22,610 --> 00:45:24,590
i would feel docs reveal the docs

1265
00:45:24,590 --> 00:45:26,990
their pay addresses on the internet for

1266
00:45:26,990 --> 00:45:29,780

00:45:29,780 --> 00:45:30,590
we would have drawing comm

1268
00:45:30,620 --> 00:45:32,330
petitions that was fun where we would

1269
00:45:32,330 --> 00:45:35,780
like we would make neil campbell boats

1270
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:37,490
and then we would all take ten

1271
00:45:37,490 --> 00:45:38,330
minutes to drive

1272
00:45:40,340 --> 00:45:44,720

do

1301
00:46:47,090 --> 00:46:49,550
do chip clips work is my question

1302
00:46:49,550 --> 00:46:51,860
because are the tipping point whatever the

1303
00:46:51,860 --> 00:46:54,380
chip i got it lawrence they fricking

1304
00:46:54,530 --> 00:46:57,590
stale food no but that but but

1305
00:46:57,950 --> 00:46:59,930
chips if if you're trying to protect

1306
00:46:59,930 --> 00:47:02,300
them from air and all a chip

1307
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:04,700
clip does is like crumple up the

1308
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:05,900
bag in one part of it it's

1309
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:06,350
not see

1310
00:47:06,350 --> 00:47:08,150
peeling it off completely so shouldn't you

1311
00:47:08,150 --> 00:47:09,560
if you're really concerned about your chips

1312
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:10,640
when you put them into like an

1313
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:13,550
airtight container like tupperware thing here's what

1314
00:47:13,550 --> 00:47:15,110
you do okay

1315
00:47:16,220 --> 00:47:17,180
can't believe have to walk you through

1316
00:47:17,180 --> 00:47:20,030
the checkout you can vote you fault

1317
00:47:21,290 --> 00:47:23,930
you fold the bag over i you

1318
00:47:23,990 --> 00:47:26,000
know press l or an over there

1319
00:47:26,060 --> 00:47:28,490
over i know i hand over i

1320
00:47:28,490 --> 00:47:31,340
know but i'm saying it's not airtight

1321
00:47:31,850 --> 00:47:33,830
and not like yeah out of everyone

1322
00:47:33,830 --> 00:47:35,480
deal yeah but it's casual with you

1323
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:37,490
just kinda crumpled and you you clamp

1324
00:47:37,490 --> 00:47:39,320
the little thing on a club it's

1325
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:40,760
a crumbling claim but here's the thing

1326
00:47:40,790 --> 00:47:41,390
that being said

1327
00:47:41,510 --> 00:47:43,250
i put those cadbury mini eggs in

1328
00:47:43,250 --> 00:47:45,590
an airtight jar and they are stale

1329
00:47:45,590 --> 00:47:47,750
and i they came that way the

1330
00:47:47,750 --> 00:47:49,400
end but there you go so that

1331
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:51,350
dude that debunk your theory they didn't

1332
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:54,080
steal them and disable them so you're

1333
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:55,760
talking out of your ass but the

1334
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:57,019
thing is you don't need them to

1335
00:47:57,019 --> 00:47:58,280
be vacuum seal because you're not gonna

1336
00:47:58,280 --> 00:48:00,320
keep these chips forever it's just you're

1337
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:01,460
gonna work damn and within

1338
00:48:01,842 --> 00:48:03,620
so what is then the life i

1339
00:48:03,620 --> 00:48:05,660
want anyone who knows about chip clip

1340
00:48:05,660 --> 00:48:07,730
technology to write to us i o

1341
00:48:07,790 --> 00:48:10,280
does it if cn doesn't extend the

1342
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:12,860
period and by how long and would

1343
00:48:12,860 --> 00:48:14,300
it be longer if they were in

1344
00:48:14,330 --> 00:48:16,670
a an airtight container yes well it's

1345
00:48:16,670 --> 00:48:19,700
like it doesn't extend the menzies by

1346
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:21,710
the way someone has written to

1347
00:48:21,740 --> 00:48:23,960
us to say menzies is a medical

1348
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:26,268
term and many people huh you wait

1349
00:48:26,270 --> 00:48:27,800
and somebody else was like whoa lord

1350
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:30,050
knows i know what the fuck menzies

1351
00:48:30,050 --> 00:48:33,110
is get off my dick dick and

1352
00:48:33,110 --> 00:48:34,730
they thought now they the people were

1353
00:48:34,730 --> 00:48:36,260
under the impression that scott thought it

1354
00:48:36,260 --> 00:48:38,990
was a cute nickname for the menstruation

1355
00:48:38,990 --> 00:48:40,640
cycle now that but that's true that's

1356
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:41,750
how i heard it

1357
00:48:42,110 --> 00:48:43,670
i think you thought it was oh

1358
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:44,900
well then i guess you're correcting me

1359
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:45,890
but i thought you thought it was

1360
00:48:45,890 --> 00:48:48,500
just funny because it was so proper

1361
00:48:48,530 --> 00:48:50,240
and not like no not that it

1362
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:51,710
was proper i've just i've always heard

1363
00:48:51,710 --> 00:48:53,150
it in the in the term of

1364
00:48:53,150 --> 00:48:55,130
like mothers saying to their kid like

1365
00:48:55,130 --> 00:48:57,110
hey oh you got your menzies like

1366
00:48:57,260 --> 00:48:59,420
trying to make a cuter than it

1367
00:48:59,420 --> 00:49:01,220
was but people are so there's nothing

1368
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:02,000
cute about the

1369
00:49:02,060 --> 00:49:04,070
it's about no nancy's it's a gross

1370
00:49:04,070 --> 00:49:05,450
word for a gross thing

1371
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:08,450
we should never talk about it honestly

1372
00:49:09,170 --> 00:49:10,880
there'll be a mencius i feel like

1373
00:49:10,940 --> 00:49:13,070
it feels archaic that's why it's funny

1374
00:49:13,070 --> 00:49:15,860
to me like it feels like i

1375
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:17,260
feel like it was like very like

1376
00:49:17,260 --> 00:49:17,900
it was a lot to say to

1377
00:49:17,900 --> 00:49:20,180
you on the phone like when she

1378
00:49:20,180 --> 00:49:23,450
gets her menzies it's like she's sure

1379
00:49:23,630 --> 00:49:26,270
she gets to me she's i thought

1380
00:49:26,270 --> 00:49:26,750
it should be

1381
00:49:26,750 --> 00:49:29,090
ie when she starts demonstrate like just

1382
00:49:29,090 --> 00:49:30,680
say it the way it is but

1383
00:49:30,710 --> 00:49:32,360
but apparently it is a medical term

1384
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:35,900
and so hey hey everyone i shouldn't

1385
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:37,520

in terms of video games um but

1399
00:50:14,030 --> 00:50:14,450
in terms of

1400
00:50:14,510 --> 00:50:17,450
board games like board games we played

1401
00:50:17,450 --> 00:50:18,440
a lot of board games so we

1402
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:20,030
had we had a lot that were

1403
00:50:20,060 --> 00:50:22,190
just fun to set up like hotels

1404
00:50:22,340 --> 00:50:23,780
that game was always fun just looks

1405
00:50:23,780 --> 00:50:25,070
really i don't know hotels i don't

1406
00:50:25,070 --> 00:50:28,010
know oh hotels is just monopoly but

1407
00:50:28,610 --> 00:50:29,870
probably i don't think ever more so

1408
00:50:29,870 --> 00:50:32,390
it was happening and then i played

1409
00:50:32,390 --> 00:50:33,740
monopoly monopoly all the time but i

1410
00:50:33,740 --> 00:50:34,670
didn't understand what was

1411
00:50:34,670 --> 00:50:37,220
is happening there either and i had

1412
00:50:37,220 --> 00:50:39,140
a game called ready set spaghetti that

1413
00:50:39,140 --> 00:50:42,350
i enjoyed what and i just felt

1414
00:50:42,350 --> 00:50:44,210
like cooking you know what i really

1415
00:50:44,210 --> 00:50:46,790
liked that thing that's like it was

1416
00:50:46,790 --> 00:50:49,070
like a conveyor belt you just put

1417
00:50:49,070 --> 00:50:50,300
penguins on and they go up the

1418
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:52,730
stairs oh yeah thing is going much

1419
00:50:53,030 --> 00:50:54,380
the thing is great that's always your

1420
00:50:54,380 --> 00:50:54,830
favorite board

1421
00:50:56,370 --> 00:50:57,870
i was not a big fan of

1422
00:50:57,900 --> 00:51:02,040
board games i liked i liked sorry

1423
00:51:02,070 --> 00:51:04,470
i liked ah so i remember liking

1424
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:08,010
clue um close felt like it was

1425
00:51:08,010 --> 00:51:09,510
like you you got to really commit

1426
00:51:09,750 --> 00:51:11,490
and you gotta like yes play it

1427
00:51:11,490 --> 00:51:13,800
all the way through and three but

1428
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:15,660
that's monopoly too it's always

1429
00:51:15,903 --> 00:51:17,130
give up monopoly in the middle of

1430
00:51:17,130 --> 00:51:18,540
it clues almost a weird game for

1431
00:51:18,540 --> 00:51:21,120
kids to play like it i wonder

1432
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:22,350
if as an adult it would be

1433
00:51:22,350 --> 00:51:25,140
more enjoyable to play i thought it

1434
00:51:25,140 --> 00:51:27,900
was really fun because not not i

1435
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:29,130
didn't think it was dark or anything

1436
00:51:29,130 --> 00:51:30,090
like that but it was just like

1437
00:51:30,090 --> 00:51:33,030
process of elimination like figuring out too

1438
00:51:33,030 --> 00:51:35,610
much like schools yeah it's like ordering

1439
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:35,820
all

1440
00:51:35,820 --> 00:51:38,130
all board games are school's job you

1441
00:51:38,130 --> 00:51:39,570
know what i like don't say that

1442
00:51:40,230 --> 00:51:41,790
hungry hungry hippos

1443
00:51:43,350 --> 00:51:44,820
that's ah was that was a little

1444
00:51:44,820 --> 00:51:46,440
after my time when i was a

1445
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:47,460

00:51:57,930 --> 00:52:00,570
game issue and create like a rink

1453
00:52:00,570 --> 00:52:01,858
and then they have marbles on and

1454
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:03,180
you've put everyone puts a drop of

1455
00:52:03,220 --> 00:52:05,820

1456
00:52:05,850 --> 00:52:10,590

in the sticks yeah don't break the

1462
00:52:20,070 --> 00:52:21,510
ice you had all your ice cubes

1463
00:52:21,510 --> 00:52:22,590
and you had to tap them with

1464
00:52:22,590 --> 00:52:23,340
your little hammer

1465
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:25,470

my brother and i would play games

1502

together and get very there was like

1503
00:53:44,790 --> 00:53:47,610
a rule of whoever quit in the

1504
00:53:47,610 --> 00:53:50,100
middle had to pick up the game

1505
00:53:50,100 --> 00:53:51,180
because one

1506
00:53:51,180 --> 00:53:52,920
one of us eventually usually him would

1507
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:55,410
be like this is stupid in like

1508
00:53:55,470 --> 00:53:58,110
storm off and it was like ok

1509
00:53:58,110 --> 00:54:00,420
well you got a twitter quitter cleans

1510
00:54:00,420 --> 00:54:01,860
up the game and then it was

1511
00:54:01,860 --> 00:54:03,540
also winner cleans up the game because

1512
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:05,580
we were we were such bad winners

1513
00:54:06,060 --> 00:54:08,580
that you then had to like humble

1514
00:54:08,580 --> 00:54:10,830
yourself and clean up the game you

1515
00:54:10,830 --> 00:54:11,040
know

1516
00:54:11,340 --> 00:54:12,630
cause otherwise it would just be like

1517
00:54:12,750 --> 00:54:15,120
huh i'm so much better than you

1518
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:18,690

they had his body and then you

1531
00:54:41,190 --> 00:54:42,960

making me hungry

1533
00:54:47,850 --> 00:54:49,740
operation is like really perverted when you

00:54:49,740 --> 00:54:50,910
look look at this guy who's like

1535
00:54:50,910 --> 00:54:53,550

1536
00:54:53,550 --> 00:54:55,920
underwear like hey doctor i'm in love

1537
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:57,900
with you company oh i forgot that

1538
00:54:57,900 --> 00:55:00,090
it's all idioms or whatever yeah yeah

1539
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:04,110
funny bone and pencil dick and the

1540
00:55:04,140 --> 00:55:07,200
wishbones so hard wishbone so

1541
00:55:07,261 --> 00:55:10,260
hard one i had a i had

1542
00:55:10,260 --> 00:55:12,780
a monopoly book that was all about

1543
00:55:12,780 --> 00:55:17,130
strategy what a nerd my guide and

1544
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:19,140
read i would read it all the

1545
00:55:19,140 --> 00:55:21,900
time to sleep flashlight under the covers

1546
00:55:22,410 --> 00:55:24,540
and i was studying monopoly strategies i

1547
00:55:24,540 --> 00:55:26,400
remember like one of the strategies was

1548
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:27,420
hide your money because

1549
00:55:27,450 --> 00:55:31,350
there's no rule that says that your

1550
00:55:31,350 --> 00:55:33,420
money has to be visible in monopoly

1551
00:55:33,420 --> 00:55:35,220
so it was like you know take

1552
00:55:35,220 --> 00:55:37,380
an extra thousand dollars and hide it

1553
00:55:37,380 --> 00:55:39,900
under the board so that when your

1554
00:55:40,020 --> 00:55:41,790
you know your opponent thinks that you're

1555
00:55:41,850 --> 00:55:43,470
you're broke suddenly you break out that

1556
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:44,790
thousand dollars i remember i did that

1557
00:55:44,790 --> 00:55:46,332
one time my brother was like oh

1558
00:55:46,350 --> 00:55:47,580
and fare cheating

1559
00:55:47,580 --> 00:55:50,910
king and the board over and yeah

1560
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,410
i always like to i liked with

1561
00:55:52,428 --> 00:55:54,660
monopoly like organizing my money right under

1562
00:55:54,660 --> 00:55:56,700
the tip of the board like perfect

1563
00:55:56,700 --> 00:55:59,940
little ones and fives tens and twenties

1564
00:56:00,210 --> 00:56:01,230
and then i would always be the

1565
00:56:01,230 --> 00:56:04,110
scottie dog and i was always younger

1566
00:56:04,110 --> 00:56:04,920
and didn't know i was going on

1567
00:56:04,980 --> 00:56:06,840
was probably the worst person to have

1568
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:07,440
in there but

1569
00:56:08,070 --> 00:56:10,170

1570
00:56:10,170 --> 00:56:11,970

bye

1655
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:16,860
we are back and it's time for

1656
00:59:16,890 --> 00:59:20,010
one of our patented three jurors that's

1657
00:59:20,010 --> 00:59:21,390
right these are games that we play

1658
00:59:21,390 --> 00:59:25,200
submitted from audience suggestions and this was

1659
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:28,410
more yep please send us more we

1660
00:59:28,410 --> 00:59:31,260
are running out um and this

1661
00:59:31,322 --> 00:59:34,649
one was suggested by scott aquaman in

1662
00:59:34,649 --> 00:59:38,460
an early episode of three edam and

1663
00:59:38,460 --> 00:59:41,550
it's called pitcher sit song and the

1664
00:59:41,550 --> 00:59:44,040
way this works everyone knows what you

1665
00:59:44,040 --> 00:59:47,700
do is you take an existing sitcom

1666
00:59:47,730 --> 00:59:51,420
name you inward or tower

1667
00:59:51,420 --> 00:59:52,800
or any television show it could be

1668
00:59:52,830 --> 00:59:53,430
a one hour

1669
00:59:54,630 --> 00:59:57,810
fair enough sure then you do the

1670
00:59:57,930 --> 01:00:00,540
opposite of it yeah as the title

1671
01:00:00,870 --> 01:00:02,670
and then so the person that's coming

1672
01:00:02,700 --> 01:00:05,370
example if it was family matters it

1673
01:00:05,370 --> 01:00:07,830
would be it would be enemies don't

1674
01:00:07,830 --> 01:00:09,360
matter right

1675
01:00:10,140 --> 01:00:12,690
enemies are irrelevant they're the enemies of

1676
01:00:12,690 --> 01:00:14,040
the opposite family right

1677
01:00:15,330 --> 01:00:16,170
and so then

1678
01:00:17,910 --> 01:00:20,400
ah then another player has to come

1679
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:23,250
up with a theme song well that's

1680
01:00:23,250 --> 01:00:24,990
no that's that player doesn't that player

1681
01:00:24,990 --> 01:00:27,300
then pitch they'll show the one player

1682
01:00:27,300 --> 01:00:28,890
says here oh my god then the

1683
01:00:28,890 --> 01:00:30,090
other two players have to come up

1684
01:00:30,090 --> 01:00:30,840
with the theme song

1685
01:00:31,980 --> 01:00:32,940
and they have to describe what the

1686
01:00:32,940 --> 01:00:33,480
show is

1687
01:00:35,055 --> 01:00:36,150
yes because like this it goes like

1688
01:00:36,150 --> 01:00:38,430
this the fourth the one person comes

1689
01:00:38,430 --> 01:00:40,830
up with the name the other the

1690
01:00:40,860 --> 01:00:42,210
next person has to stay with the

1691
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:43,770
opposite and title would be and the

1692
01:00:43,799 --> 01:00:44,910
third person who's theme song

1693
01:00:46,170 --> 01:00:47,970
the well that but the pitch you

1694
01:00:47,970 --> 01:00:49,440
guys are forgetting about the pitching part

1695
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:50,880
of it like the the two people

1696
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:52,470
have to have to pitch to the

1697
01:00:52,470 --> 01:00:55,350
person who gave the original sitcom they

1698
01:00:55,350 --> 01:00:56,790
have to pitch the show so i

1699
01:00:56,790 --> 01:00:58,560
say to lauryn happy days lauren has

1700
01:00:58,560 --> 01:01:00,510
to come up with sad mad months

1701
01:01:00,840 --> 01:01:02,970
got in and definitely what that show

1702
01:01:02,970 --> 01:01:04,410
is the two of us have to

1703
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:06,245
then pitch it and go okay this

1704
01:01:06,245 --> 01:01:06,300
is

1705
01:01:07,030 --> 01:01:08,770
sad months and then we pitched the

1706
01:01:08,770 --> 01:01:10,330
show and then at the end paul

1707
01:01:10,330 --> 01:01:11,680
says well i really wanna hear what

1708
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:13,058
the theme song is and then we'd

1709
01:01:13,058 --> 01:01:15,190
sing the theme song and we do

1710
01:01:15,190 --> 01:01:15,940
it over zoom

1711
01:01:18,130 --> 01:01:20,560
okay so paul do you want to

1712
01:01:20,560 --> 01:01:22,390

01:01:37,510 --> 01:01:39,250
god i'm very glad i hear great

1718
01:01:39,250 --> 01:01:41,110
things about you too you're you're burning

1719
01:01:41,110 --> 01:01:42,730
up the internet when all of the

1720
01:01:42,730 --> 01:01:44,290
things that you do we are a

1721
01:01:44,290 --> 01:01:47,013
brother sister writing team of queer brothers

1722
01:01:47,013 --> 01:01:49,630
sister role i married well we were

1723
01:01:49,630 --> 01:01:51,820
featured on siblings are dating and we

1724
01:01:51,850 --> 01:01:52,360
hope that

1725
01:01:52,360 --> 01:01:54,010
that's why i'm thinking that yes yeah

1726
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:56,014
we were heavily featured on that yeah

1727
01:01:56,014 --> 01:01:58,090
um and you know we came up

1728
01:01:58,090 --> 01:02:00,070
with this idea and it's been yeah

1729
01:02:00,130 --> 01:02:02,680
take getting so much traction it's called

1730
01:02:02,680 --> 01:02:04,660
moth box wave so you've been taking

1731
01:02:04,660 --> 01:02:06,640
these other places oh yeah no we

1732
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:08,200
just post your last on our list

1733
01:02:08,530 --> 01:02:09,940
and yeah we did pitch to a

1734
01:02:09,940 --> 01:02:11,320
few places but we places are so

1735
01:02:11,350 --> 01:02:12,520
this is our safety this is

1736
01:02:12,550 --> 01:02:14,620
if the first twenty places turn us

1737
01:02:14,620 --> 01:02:16,240
down right so what we say well

1738
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:17,650
you say it's gaining a lot of

1739
01:02:17,650 --> 01:02:19,870
traction what does that mean exact people

1740
01:02:19,870 --> 01:02:23,050
online love the idea completely out on

1741
01:02:23,140 --> 01:02:24,610
you put it online for free oh

1742
01:02:24,610 --> 01:02:25,720
yeah because we want to just see

1743
01:02:25,720 --> 01:02:27,400
what you know we've already made the

1744
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:29,080
show and it's aired already on a

1745
01:02:29,080 --> 01:02:29,950
competing network

1746
01:02:31,570 --> 01:02:33,040
but that network is going under and

1747
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:35,350
so we need to get it's creepy

1748
01:02:35,350 --> 01:02:36,460
we should just say it is creepy

1749
01:02:37,870 --> 01:02:39,970
quick bytes quiz actually queso

1750
01:02:40,900 --> 01:02:44,950
that's right quick so no melted cheese

1751
01:02:45,790 --> 01:02:47,890
please so yeah so anyway it's called

1752
01:02:47,890 --> 01:02:51,430
moth box and look smooth box and

1753
01:02:51,430 --> 01:02:53,500
we want to pitch you the essentially

1754
01:02:53,500 --> 01:02:55,990
the the story the idea the characters

1755
01:02:56,080 --> 01:02:57,040
i want to get all of those

1756
01:02:57,070 --> 01:03:00,760
the single old man lives

1757
01:03:00,760 --> 01:03:04,178
is alone and he is you know

1758
01:03:04,433 --> 01:03:06,670
we probably see his his relationship with

1759
01:03:06,670 --> 01:03:09,550
his wife for over the past seventy

1760
01:03:09,550 --> 01:03:12,370
years from them dating to them you

1761
01:03:12,370 --> 01:03:14,735
know living together or so getting it

1762
01:03:14,735 --> 01:03:16,583
good and they never get divorced they

1763
01:03:16,583 --> 01:03:17,920
they say they don't live together for

1764
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:19,060
a brief period but they move back

1765
01:03:19,060 --> 01:03:20,920
in yeah they patch things up

1766
01:03:20,920 --> 01:03:22,690
up and then she dies and there's

1767
01:03:22,690 --> 01:03:24,850
a funeral and that's all done with

1768
01:03:24,850 --> 01:03:26,919
like a really sentimental montage and he

1769
01:03:26,919 --> 01:03:28,780
doesn't tie balloons to his house does

1770
01:03:28,780 --> 01:03:31,150
he he can if you like though

1771
01:03:31,888 --> 01:03:34,270
i mean one point yeah he does

1772
01:03:34,570 --> 01:03:36,850
so what he'd actually glee when he

1773
01:03:36,850 --> 01:03:39,490
does show my brother my brother kind

1774
01:03:39,490 --> 01:03:41,080
of misspoke what he does

1775
01:03:41,110 --> 01:03:42,400
is he doesn't tie balloons but he

1776
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:44,860
ties gigantic moth wings so the top

1777
01:03:44,860 --> 01:03:46,570
of his house which he ditched together

1778
01:03:46,570 --> 01:03:48,640
from hundreds and thousands of mammoth sort

1779
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:49,780
of died over the year because our

1780
01:03:49,810 --> 01:03:52,210
relationship so it's kind of symbolic of

1781
01:03:52,210 --> 01:03:54,250
the you know death of his relationship

1782
01:03:54,250 --> 01:03:57,010
and then also the rebirth could you

1783
01:03:57,010 --> 01:03:58,270
not sit on his lap while you

1784
01:03:58,300 --> 01:04:00,220
do the pitch it's just more comfortable

1785
01:04:00,220 --> 01:04:01,240
for me it's just

1786
01:04:01,240 --> 01:04:02,800
attracting it's very distracting

1787
01:04:03,940 --> 01:04:05,350
she can stop bouncing up and down

1788
01:04:05,350 --> 01:04:06,670
if you want okay but if you

1789
01:04:06,730 --> 01:04:08,800
stop kissing her neck i like that

1790
01:04:08,860 --> 01:04:11,290
list no problem no problem so anyway

1791
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:14,050
ah i don't think you said you

1792
01:04:14,050 --> 01:04:15,550
would stop oh i think i've started

1793
01:04:15,700 --> 01:04:18,400
no stop you said oh doing it

1794
01:04:18,670 --> 01:04:19,930
no no well that's why i thought

1795
01:04:19,930 --> 01:04:20,980
it was so weird when you said

1796
01:04:20,980 --> 01:04:21,400
start

1797
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:26,860
anyway if we have sex here no

1798
01:04:28,660 --> 01:04:31,180
anyway so ma to the pitch he

1799
01:04:31,210 --> 01:04:33,130
he ties these moth wings to his

1800
01:04:33,130 --> 01:04:35,650
house they flap up up in a

1801
01:04:35,650 --> 01:04:37,150
way like one make a race lap

1802
01:04:37,930 --> 01:04:41,050
the sort of just inherent their their

1803
01:04:41,050 --> 01:04:43,840
knowledge yeah they have like muscle memory

1804
01:04:44,050 --> 01:04:45,460
yeah you know what i mean they

1805
01:04:45,460 --> 01:04:46,388
want to go up and down it's

1806
01:04:46,388 --> 01:04:48,040
sort of natural yes nach

1807
01:04:48,040 --> 01:04:49,120
natural to want to go up and

1808
01:04:49,120 --> 01:04:52,060
down right honey a kobach come on

1809
01:04:52,060 --> 01:04:54,370
guys it's okay but have you ever

1810
01:04:54,370 --> 01:04:55,630
seen a brother and sister do this

1811
01:04:56,830 --> 01:04:58,900
stop that please

1812
01:05:00,070 --> 01:05:01,660
this is a place of business

1813
01:05:02,770 --> 01:05:05,890
i think this is good so anyway

1814
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:07,480
it's a it's a box with moth

1815
01:05:07,480 --> 01:05:08,980
wings on it and it flies up

1816
01:05:08,980 --> 01:05:11,410
into the sun and explodes by it

1817
01:05:11,650 --> 01:05:13,750
way and really what's so great about

1818
01:05:13,750 --> 01:05:16,270
it is that it's about relationships it's

1819
01:05:16,270 --> 01:05:18,849
about you know sure bad relationship with

1820
01:05:18,849 --> 01:05:21,490
relationships is it about just this one

1821
01:05:21,490 --> 01:05:22,840
guy and his wife

1822
01:05:22,870 --> 01:05:26,230
who wasn't around anymore and so rosemary

1823
01:05:26,260 --> 01:05:28,120
lee know and then it's lost all

1824
01:05:28,120 --> 01:05:30,310
the moth wings to each other he

1825
01:05:30,310 --> 01:05:31,990
talks to the camera and it's exploring

1826
01:05:31,990 --> 01:05:34,900

out of countless dead ma

1840
01:06:03,160 --> 01:06:05,050
awww sad takes like ten seconds yeah

1841
01:06:05,050 --> 01:06:07,600
and it's honestly to higher love that

1842
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:09,280

1852
01:06:26,680 --> 01:06:29,140

01:06:40,330 --> 01:06:42,730
they don't give them permission okay but

1861
01:06:42,730 --> 01:06:44,830
does the audience they privy to any

1862
01:06:44,830 --> 01:06:46,690
of this any of the the fire

1863
01:06:46,690 --> 01:06:49,810
mar sending were sending footnotes and send

1864
01:06:49,810 --> 01:06:51,910
a packet to every house and then

1867
01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:57,730

talk about that and it's really exciting

1870
01:07:01,540 --> 01:07:03,370
because what it is is the app

1871
01:07:03,370 --> 01:07:04,810
works like a viewfinder and you hold

1872
01:07:04,810 --> 01:07:05,560
it up to the tv and you

1873
01:07:05,560 --> 01:07:07,060

01:07:07,060 --> 01:07:08,440
your phone so you actually have to

1875
01:07:08,440 --> 01:07:10,000
look at your phone the whole time

1876
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:11,710
if you hire a time yeah yeah

1877
01:07:11,740 --> 01:07:13,322
