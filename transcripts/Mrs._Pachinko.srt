00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:22,800

26
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:23,970

00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:31,410
yeah we're allowed to talk about that

31
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,300
we're allowed to talk about it we're

32
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:34,830
not taste-testing them when you go with

33
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:36,540
em and em snow we only do

34
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:38,880
that with candy and yes we call

35
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,160
ourselves the doughboys but who cares the

36
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,960
dual gang private thing

37
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:47,400
um i think currently in and out

38
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,620
is where i go into currently for

39
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:53,190
burgers um but didn't now it could

40
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:55,230
change at any moment it really could

41
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:58,230
who knows what's happening um but you

42
00:01:58,230 --> 00:01:59,610
know i don't know i've liked carl's

43
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:00,930
junior over the years but it's really

44
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,610
iffy like if you get a cold

45
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:03,107
burger

46
00:02:03,165 --> 00:02:05,070
not you know so well this is

47
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:06,390
what i was saying that i have

48
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:08,310
been into in and out lately i've

49
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:11,160
just been treating myself and to some

50
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:14,190
but i don't consider it fast food

51
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:16,350
really because i think of it as

52
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:18,930
healthier slash more natural but i think

53
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:21,240
i'm making that up to me you

54
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,890
are feel what i owe

55
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:25,830
what i said to lauren was anything

56
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:28,260
that you can order from your car

57
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:30,570
is fast food and it's five dollars

58
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:32,250
total for the whole meal which doesn't

59
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:34,950
really bode well for how great quality

60
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:37,170
it is i guess you know it's

61
00:02:37,359 --> 00:02:38,400
more expensive well if i got a

62
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,450
camera i just get a hamburger and

63
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:40,380
fries and it's like a little over

64
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:42,960
five dollars right right well with the

65
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,380
lines

66
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,700
ing as long as they are is

67
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,470
it really that fast that's a good

68
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:49,170
ass oh yeah you know i don't

69
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,390
eat fast food much anymore but when

70
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:52,980
i do have a craving for it

71
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:55,110
my last shiny more by

72
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:00,000
mr saturday i wait just a billy

73
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,720
crystal's parody that's right um i don't

74
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,520
i do what's going on when i

75
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,050
do get a craving for it i

76
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:09,270
think it's either mcdonald's or kentucky fried

77
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:12,240
chicken are my things i like the

78
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,100
chicken nuggets they've gotten better over time

79
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,420
because they made it with real because

80
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:16,320
they started will they

81
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:17,790
made with real chicken with real chicken

82
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:20,190
now and before it was pink glue

83
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,680
yeah was just chicken coup which i

84
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,630
would eat even if i knew that

85
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:27,780
comes out of a chicken's bottle yeah

86
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:29,010
when chickens lay eggs there's this this

87
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:30,870
pink goo that surrounds it and see

88
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:32,700
what just deep fry that yeah it's

89
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,320
like the chicken placenta anyway this is

90
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,910
a real question do eggs come out

91
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:36,480
of the butt hole

92
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,970

93
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:43,800
the filmmakers oh chloe always slow boat

94
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,290
broad makeup i think that's what it

95
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:47,152
is but holy shit

96
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:51,480
um it's all a mystery to me

97
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:55,440
like yeah it's god's plan ah why

98
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,480
eggs are what they are

99
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:01,380
oh wait guys i'm so proud of

100
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:02,333
myself that i knew what a co

101
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:06,030
waco was right um the posterior orifice

102
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:08,760
that serves as the only opening for

103
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:12,235
the j digestive reproductive and oh near

104
00:04:12,235 --> 00:04:14,700
near the tracks really so it's the

105
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:16,050
trait you get the trifecta and then

106
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:18,720
it's pee and eggs wow

107
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,400
wow that's why stems your aches have

108
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,230

124
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:00,120
may be more than lauren but when

125
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:03,150
president nixon well yes of course i

126
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:04,920
didn't do you remember when people started

127
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:07,590
getting tattoos yes ah in the nineties

128
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:09,360
and how just how i remember

129
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,650
seeing it now because i remember in

130
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:12,030
a script that my friend and i

131
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:14,130
wrote together there was like characters were

132
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:15,990
having a whole conversation about would you

133
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:18,090
date a woman with a tattoo this

134
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:21,540
is back in ninety three this was

135
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:23,070
you and your friend jerry seinfeld yes

136
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:24,750
of course and he was like i

137
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:27,150
don't know um but yeah it was

138
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,520
it's so strange how just commonplace

139
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,380
face it is now i guess in

140
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:34,170
thirty years anything is can become commonplace

141
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:36,150
but i it seemed to happen relatively

142
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:39,330
quickly leaving yeah i remember when tattoos

143
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:41,880
became like what right before i moved

144
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,810
to l a

145
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:46,170
no i'm gonna say like ah i

146
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:48,300
remember meeting a ah i had a

147
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:49,620
friend who had a bunch of tattoos

148
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:51,300
and at that time that was very

149
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,250
unusual for someone to be to have

150
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:55,890
multiple tattoos and this would have been

151
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:58,500
like the early nineties and what was

152
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,090
the perception of that person at that

153
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:02,190
time at that time it was like

154
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:03,750
gosh ah

155
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,010
are they going to want that for

156
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:05,910
the rest of their life i do

157
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:08,820
i do remember one of the people

158
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:10,170
in my church growing up had a

159
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:11,970
big he was in the navy or

160
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:13,350
he had been in the navy and

161
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:14,580
he had a big and hanker you

162
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:17,280
don't sail the seven seas sure he

163
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,050
had a big anchor tattoo on his

164
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,090
arm and that was like sort of

165
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:24,150
had scandic yeah he was famous

166
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:27,090
but it was sort of scandalous in

167
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:28,380
the church in a way of people

168
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:30,450
going like well obviously he's not supposed

169
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:31,620
to have that but he was in

170
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:33,780
the navy before he joined the church

171
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:37,320
and so i think there was interesting

172
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,660
for me it was like definitely at

173
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:41,760
that at that time in the early

174
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:43,740
i would say in the early nineties

175
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:44,400
it

176
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,490
it was sort of a ah almost

177
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:50,520
a subculture thing of like that's that's

178
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:53,580
a certain that's a certain ah you

179
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:56,280
know ah to say you know social

180
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,200
circle or whatever i can't think of

181
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,090
the term but that's that's i guess

182
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:01,650
cultures starting culture that yeah there's a

183
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:03,300
lot of tattoos you didn't see a

184
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:04,230
lot of

185
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,720
especially women with tattoos unless yeah it

186
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,950
was like in the punk scene or

187
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:10,020
whatever yeah they weren't normalized she and

188
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:11,550
she was a musician yeah so it

189
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:13,530
was like that was who had tattoos

190
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,930
you know it's normalized across fashion or

191
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:18,540
fashion photography yeah yeah yeah so it

192
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:21,090
was whenever you'd see like someone i

193
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:22,110
would work with at one of my

194
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:23,190
previous restaurants

195
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:25,560
we'd come in and have like a

196
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,240
bad tattoo or whatever you'd go like

197
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:29,490
god put your shirt on

198
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,120
we're in a restaurant not to mention

199
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,120
your pants um but it would just

200
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,770
be like god you're eighteen is that

201
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:39,540
really something like you know should you

202
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:40,830
be making that choice and now of

203
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:42,630
course it's like anyone can get a

204
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:44,070
tattoo and i feel like the thing

205
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:46,590
right now is like anyone gets can

206
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:47,910
get a tattoo anyone will get a

207
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:50,340
tattoo and they'll get um a lot

208
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:50,880
of people i

209
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:52,470
i know in my life have gotten

210
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:54,900
impulsive tattoos that they don't like and

211
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,190
then they cover with another tattoo so

212
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:57,210
it's just like there's kind of no

213
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:58,980
risk and feels like at this point

214
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,349
yeah i mean i don't think sending

215
00:08:01,349 --> 00:08:02,880
it seems like a judgment risk like

216
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,500
people would judge you yeah nobody thinks

217
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,960
anything of it now yeah didn't like

218
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,610
starbucks employees back in the day had

219
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:10,380
to cover up their tattoos and stuff

220
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,040
while dis

221
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,290

222
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:15,450
disneyland employees they just are now or

223
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:18,245

00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:51,390
lady pirates not being a thing

239
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:53,670
early nineties

240
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:56,610
i'm at disneyland they when i worked

241
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:59,190
there they you had to keep your

242
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,230
hair you know a certain length and

243
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:02,460
above the ears and all this kinda

244
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:03,870
stuff and you couldn't you know show

245
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:05,490
any of your tattoos and you're seeing

246
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:07,230
your hat on there yeah yeah of

247
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:09,180
course a bird air air and air

248
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:12,510
air now and keep your animal head

249
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:13,830
on all the time even when you

250
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:14,580
just worked out

251
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:16,740
you could take off the bottom

252
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:21,600
but they they just last week when

253
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,850
they reopened they now are being more

254
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:26,640
inclusive for people of different hair styles

255
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:32,009
which culturally um you know people want

256
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,440
that's important yeah exactly so and the

257
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,450
tattoos they're letting that be expression and

258
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:37,560
all that kind of stuff so now

259
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:37,890
by

260
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:40,740
inclusive hair styles does that mean that

261
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:42,270
means black people right are allowed to

262
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:43,470
wear their hair the way they like

263
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,840
pretty much yeah but because i think

264
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,280
that's what but i mean that's just

265
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,590
i'm sure it also is like this

266
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:51,570
is not a professional hairdo it also

267
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:53,070
would have to mean i think people

268
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:54,600
who are wearing wraps and so i

269
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,002
don't know what their policy on on

270
00:09:57,002 --> 00:09:58,080
roadshow we're

271
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,570
or to not allow that stuff when

272
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:02,610
the whole premise of like the place

273
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:04,680
is all these different worlds and different

274
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,870
cultures and different sex you know maybe

275
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:08,100
like it's all you got oh right

276
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:08,670
about it

277
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,510
i was thinking about it about disneyland

278
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:13,680
because when i worked there in eighty

279
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,860
seven or eighty eight um that that

280
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:19,740
seemed like the point where suddenly they

281
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:23,490
started being more inclusive across the board

282
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:25,020
like as a company you know that

283
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:27,087
you learn yeah

284
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:30,570
no it just seemed like they started

285
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:32,190
having like this is a bold step

286
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:34,110
forward for us we're now allowing dorks

287
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:34,740
to work here

288
00:10:36,997 --> 00:10:40,922
ah

289
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,130
warren it's offending me that you thought

290
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:44,880
that was so funny

291
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:50,370
ah i didn't even have my money

292
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,020
i'd even say it but i did

293
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:53,460
that route

294
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:56,370
yeah there was like a side note

295
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,690
i don't know if you ever told

296
00:10:57,690 --> 00:11:00,360
your bear bear story on the podcast

297
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,230
this is the first time i met

298
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:02,429
you is when you did ask and

299
00:11:02,429 --> 00:11:06,930
you told oh yeah i mean okay

300
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:08,250
so i used to work at disneyland

301
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,630
this is not part of restaurant roundup

302
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:11,220

304
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:15,119
not part of restaurant roundup this is

305
00:11:15,119 --> 00:11:17,430

306
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:19,500

three miles

313
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:35,640
away from it so i would go

314
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,080
to house i would go to it

315
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,780
every year ah you know i was

316
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:40,740

kid when they had e tickets and

318
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,860

324
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,160
you heard ah oh wow that's an

325
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:58,590
e ticket experience that like cliche or

326
00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:00,240
like well yeah you know and that's

327
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,540
what special yeah so so disneyland for

328
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:05,400
those of you who aren't steeped in

329
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:09,270
disneyland lore around nineteen eighty two or

330
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:10,980
eighty three or eighty four something eighty

331
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,810
five or eighty six u seven eighty

332
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:13,080
eight

333
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:16,170
nine would be too easy when you

334
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:17,280
when you bought a ticket for the

335
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:19,260
park you could go anywhere in the

336
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:23,130
park but before that you were when

337
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:24,330
you bought a ticket for the park

338
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:25,980
you are you are given a coupon

339
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:29,190
book okay and they had and the

340
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:31,500
coupon book had a certain allotment of

341
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:33,240
e tickets a certain allotment of

342
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:35,550
d tickets a certain allotment of a

343
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:38,430
b c d e right and e

344
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:41,070
tickets were a ticket you and everyone

345
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:42,030
apparently you don't

346
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:45,840
because you want an e ticket experience

347
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:49,230
every ride had a had a sign

348
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:50,970
that said what ticket would get you

349
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:52,560
on to that ride and the best

350
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,870
rides have the e tickets right so

351
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:56,070
you could get on like the eight

352
00:12:56,070 --> 00:12:57,870
tickets were worthless you could get on

353
00:12:57,870 --> 00:13:00,360
like the train that goes around the

354
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:03,300
whole park fuck right so but ever

355
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:06,060
anything good everything in fantasy land or

356
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,560
you know space mountain and all that

357
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:10,050
they were all ticket rides and and

358
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:13,170
you could buy extra books but you

359
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:15,210
couldn't just buy e tickets right so

360
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:16,920
you would if you went there several

361
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,480
times like i would go every single

362
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,680
year with my parents you just had

363
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,780
a stack of a tickets like sitting

364
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:23,370
in your collections that you would never

365
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:23,460
see

366
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:25,050
spend and then the ease you wouldn't

367
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:26,310
like take one day and ride the

368
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:30,630
train for twenty four hours well yeah

369
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:33,120
for twenty four hours yeah like your

370
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,760
bag again once you get on one

371
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,410
so you can ride as long as

372
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:39,210
you want that so it doesn't really

373
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:40,980
get rid of whatever yeah they let

374
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:42,180
you sit on the train all day

375
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:43,620
if you want yeah yeah because

376
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:44,850
there's three stops to and they don't

377
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:46,260
know when you got on or got

378
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:47,670
off so it's like literally you could

379
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:48,750
sit there and just go around the

380
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:50,220
train the entire time i feel like

381
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:51,630
there's only three stops i would begin

382
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:54,330
to know when that person do not

383
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:57,360
give one shit i think you've been

384
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,580
on longer than the three stops

385
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:03,270
um but so yeah i grew up

386
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:05,160
going to disneyland and and having the

387
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,240
ticket books and all that kind of

388
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,710
stuff and so so i was always

389
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:09,360
very fascinated with it so and i

390
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,500
always wanted to work there and i

391
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,870
would always sort of like look at

392
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:15,476
the how you know that i started

393
00:14:15,478 --> 00:14:16,650
do that with every place i kind

394
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:18,120
of look at the design and look

395
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,190
at how you know i like go

396
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:20,490
oh

397
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,500
it must work this way like the

398
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,360
shift works this way like these people

399
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,710

400
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:26,760
are like when you go to olive

00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,050
garden like i think they come out

402
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:30,690
of that back room and i think

403
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:32,010
i don't know maybe it has come

404
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:32,970
to me that a hurdle

405
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:36,060
whenever they take the paper they go

406
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:38,100
back through that whole know but i

407
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,990

00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:53,520
chain where it was like when you're

had a heart ah it's locally literally

425
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,380
was like a valentine's heart with yeah

426
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:22,020
cursive weil's disease and i said it's

427
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:23,850
a huge sign i feel like i

428
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:27,300
off suburban diana you know when you

429
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,373
stop in the middle of nowhere i

430
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:28,500
think

431
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:29,970
we used to love going there that

432
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:31,230
was like the special night that i

433
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:32,670
used to love we go to yes

434
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,520
and it would be great because like

435
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:37,560
i could get a half a chick

436
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:39,000
not have a full half a chicken

437
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,620
but an order of half chicken half

438
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:43,260
steak bbq you know like just like

439
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:45,360
i loved going to i love going

440
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,920
there but they had one of those

441
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,660
things up in the restaurant of the

442
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:52,860
the electronic sign or panel that had

443
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:55,110
all the numbers on it that when

444
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:56,940
the wind up to involve numbers in

445
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:58,350
the world so it would be like

446
00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:00,810
one to thirty right of like your

447
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:03,240
ticket number your ticket exactly so like

448
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,850
suddenly it would light up and i

449
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:07,110
would just sit there while i was

450
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:08,820
eating and because you know it

451
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:09,780
it would take so long to get

452
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:10,800
the food and you would get there

453
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,090
really hungry and it would just take

454
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:14,940
forever when you feel like so fast

455
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,060
so i would i would try to

456
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:20,310
guess which number was ours and i

457
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:21,870
would be like taking a look at

458
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:23,490
the whenever like a number would light

459
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:25,710
up in our waitress would would hurry

460
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:27,930
back to the kitchen and it wouldn't

461
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:29,220
be ours i'd be like ok so

462
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:31,710
is that which she must have the

463
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:34,590
the numbers fifteen through twenty so if

464
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:35,460
any of those light up

465
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:36,660
that means our food is lighting up

466
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:38,250
anyway so i've always been fascinated with

467
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:41,220
like how places work you know um

468
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:42,270
so i really want to work at

469
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:44,010
disneyland just because i wanted to know

470
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:45,780
how it worked and there were all

471
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:48,990
these buzz kill not for me no

472
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:50,640
i i love that to me i'm

473
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,170
like i kinda don't want to know

474
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:53,700
like really know too much so i'm

475
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:55,620
like oh yeah comes the garbage

476
00:16:55,830 --> 00:16:57,360
picker upper person and then you know

477
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:59,430
it takes away from this right because

478
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:02,190
there's a whole fantasy with disneyland which

479
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:04,110
advanced isn't that why you think it's

480
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:07,320
not real where they say that all

481
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:10,110
the garbage goes underneath and gets emptied

482
00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:10,860
but then i've seen people up to

483
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:12,210
the garbage and i'm like well there's

484
00:17:12,210 --> 00:17:15,000
all there's all these like the the

485
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:15,750
garbage goes

486
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:18,600
under the street so that the the

487
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:21,030
trash cans are never under there and

488
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:22,590
then they're always being removed under me

489
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:25,800
but i don't think that's true because

490
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,390
i've seen them be overflowing and i've

491
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:29,250
also seen people emptying them yeah exactly

492
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:31,680
so i don't also seems wildly impractical

493
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:33,420
even but i think it's a great

494
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:35,940
idea but there are these like legends

495
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:37,950
that you hear about and some of

496
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:39,510
them are true like the graveyard behind

497
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:41,040
the haunted mansion that no one can

498
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:43,590
see and and but there was always

499
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:45,330
the one to beg your pardon there's

500
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,310
like a little graveyard behind the haunted

501
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:50,400
mansion that's not real republic it's not

502
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,050
a real graveyard but it's like a

503
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:54,120
fake people are buried there yeah so

504
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,230
you know that's the one where you're

505
00:17:55,230 --> 00:17:56,100
in line and you can see

506
00:17:56,130 --> 00:17:58,020
the graves are like i died is

507
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:59,100
like the name of the person or

508
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,080
something i mean these are these are

509
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,610
ones i've never even seen them because

510
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:04,170
you can't see them unless you work

511
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:05,640
there or go on to a special

512
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,740
tour or they let you see them

513
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:09,330
but but it has like animators names

514
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:10,920
on it back there and people worked

515
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,540
on the ride and stares him an

516
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:16,260

i listened to his episode and it

520
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:24,270
was really interesting so i don't know

521
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:25,620
how to find it besides searching that

522
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:27,120
but um but yeah there were there

523
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,340

stuff like that that you hear about

526
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:35,940
and um so anyway i really want

527
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:36,390
to work there

528
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:38,580

if you know how something works

537
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,690

00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:35,700

558
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:36,180

559
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:37,950
the reservations now and i was reading

560
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:39,870
that um a lot of the reservations

561
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:43,020
are going unclaimed because people will if

562
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:44,370
they're going to pay the bio they

563
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:46,560
want the full experience because there's no

564
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,750
paredes there right you know yeah that's

565
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:49,830
still fun i want to go when

566
00:19:49,837 --> 00:19:52,320
it's good yeah so i went to

567
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,600
these auditions which were they combine it

568
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,340
into parade and character

569
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:58,260
oh and i quickly found out that

570
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:00,540
the parade people were a higher class

571
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:01,740
or they were viewed as a higher

572
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:03,600
class of people i should say so

573
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:06,720
um and only the best people got

574
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,000
accepted into the parade but then the

575
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:10,920
rest of you could get into characters

576
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,150
and it was loud i'm sorry i'm

577
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:14,340
sorry my best people what what did

578
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:15,780
you have to demonstrate to be one

579
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:16,500
of the best people

580
00:20:17,125 --> 00:20:19,225
and it's basically a dance and movement

581
00:20:19,225 --> 00:20:20,935
audition which is something that i'm not

582
00:20:20,935 --> 00:20:24,445
like incredibly comfortable doing at least at

583
00:20:24,445 --> 00:20:27,295
the time but i now you're very

584
00:20:27,295 --> 00:20:27,775
free

585
00:20:29,455 --> 00:20:30,955
but at the time i i'd gotten

586
00:20:30,955 --> 00:20:32,875
into plays and stuff by basically like

587
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:35,035
doing dorky shit and not not looking

588
00:20:35,035 --> 00:20:37,015
good doing it but like being funny

589
00:20:37,015 --> 00:20:39,025
at it yeah right sold it but

590
00:20:39,025 --> 00:20:40,855
you had to do a choreographed dance

591
00:20:40,855 --> 00:20:41,665
and then you had to do a

592
00:20:41,665 --> 00:20:44,515
freestyle movement kind of stuff and so

593
00:20:45,265 --> 00:20:46,585
i went and did it and i

594
00:20:46,585 --> 00:20:48,565
actually got a call back but they

595
00:20:48,565 --> 00:20:49,045
said not

596
00:20:49,105 --> 00:20:52,465
for parade for character so um so

597
00:20:52,465 --> 00:20:53,635
i said ok and then they did

598
00:20:53,635 --> 00:20:55,615
if we covered you from head to

599
00:20:55,615 --> 00:20:56,215
toe

600
00:20:58,705 --> 00:21:00,865
so they took my height and they

601
00:21:01,005 --> 00:21:03,265
i eventually actually got the job and

602
00:21:03,265 --> 00:21:04,165
it ended up being one of the

603
00:21:04,165 --> 00:21:06,985
worst jobs i've ever had um checks

604
00:21:06,985 --> 00:21:10,615
out it was like ah two very

605
00:21:10,645 --> 00:21:13,945
calendars it's like ray counters is fun

606
00:21:13,945 --> 00:21:15,655
because it's like everyone is your age

607
00:21:15,715 --> 00:21:17,245
you're all just like you get drunk

608
00:21:17,245 --> 00:21:17,605
eat out

609
00:21:17,635 --> 00:21:19,504
the faster i get it i'm saying

610
00:21:19,577 --> 00:21:21,442
hit on by tons of women it's

611
00:21:21,445 --> 00:21:24,835
like ah lady you dress like a

612
00:21:24,835 --> 00:21:28,015
banana yeah that was good but but

613
00:21:28,075 --> 00:21:30,055
as a character you are yes you're

614
00:21:30,055 --> 00:21:31,675
covered from head to foot and one

615
00:21:31,675 --> 00:21:33,115
thing that i didn't realize is because

616
00:21:33,115 --> 00:21:35,605
i'm six two and a half the

617
00:21:35,635 --> 00:21:37,735
type staff in their characters

618
00:21:37,765 --> 00:21:39,655
that i would play where all of

619
00:21:39,655 --> 00:21:44,485
the super tall cumbersome uncomfortable so like

620
00:21:44,575 --> 00:21:48,715
goofy goofy is okay because goofy is

621
00:21:48,715 --> 00:21:51,865
not taller than what you are um

622
00:21:51,865 --> 00:21:54,895
meaning the worst ones were like breyer

623
00:21:54,895 --> 00:21:57,475
bear and little john from robin hood

624
00:21:57,475 --> 00:21:57,882
because

625
00:21:57,925 --> 00:22:00,085
they are in the eight feet variety

626
00:22:00,475 --> 00:22:02,635
which means they're like two feet taller

627
00:22:02,635 --> 00:22:04,465
much yeah there are too many taller

628
00:22:04,465 --> 00:22:06,205
than you you know for the experience

629
00:22:06,235 --> 00:22:07,705
you know but if you

630
00:22:08,995 --> 00:22:11,215
but if you're a little kid like

631
00:22:11,215 --> 00:22:13,315
six feet is tall and then you

632
00:22:13,345 --> 00:22:16,219
look like an eight foot tall bears

633
00:22:16,255 --> 00:22:17,785
better know you gotta be compared to

634
00:22:17,785 --> 00:22:19,315
goofy yeah yeah to think about the

635
00:22:19,315 --> 00:22:21,925
other people it's like you got i

636
00:22:24,145 --> 00:22:25,975
who gives us like is there any

637
00:22:25,975 --> 00:22:27,775
little kids get a warriors sugar you're

638
00:22:28,015 --> 00:22:30,085
holding up the corner they're the same

639
00:22:30,085 --> 00:22:32,095
size thinking of that that picture of

640
00:22:32,095 --> 00:22:34,105
biden with the carters is like yeah

641
00:22:34,135 --> 00:22:35,275
i keep staring at it i'm like

642
00:22:35,275 --> 00:22:37,885
lesser things biden looks like breyer it's

643
00:22:37,885 --> 00:22:40,915
so confusing it's wild that my sister

644
00:22:40,945 --> 00:22:42,835
understand that after you're president you start

645
00:22:42,835 --> 00:22:43,045
to show

646
00:22:43,045 --> 00:22:43,495
shrink

647
00:22:45,096 --> 00:22:46,675
have an obama i live in a

648
00:22:46,675 --> 00:22:48,775
tiny hell obama is three feet tall

649
00:22:48,775 --> 00:22:50,485
at this point i'm truly just so

650
00:22:50,515 --> 00:22:52,945
confused like i i can't even zoom

651
00:22:52,945 --> 00:22:54,025
didn't i was like i still don't

652
00:22:54,025 --> 00:22:56,245
understand the perspective like they're not far

653
00:22:56,245 --> 00:22:57,805
enough in front of them that it'll

654
00:22:57,805 --> 00:22:59,725
be that it looks like a really

655
00:22:59,875 --> 00:23:01,765
it's it's a wide angle lens thing

656
00:23:01,795 --> 00:23:04,135
right if you if you're shooting with

657
00:23:04,135 --> 00:23:04,885
a wide angle lens

658
00:23:05,035 --> 00:23:07,015
depending on the body outside of the

659
00:23:07,015 --> 00:23:09,475
details of the layoffs will appear bigger

660
00:23:09,475 --> 00:23:11,335
yeah yeah it gets stretched yeah and

661
00:23:11,335 --> 00:23:12,625
the carters didn't want to move their

662
00:23:12,625 --> 00:23:14,305
chairs so that they would be in

663
00:23:14,305 --> 00:23:16,885
front it just so funny to be

664
00:23:17,695 --> 00:23:19,675
more chairs are here we'll just take

665
00:23:19,675 --> 00:23:20,185
the picture

666
00:23:22,795 --> 00:23:24,925
oh i don't yeah i don't want

667
00:23:24,925 --> 00:23:25,885
to move my shares they can move

668
00:23:25,885 --> 00:23:27,685
their chairs there they're a million years

669
00:23:27,685 --> 00:23:30,085
old yeah they're a little feeder dangling

670
00:23:30,625 --> 00:23:32,305
service should move there today even the

671
00:23:32,305 --> 00:23:34,495
site even them in their chairs was

672
00:23:34,525 --> 00:23:37,315
seemed proportionally weird yeah yeah there's a

673
00:23:37,315 --> 00:23:38,515
lot going god i pray they're still

674
00:23:38,515 --> 00:23:40,735

to say about it lord no i'm

677
00:23:44,845 --> 00:23:46,825
saying there's nothing negative that's being said

678
00:23:46,825 --> 00:23:49,075
it's just that they have big chairs

679
00:23:49,075 --> 00:23:51,205
and they're small big chairs tiny bodies

680
00:23:51,895 --> 00:23:53,515

having to do the most and it

691
00:24:11,335 --> 00:24:12,985

00:25:55,375 --> 00:25:57,385
fans nowadays and it's better but back

742
00:25:57,385 --> 00:25:58,675
then it was just i'm sure it

743
00:25:58,675 --> 00:25:59,005
was just

744
00:25:59,125 --> 00:26:01,555
brutal so anytime i would be i

745
00:26:01,555 --> 00:26:02,815
would look at my schedule and that's

746
00:26:02,815 --> 00:26:03,955
the other thing they're not even given

747
00:26:03,955 --> 00:26:05,335
you a full time schedule like you

748
00:26:05,395 --> 00:26:06,625
you did and it would be like

749
00:26:06,625 --> 00:26:08,395
fifteen hours that week or something and

750
00:26:08,395 --> 00:26:09,865
you'd have to like go around and

751
00:26:09,865 --> 00:26:11,545
ask people for their shifts and stuff

752
00:26:11,995 --> 00:26:14,155
so but i would hate it when

753
00:26:14,155 --> 00:26:15,175
i would see i was right i

754
00:26:15,175 --> 00:26:16,255

755
00:26:16,255 --> 00:26:17,575
was rare bear on the schedule it

756
00:26:17,575 --> 00:26:18,925

757
00:26:18,925 --> 00:26:19,285

have handlers who are watching you and

770
00:26:43,585 --> 00:26:45,475

823
00:28:31,225 --> 00:28:33,295

00:28:33,295 --> 00:28:34,735
out from behind a corner and scare

00:28:34,735 --> 00:28:36,385
someone and it would use the first

826
00:28:36,385 --> 00:28:36,775
time it would

827
00:28:36,805 --> 00:28:38,455
just be one person they go huh

828
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:41,545
and then laugh and then you you'd

829
00:28:41,545 --> 00:28:43,555
go like shsh to them do the

830
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:47,635
shush sign and then they would watch

831
00:28:47,635 --> 00:28:49,675
you scare another person and by the

832
00:28:49,675 --> 00:28:50,575
end of it by the end of

833
00:28:50,575 --> 00:28:52,255
like ten people a big crowd would

834
00:28:52,255 --> 00:28:55,255
gather there watching you do the same

835
00:28:55,255 --> 00:28:56,875
scare for people you know

836
00:28:56,965 --> 00:28:58,465
that was really fun but the one

837
00:28:58,765 --> 00:29:00,985
at one point my friend who played

838
00:29:00,985 --> 00:29:03,085
breyer fox he said hey come out

839
00:29:03,085 --> 00:29:04,941
here on this balcony i want to

840
00:29:04,941 --> 00:29:07,315
show you something and i went out

841
00:29:07,315 --> 00:29:08,875
on the balcony closed the door behind

842
00:29:08,875 --> 00:29:11,215
me and there's no doorknob on the

843
00:29:11,215 --> 00:29:13,015
door and essentially i was stuck up

844
00:29:13,015 --> 00:29:15,145
there my entire shift waving at people

845
00:29:15,145 --> 00:29:16,253
from the balcony and that's

846
00:29:17,335 --> 00:29:19,045
and that was that i was funny

847
00:29:19,045 --> 00:29:21,325
good actually it was it was preferable

848
00:29:21,325 --> 00:29:23,785
to walking yeah yeah yeah yeah but

849
00:29:23,785 --> 00:29:25,045
the one day that that lauren i

850
00:29:25,045 --> 00:29:26,365
think that the story you're thinking of

851
00:29:26,365 --> 00:29:28,525
is is we used to have essentially

852
00:29:28,525 --> 00:29:31,015
the shifts were ah you do ten

853
00:29:31,015 --> 00:29:32,995
minutes on ten minutes off fifteen minutes

854
00:29:32,995 --> 00:29:34,225
on fifteen minutes off you would never

855
00:29:34,225 --> 00:29:36,265
do more than thirty five minutes that's

856
00:29:36,295 --> 00:29:37,285
not bad yeah

857
00:29:37,285 --> 00:29:38,725
yeah so because it was just brutally

858
00:29:38,725 --> 00:29:40,555
hot out there in california in the

859
00:29:40,555 --> 00:29:42,955
summer in these costumes so thirty five

860
00:29:42,955 --> 00:29:44,335
minutes was the longest you were supposed

861
00:29:44,335 --> 00:29:45,775
to do and what you would usually

862
00:29:45,775 --> 00:29:48,205
do is you'd be backstage and you'd

863
00:29:48,205 --> 00:29:50,575
come out your entrance and exit and

864
00:29:50,575 --> 00:29:52,645
entertain people by that entrance and exit

865
00:29:52,645 --> 00:29:54,145
and then go back the way you

866
00:29:54,145 --> 00:29:56,545
came when you're when your handler would

867
00:29:56,545 --> 00:29:57,445
say okay that's thirty

868
00:29:57,475 --> 00:30:00,085
five minutes but every once in a

869
00:30:00,085 --> 00:30:01,585
while there were these shifts that they

870
00:30:01,585 --> 00:30:03,235
called walk abouts or something where you

871
00:30:03,235 --> 00:30:04,915
had to start at one entrance and

872
00:30:04,915 --> 00:30:07,255
your shift was you would you walking

873
00:30:07,255 --> 00:30:09,535
to another backstage area in a different

874
00:30:09,535 --> 00:30:11,575
land so you would start on main

875
00:30:11,575 --> 00:30:14,275
street and then walk and entertain people

876
00:30:14,275 --> 00:30:15,655
as you were wide tried to catch

877
00:30:15,655 --> 00:30:17,605
a few people that way um because

878
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:20,950
yeah fuse to disneyland i was very

879
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:22,840
dedicated to getting their autograph book signed

880
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:24,310
up they didn't really care that much

881
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:25,150
about it but when i was little

882
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:26,620
i really cared about that and i

883
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:28,000
still have my autograph book when i

884
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,530
was little yeah and so i was

885
00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:31,000
like i want to get anybody we

886
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,040

887
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,600
on a mission to get away from

888
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,370
you basically and i would be i

889
00:30:36,370 --> 00:30:37,870
mean i'm a grown woman chasing them

890
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:38,260

carries of this habits um and you

896
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,170
could have just taken a pen and

897
00:30:50,170 --> 00:30:52,450
signed it goofy know because it's about

898
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:54,070
how they do it individually each one

899
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:56,260

and your handler wouldn't come with you

905
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:06,310
because they were just hanging out by

906
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:09,370
the entrance so the handler would greet

907
00:31:09,370 --> 00:31:10,420

um yeah anyway so that was it

979
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:33,490
so i was i was one that

980
00:33:33,490 --> 00:33:35,320
was probably when i was like fuck

981
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:36,790
this job i don't think i want

982
00:33:36,790 --> 00:33:38,350
to come back to it which was

983
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:40,150
as easy as never calling in to

984
00:33:40,150 --> 00:33:41,980
get your schedule ever i'm sure right

985
00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:44,620
i i what's so funny to me

986
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:47,170
is that you're playing this character that's

987
00:33:47,170 --> 00:33:48,490
from a cancelled movie

988
00:33:48,490 --> 00:33:51,340
a like at that point they it

989
00:33:51,433 --> 00:33:53,290
definitely at that point had been like

990
00:33:53,470 --> 00:33:55,390
they locked that movie away yeah definitely

991
00:33:55,390 --> 00:33:56,770
yeah even though they were still making

992
00:33:56,770 --> 00:33:57,910
splash mountain and all that kind of

993
00:33:57,910 --> 00:33:59,650
stuff yeah so what is the context

994
00:33:59,650 --> 00:34:01,660
for kids when they see breyer bare

995
00:34:01,663 --> 00:34:04,240
like nothing nothing with him you have

996
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,860
no context for that and i i

997
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:07,030
don't think it's like one of those

998
00:34:07,030 --> 00:34:08,470
things where you just go oh yeah

999
00:34:08,470 --> 00:34:08,650
he's

1000
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:10,360
from one of those movies like you

1001
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,380
just like kind of put them in

1002
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:14,530
the robin hood sort of characters i

1003
00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:16,390
am i right um wait i have

1004
00:34:16,390 --> 00:34:17,620
an update on the jet blue guy

1005
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:21,520
he lives between mexico and san diego

1006
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,470
and he had a job at seaworld

1007
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:25,480
as of tonight tears and nineteen oh

1008
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:28,120
no mm okay and did we like

1009
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:28,540
him still

1010
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:30,430
i don't know why you would go

1011
00:34:30,430 --> 00:34:32,260
work at seaworld after that documentary came

1012
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:32,560
out

1013
00:34:34,570 --> 00:34:36,610
maybe because of his prior work they

1014
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:37,630
were like why are you

1015
00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:41,380
you can have two beers every shift

1016
00:34:44,950 --> 00:34:46,240
i also did not like my ways

1017
00:34:46,390 --> 00:34:47,950
oh yeah disneyland at the time would

1018
00:34:48,070 --> 00:34:50,260
would only let you bring two people

1019
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:53,170
into the park per year um in

1020
00:34:53,170 --> 00:34:54,700
my opinion when you were when i

1021
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:56,050
was working there i was like let

1022
00:34:56,050 --> 00:34:58,030
me come back here oh and and

1023
00:34:58,030 --> 00:34:59,020
by the way i would only be

1024
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:00,130
able to come back twice a year

1025
00:35:00,130 --> 00:35:02,050
and just like as a guest i

1026
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:02,650
was like living

1027
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:04,060
in whenever i want a fuck you

1028
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:05,290

1029
00:35:05,290 --> 00:35:07,600
day but the thing is like you

1030
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,220
know what happened is that the employees

1031
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:13,000
would start fraternizing like you go you

1032
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:14,290

so this this touch the ghouls i

1044
00:35:42,070 --> 00:35:42,880
would have just

1045
00:35:42,970 --> 00:35:44,680
quit because this is the summer of

1046
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:46,510
eighty or this is october of nineteen

1047
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:48,790
eighty eight as well back in october

1048
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:52,360
oh hey age so i would adjust

1049
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:54,040
quit that i remember it was eighty

1050
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,360
eight because i had just learned how

1051
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:57,970
to get a good haircut and i

1052
00:35:57,970 --> 00:35:59,259
saw someone from my high school who

1053
00:35:59,259 --> 00:36:00,430
was like fuck

1054
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:06,100
well so my dad my dad cut

1055
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:09,070
my hair my entire life right because

1056
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:10,750
oh okay yeah yeah because he didn't

1057
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:12,580
want to spend money on haircuts and

1058
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:15,190
instead so he bought clipping senses i

1059
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:18,760
need pictures okay i barely have any

1060
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,080
pictures of me by the way growing

1061
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,690
because we didn't have like you know

1062
00:36:22,690 --> 00:36:24,010
phone cameras and so it was like

1063
00:36:24,010 --> 00:36:25,210
a big deal to put film in

1064
00:36:25,210 --> 00:36:28,840
the camera right so so i he

1065
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:30,370
he and he was you know norman

1066
00:36:30,370 --> 00:36:31,870
forces guys so he gave me the

1067
00:36:31,870 --> 00:36:34,090
high and tight you know pretty much

1068
00:36:34,510 --> 00:36:36,340
for wow and then and then growing

1069
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:37,870
up in the seventies and eighties the

1070
00:36:37,870 --> 00:36:41,050
bowl cut was the was yeah

1071
00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:42,910
he basically just put a bowl over

1072
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:44,020
my head and cut around it and

1073
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:47,320
shit a literal balka yeah and that

1074
00:36:47,334 --> 00:36:49,900
sucks and then i also was afraid

1075
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:52,630
of barbers so if if he ever

1076
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:55,060
did take me into a barber then

1077
00:36:55,090 --> 00:36:56,260
i would be very frightened that they

1078
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:57,220
were gonna cut me and all this

1079
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:59,380
kind of stuff so so i think

1080
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:01,210
around maybe sixteen or so i

1081
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:03,520
discovered there like a supercut to open

1082
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:04,750
by my house and i was like

1083
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:05,620
let me so let me see what

1084
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:06,550
this is all about and i went

1085
00:37:06,550 --> 00:37:08,230
in and it was like oh but

1086
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:09,940
i didn't know how how to describe

1087
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:11,530
what i wanted right right but they

1088
00:37:11,530 --> 00:37:13,000
were like just judging by what you're

1089
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,350
going with we know how to fix

1090
00:37:14,350 --> 00:37:16,450
this point but it still was not

1091
00:37:16,450 --> 00:37:17,620
good right so i spent all of

1092
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:19,750
high school with basically precuts and you're

1093
00:37:19,750 --> 00:37:21,370
not great hair and then when i

1094
00:37:21,430 --> 00:37:23,560
turned eighteen and i went to college

1095
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:25,210
my the guy who ended up being

1096
00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:27,430
my best friend cut hair and was

1097
00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:30,850
like oh like yeah why is your

1098
00:37:30,850 --> 00:37:31,870
hair so bad and it was like

1099
00:37:31,870 --> 00:37:33,160
i don't know what to ask for

1100
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:35,477
and why is your hair so bad

1101
00:37:36,790 --> 00:37:38,290
you know what i have to say

1102
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:40,750
um so i listened to

1103
00:37:42,070 --> 00:37:44,290

00:37:49,870 --> 00:37:51,730
about their friend group which includes club

1108
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,680
um but who else is in that

1109
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:56,500
group like danielle schlosser casey wilson

1110
00:37:57,220 --> 00:37:59,560
or kindred one thing i really like

1111
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:01,480
about that group is that it feels

1112
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:03,250
like they're really honest with each other

1113
00:38:03,910 --> 00:38:05,140
like about stuff like that like where

1114
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:06,790
it doesn't really matter but they'll say

1115
00:38:06,790 --> 00:38:08,980
like um jessica is telling a story

1116
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:11,710

1117
00:38:11,710 --> 00:38:13,480

1118
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:14,320
brain on top of her head and

1119
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,220

1127
00:38:28,437 --> 00:38:30,220

1128
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:31,990

looked like erect sugar daddy i also

1146
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:04,960
did not have a decent haircut until

1147
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,910
i was about that age because my

1148
00:39:07,030 --> 00:39:08,920
growing up my aunt cut our hair

1149
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:11,350
next door and she cut all of

1150
00:39:11,350 --> 00:39:13,240
our hair and so there's yeah you

1151
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:14,710
know my school for frozen stuff like

1152
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:17,530
that no charge which you really

1153
00:39:18,010 --> 00:39:21,310
no oh okay um and then i

1154
00:39:21,310 --> 00:39:23,410
went to like a bad barber like

1155
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,990
just a local barber for a while

1156
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:28,090
just like my bad lieutenant of barbers

1157
00:39:28,210 --> 00:39:30,130
yeah yeah yeah yeah no he suppose

1158
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:34,810
yes yeah um and then i visited

1159
00:39:34,810 --> 00:39:37,210
my sister who lived in los angeles

1160
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:37,930
in nineteen eighty

1161
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:40,360
for wow and she took me to

1162
00:39:40,529 --> 00:39:43,090
a shortcut what sushi

1163
00:39:44,290 --> 00:39:45,790
sushi so that was very bad in

1164
00:39:45,790 --> 00:39:48,040
the los angeles news is that something

1165
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:49,810
you had when you went there it

1166
00:39:49,810 --> 00:39:51,850
was not no i was just helped

1167
00:39:51,850 --> 00:39:53,260
to be cool like i think getting

1168
00:39:53,356 --> 00:39:55,180
your kind of vacation in a cool

1169
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:57,190
city is such a good idea did

1170
00:39:57,190 --> 00:39:59,590
she teach you to believe what my

1171
00:39:59,590 --> 00:40:01,450
hair looked like afterwards i was like

1172
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:04,330
oh my this is but see it

1173
00:40:04,330 --> 00:40:05,410
it was it was amazed it was

1174
00:40:05,410 --> 00:40:07,300
a revelation to me here's my here's

1175
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:09,040
the thing i feel like it's easier

1176
00:40:09,070 --> 00:40:10,420
well it depends on who you are

1177
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:12,610
in your whole vibe i'm paul i

1178
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,560
ok well knowing your whole vibe is

1179
00:40:15,490 --> 00:40:17,710
but i think reserved judgement you'll be

1180
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:19,660
able to maintain like you'd be able

1181
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:21,850
to make it look the same or

1182
00:40:21,850 --> 00:40:24,490
get maintain the style yeah i

1183
00:40:25,125 --> 00:40:27,165
yeah it's in high school and they

1184
00:40:27,169 --> 00:40:28,455
look good when the person did it

1185
00:40:28,455 --> 00:40:29,805
and then i just would make no

1186
00:40:29,805 --> 00:40:32,655
effort to brush my hair put anything

1187
00:40:32,655 --> 00:40:33,675
in it i didn't know how to

1188
00:40:33,675 --> 00:40:35,955
blow dry it right or something and

1189
00:40:35,955 --> 00:40:37,635
so it just was like whatever all

1190
00:40:37,635 --> 00:40:40,065
the time and i feel like that's

1191
00:40:40,065 --> 00:40:41,265
part of the problem it's like i

1192
00:40:41,295 --> 00:40:43,065
could get a good haircut i had

1193
00:40:43,065 --> 00:40:45,222
the resources but i didn't care

1194
00:40:45,285 --> 00:40:47,805
or know how to maintain it yeah

1195
00:40:48,255 --> 00:40:49,965
but when your parents trying to help

1196
00:40:49,965 --> 00:40:51,225
you with that that i feel like

1197
00:40:51,225 --> 00:40:54,885
my parents basically gave up and never

1198
00:40:55,365 --> 00:40:58,965
never were like not never thought any

1199
00:40:59,055 --> 00:41:01,335
thing like that was important to me

1200
00:41:01,335 --> 00:41:02,865
even though it is important like your

1201
00:41:03,225 --> 00:41:04,725
yeah no my mom my mom shared

1202
00:41:04,725 --> 00:41:05,385
about all

1203
00:41:05,895 --> 00:41:06,975
she would be like why don't you

1204
00:41:06,975 --> 00:41:08,007
brush your hair that i'd be like

1205
00:41:08,025 --> 00:41:08,805
dough or whatever

1206
00:41:10,095 --> 00:41:12,525
oh my oh did teach me how

1207
00:41:12,525 --> 00:41:14,205
to do my makeup and stuff and

1208
00:41:14,235 --> 00:41:15,540
that was good and so i mean

1209
00:41:15,555 --> 00:41:16,605
i you know i'm sure i was

1210
00:41:16,605 --> 00:41:18,765
fine just i was more like casual

1211
00:41:18,765 --> 00:41:20,865
you know i didn't really care um

1212
00:41:21,075 --> 00:41:22,875
but i also see like these girls

1213
00:41:22,875 --> 00:41:23,865
now and i mean there are always

1214
00:41:23,865 --> 00:41:25,065
people like this like they're were always

1215
00:41:25,065 --> 00:41:26,685
like those girls who like had everything

1216
00:41:26,685 --> 00:41:28,755
put together and they looked like cool

1217
00:41:28,995 --> 00:41:30,061
but like it feels like

1218
00:41:30,195 --> 00:41:32,895
now it's like maybe because of social

1219
00:41:32,895 --> 00:41:35,415
media you have more pizza like to

1220
00:41:35,415 --> 00:41:37,215
look at and it's like youtube makeup

1221
00:41:37,215 --> 00:41:38,715

1222
00:41:38,715 --> 00:41:40,185

makeup and like anyone has that too

1225
00:41:44,235 --> 00:41:45,495
available to them which is kind of

1226
00:41:45,525 --> 00:41:47,715
amazing know today that's what i'm better

1227
00:41:47,715 --> 00:41:49,095
things about the internet yeah but don't

1228
00:41:49,095 --> 00:41:50,325
you think that then all the

1229
00:41:50,355 --> 00:41:52,065
kids look so cool now that you're

1230
00:41:52,065 --> 00:41:55,245
like this seems wrong i'm not looking

1231
00:41:55,245 --> 00:41:56,175
at them so i have no idea

1232
00:41:56,175 --> 00:41:58,245
okay well it feels that way she's

1233
00:41:58,245 --> 00:42:00,615
got that kids all seem like really

1234
00:42:00,615 --> 00:42:02,865
put together and i'm like where are

1235
00:42:02,865 --> 00:42:04,575
the kids who like are dorks like

1236
00:42:04,575 --> 00:42:06,015
i guess they're not posting on social

1237
00:42:06,015 --> 00:42:07,395
media in that way it is always

1238
00:42:07,395 --> 00:42:08,295
weird to me and you see it

1239
00:42:08,295 --> 00:42:09,615
a lot in l a because you

1240
00:42:09,675 --> 00:42:10,485
you know

1241
00:42:10,485 --> 00:42:13,215
know people who are rich and they

1242
00:42:13,245 --> 00:42:15,165
the way they style their own kids

1243
00:42:15,165 --> 00:42:16,245
yeah it was like you see like

1244
00:42:16,245 --> 00:42:18,615

1245
00:42:18,615 --> 00:42:20,925

like a super expensive looking clothes and

1249
00:42:28,245 --> 00:42:30,255
it's like this seems abnormal to me

1250
00:42:30,315 --> 00:42:30,645
i was

1251
00:42:30,705 --> 00:42:32,655
the one strange one thing i have

1252
00:42:32,655 --> 00:42:34,725
been doing recently is watching i've become

1253
00:42:34,725 --> 00:42:39,195
fascinated with instagram videos from like virtuoso

1254
00:42:39,195 --> 00:42:42,675
kids playing electric guitar or maisy and

1255
00:42:42,675 --> 00:42:45,105
doing like incredible metallica solos and stuff

1256
00:42:45,105 --> 00:42:47,115
like that and i was looking at

1257
00:42:47,115 --> 00:42:49,335
one yesterday with this like i couldn't

1258
00:42:49,335 --> 00:42:50,535
quite tell how old he was but

1259
00:42:50,535 --> 00:42:50,805
then

1260
00:42:50,895 --> 00:42:52,005
when there was a full body he

1261
00:42:52,005 --> 00:42:53,265
was like super short so i was

1262
00:42:53,265 --> 00:42:54,525
like is this kid like ten or

1263
00:42:54,525 --> 00:42:56,085
something like that but he had the

1264
00:42:56,085 --> 00:42:59,325
fucking coolest haircut and was wearing cool

1265
00:42:59,325 --> 00:43:01,365
clothes and shredding on the guitar and

1266
00:43:01,365 --> 00:43:03,585
i'm just like who taught him all

1267
00:43:03,585 --> 00:43:05,355
this i thought the six year old

1268
00:43:05,355 --> 00:43:08,325
girl in australia who's a skateboarder and

1269
00:43:08,325 --> 00:43:10,965
she's like amazing and she does like

1270
00:43:10,995 --> 00:43:14,655
fucking full-on moves like you know slipping

1271
00:43:14,655 --> 00:43:16,125
out and cut fine back into the

1272
00:43:16,425 --> 00:43:17,655
bowl or whatever the hell it's called

1273
00:43:18,045 --> 00:43:20,501
and she's amazing and i'm like what

1274
00:43:20,505 --> 00:43:22,395
that what is that about like how

1275
00:43:22,425 --> 00:43:24,705
do you yeah well yeah there's no

1276
00:43:24,735 --> 00:43:27,165
factories being prodigy is one thing but

1277
00:43:27,195 --> 00:43:29,205
the who who then on top of

1278
00:43:29,205 --> 00:43:30,465
it teaches them how to have cool

1279
00:43:30,465 --> 00:43:30,885
t-shirts

00:43:31,155 --> 00:43:33,405
drugs cool and i mean she's six

1281
00:43:33,585 --> 00:43:35,775
and she's obviously her but maybe your

1282
00:43:35,775 --> 00:43:38,055
parents have to be really especially for

1283
00:43:38,055 --> 00:43:39,375
something like that where it's really risky

1284
00:43:39,375 --> 00:43:41,295
like doing skateboarding stuff like you have

1285
00:43:41,295 --> 00:43:42,705
to be really chill to like let

1286
00:43:42,705 --> 00:43:44,175
your kid fly in and out of

1287
00:43:44,175 --> 00:43:46,065

it's the

1344
00:45:43,665 --> 00:45:47,323
funniest thing ever it's like it's like

1345
00:45:47,595 --> 00:45:49,695
need to see that it's so loving

1346
00:45:49,725 --> 00:45:51,855
give them masks or anything or is

1347
00:45:51,885 --> 00:45:53,145
nil what they're like so walk up

1348
00:45:53,145 --> 00:45:54,795
to this axe on the floor and

1349
00:45:54,795 --> 00:45:56,205

00:45:57,735 --> 00:46:00,525
it's ah it's so good and some

1351
00:46:00,525 --> 00:46:02,655
people take like really seriously

1352
00:46:03,615 --> 00:46:05,475
it's it's just bizarre i love it

1353
00:46:05,475 --> 00:46:06,855
so much i don't know why i

1354
00:46:06,855 --> 00:46:07,845
didn't get the job to be a

1355
00:46:07,845 --> 00:46:10,695
monster unless i was too i mean

1356
00:46:10,695 --> 00:46:12,345
it seems like because my my best

1357
00:46:12,345 --> 00:46:14,025
friend got to be a monster so

1358
00:46:14,025 --> 00:46:16,815
it was very bizarre that unless unless

1359
00:46:16,815 --> 00:46:17,925
he got the job as a monster

1360
00:46:17,925 --> 00:46:19,005
i was like hey they're still looking

1361
00:46:19,005 --> 00:46:20,325
for people then by the time i

1362
00:46:20,325 --> 00:46:22,065
applied they were like we only need

1363
00:46:22,065 --> 00:46:23,445
security people at this point but

1364
00:46:23,715 --> 00:46:25,395
you probably just had that bear bear

1365
00:46:25,395 --> 00:46:28,575
energies yeah probably probably just to you

1366
00:46:28,575 --> 00:46:30,555
so that they were like you could

1367
00:46:30,555 --> 00:46:33,465
do security actually maybe they heard about

1368
00:46:33,465 --> 00:46:35,595
you from disneyland like this guy's gonna

1369
00:46:35,595 --> 00:46:36,765
get lost if you've got a mascot

1370
00:46:37,095 --> 00:46:39,585
yeah well so my friend he were

1371
00:46:39,615 --> 00:46:41,205
he was a monster and kingdom of

1372
00:46:41,205 --> 00:46:43,335
the dinosaurs which was an old ride

1373
00:46:43,875 --> 00:46:46,365
um at knott's berry farm and um

1374
00:46:46,635 --> 00:46:49,215
so he was watching what monster was

1375
00:46:49,215 --> 00:46:51,482
he at kingdom of the dinosaurs well

1376
00:46:52,185 --> 00:46:54,135
a kingdom of the dinosaur every ride

1377
00:46:54,135 --> 00:46:57,195
was obscured to and made halloween fide

1378
00:46:57,195 --> 00:46:59,115
so it wasn't kingdom of the dinosaurs

1379
00:46:59,115 --> 00:47:01,005
during halloween haunt but that was the

1380
00:47:01,305 --> 00:47:03,855
what why i don't know

1381
00:47:04,035 --> 00:47:05,295
like witch hats on the dinosaur

1382
00:47:08,655 --> 00:47:09,585
they had to share one

1383
00:47:10,785 --> 00:47:13,785
just pass it around um so he

1384
00:47:13,785 --> 00:47:15,345
was a monster in kingdom of the

1385
00:47:15,345 --> 00:47:18,045
dinosaurs and i was lying security in

1386
00:47:18,045 --> 00:47:19,995
front of kingdom of the dinosaurs where

1387
00:47:19,995 --> 00:47:21,855
i would basically like essentially i would

1388
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:24,075
like lit in the hot people essentially

1389
00:47:24,075 --> 00:47:26,535
halloween haunt is just people trying to

1390
00:47:26,535 --> 00:47:29,487
zero guys any girls here oh yeah

1391
00:47:30,225 --> 00:47:30,885
i mean more lady

1392
00:47:30,885 --> 00:47:34,395
isn't there cyber honestly paul it is

1393
00:47:34,395 --> 00:47:35,655
not that far off from that but

1394
00:47:35,685 --> 00:47:38,415
it it it started as because everyone

1395
00:47:38,415 --> 00:47:40,155
just wants to cut the line constantly

1396
00:47:40,185 --> 00:47:41,565
and so it was lovely so you're

1397
00:47:41,565 --> 00:47:43,485
constantly just going like hey you know

1398
00:47:43,485 --> 00:47:44,655
when people coming up to you going

1399
00:47:44,655 --> 00:47:46,515
they behind me they were they they

1400
00:47:46,515 --> 00:47:47,985
just walked into the line and you

1401
00:47:47,985 --> 00:47:49,215
have to go over an arcs and

1402
00:47:49,215 --> 00:47:50,655
go like get out of here you

1403
00:47:50,655 --> 00:47:50,895
know

1404
00:47:51,555 --> 00:47:53,355
um so that's that's basically all i

1405
00:47:53,355 --> 00:47:55,215
did during halloween haunt but my friend

1406
00:47:55,215 --> 00:47:57,195
was working as a as a monster

1407
00:47:57,195 --> 00:47:58,770
inside the ride that i was working

1408
00:47:58,829 --> 00:47:59,985
so what he would do and he's

1409
00:47:59,985 --> 00:48:02,565
like this inkster he was this incredibly

1410
00:48:02,565 --> 00:48:06,915
good-looking guy right um well sure and

1411
00:48:06,975 --> 00:48:10,095
um so he would basically what would

1412
00:48:10,095 --> 00:48:10,875
happen is is

1413
00:48:11,205 --> 00:48:13,035
if a car would come through with

1414
00:48:13,035 --> 00:48:17,025
hot women who are our age he

1415
00:48:17,025 --> 00:48:19,875
would take off his mask to show

1416
00:48:19,875 --> 00:48:20,955
that he was handsome

1417
00:48:22,005 --> 00:48:25,875
jump in their car and then wash

1418
00:48:26,175 --> 00:48:28,335
chat them up whichever one he was

1419
00:48:28,335 --> 00:48:31,065
interested in and say hey let's go

1420
00:48:31,065 --> 00:48:34,546
out my friend scott is working as

1421
00:48:34,546 --> 00:48:36,675
us as a line security guard out

1422
00:48:36,675 --> 00:48:37,845
at the front of the ride so

1423
00:48:37,845 --> 00:48:40,215
go give give your number to him

1424
00:48:40,215 --> 00:48:41,295
and he'll pass it on to me

1425
00:48:42,375 --> 00:48:45,225
what that was his system i don't

1426
00:48:45,225 --> 00:48:46,665
know why i acquiesce to it because

1427
00:48:46,665 --> 00:48:48,705
i'd never benefited from it i the

1428
00:48:48,705 --> 00:48:50,985
one time that he ever asked me

1429
00:48:50,985 --> 00:48:51,825
if i wanted to go on a

1430
00:48:51,825 --> 00:48:54,435
double date i went to his apartment

1431
00:48:54,465 --> 00:48:58,005
and um the two girls arrived and

1432
00:48:58,005 --> 00:48:59,325
we sat down we talked for a

1433
00:48:59,325 --> 00:49:01,395
while and then he said ok let's

1434
00:49:01,395 --> 00:49:02,325
go when i stood up

1435
00:49:02,385 --> 00:49:03,615
and the girl who is supposed to

1436
00:49:03,615 --> 00:49:04,575
be on the day with me looked

1437
00:49:04,575 --> 00:49:05,625
at me and said oh you're coming

1438
00:49:05,625 --> 00:49:08,175
too so that was ah

1439
00:49:08,565 --> 00:49:11,415
oh wow she thought she was on

1440
00:49:11,415 --> 00:49:13,215
a double date with her friend and

1441
00:49:13,215 --> 00:49:15,615
this guy hoping to threesome with this

1442
00:49:15,675 --> 00:49:17,625
really good looking guy probably is my

1443
00:49:17,625 --> 00:49:19,095
friend arthur funds really

1444
00:49:20,325 --> 00:49:21,465
maybe she thought she would just win

1445
00:49:21,465 --> 00:49:21,765
out

1446
00:49:22,995 --> 00:49:25,785
so right yeah look at a dish

1447
00:49:26,175 --> 00:49:28,695
so so i would basically be fielding

1448
00:49:29,025 --> 00:49:31,125
um dates for him i do remember

1449
00:49:31,125 --> 00:49:32,745
he he had a vesper scooter he

1450
00:49:32,775 --> 00:49:34,845
had a cool like modx vesper scooter

1451
00:49:34,845 --> 00:49:36,045
and got some pretty cool i gotta

1452
00:49:36,045 --> 00:49:38,295
say he ah i'm jealous one time

1453
00:49:38,295 --> 00:49:39,375
he had a date wouldn't give him

1454
00:49:39,375 --> 00:49:39,795

1455
00:49:41,655 --> 00:49:44,115
chicago no um he's a lawyer in

1456
00:49:44,115 --> 00:49:45,555
chicago but he had a cool wsba

1457
00:49:45,555 --> 00:49:47,535
scooter and one time that was tough

1458
00:49:47,835 --> 00:49:49,905
like the the girl that he asked

1459
00:49:49,965 --> 00:49:52,395
out lived an hour away by off

1460
00:49:52,395 --> 00:49:53,625
the four or five freeway and so

1461
00:49:53,625 --> 00:49:55,395
he needed me to drive him because

1462
00:49:55,395 --> 00:49:56,625
that was too dangerous to take the

1463
00:49:56,625 --> 00:49:58,485
scooter on so i drove him in

1464
00:49:58,485 --> 00:50:00,525
sat there while i he took the

1465
00:50:00,525 --> 00:50:01,095
girl into the

1466
00:50:01,125 --> 00:50:03,735
bedroom and i just watched i remember

1467
00:50:03,735 --> 00:50:06,158
watching the bangles walk like an egyptian

in all black they assumed you were

1522
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:55,380
a monster the employee entrance and they

1523
00:51:55,380 --> 00:51:57,330
would just not check anything and just

1524
00:51:57,330 --> 00:51:58,560
let you through you know what do

1525
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:01,043
you mean you found that entrance was

1526
00:52:01,043 --> 00:52:02,490
wearing that for a job

1527
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:04,386
yeah but you had but use you

1528
00:52:04,386 --> 00:52:06,000
you were supposed to show that you

1529
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,340
were working there ron you know and

1530
00:52:08,340 --> 00:52:09,720
that one there was a specific entrance

1531
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:10,980
where you could just walk in it

1532
00:52:10,980 --> 00:52:12,360
looked like you already had checked yes

1533
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:13,980
anytime he went right through the park

1534
00:52:13,980 --> 00:52:15,090
you had dish but there was a

1535
00:52:15,090 --> 00:52:16,680
specific entrance where it was just if

1536
00:52:16,680 --> 00:52:18,000
you dressed all in black they assumed

1537
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,020
you were a monster and so you

1538
00:52:19,020 --> 00:52:21,180
just walked right in and so we

1539
00:52:21,180 --> 00:52:22,530
just hung out there all night and

1540
00:52:22,530 --> 00:52:22,650
i

1541
00:52:22,650 --> 00:52:24,840
was just so i didn't want to

1542
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:26,640
go by kingdom of the dinosaurs because

1543
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:28,020
i didn't want my supervisor to see

1544
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:29,917
me of course not but i mean

1545
00:52:30,037 --> 00:52:31,290
obviously yeah i think

1546
00:52:33,210 --> 00:52:35,220
there was a story um that josh

1547
00:52:35,250 --> 00:52:38,580
melina the actor told about he was

1548
00:52:38,580 --> 00:52:40,350
in a few good men on broadway

1549
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:44,190
and when the big bang theory that's

1550
00:52:44,190 --> 00:52:47,790
right yes and ah ken marino was

1551
00:52:47,790 --> 00:52:51,210
his understudy in that play and so

1552
00:52:51,210 --> 00:52:52,650
the run was like you know

1553
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:54,540
it's very successful show and ran for

1554
00:52:54,540 --> 00:52:58,410
a long time and so um josh

1555
00:52:58,950 --> 00:53:01,320
ah wanted to let i think it

1556
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:02,400
was like coming to a close or

1557
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:04,590
something and josh wanted to let can

1558
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:05,790
get a chance to go on stage

1559
00:53:05,820 --> 00:53:07,170
that's nice so he told him i'll

1560
00:53:07,170 --> 00:53:08,340
call out sick and so you can

1561
00:53:08,340 --> 00:53:11,550
go on but then josh went to

1562
00:53:11,550 --> 00:53:12,780
the play to watch

1563
00:53:12,810 --> 00:53:15,150

00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:18,510
because he wanted to see how he

1566
00:53:18,510 --> 00:53:21,000

00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:24,240

1574
00:53:37,290 --> 00:53:38,850
i've been in some states but i

1575
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:40,830
truly hate them i hate watching i

1576
00:53:40,830 --> 00:53:42,690
was thinking about them how i used

1577
00:53:42,690 --> 00:53:44,130
to be so mad in my old

1578
00:53:44,130 --> 00:53:46,110
apartment whenever a leaf blower would wake

1579
00:53:46,110 --> 00:53:48,960
me up and i would i would

1580
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:50,670
just be banging the window like it

1581
00:53:50,670 --> 00:53:52,080
has to be illegal to do this

1582
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:53,550
before ten a m ten am was

1583
00:53:53,550 --> 00:53:54,810
my cutoff at the time but it's

1584
00:53:54,810 --> 00:53:56,460
like yes it's because it's so bad

1585
00:53:56,460 --> 00:53:57,420
for the environment

1586
00:53:57,450 --> 00:53:59,640
it actually like produces so much gas

1587
00:53:59,850 --> 00:54:01,230
and then they just blow the dirt

1588
00:54:01,230 --> 00:54:03,510
around and then they halftime you just

1589
00:54:03,510 --> 00:54:04,560
see them put it into a pile

1590
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:05,520
and don't do anything with it it's

1591
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:07,350
like what is this why are you

1592
00:54:07,350 --> 00:54:09,270
moving piles of leaves from one area

1593
00:54:09,270 --> 00:54:11,700
to another what have we become dirt

1594
00:54:11,730 --> 00:54:12,390
don't hurt

1595
00:54:13,530 --> 00:54:14,640
just let it build up a little

1596
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:16,020
bit actually um

1597
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:20,010
i had a neighbor incident happen whoa

1598
00:54:20,010 --> 00:54:22,680
okay so we're talking by the way

1599
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:23,760
with the reason i brought up my

1600
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:26,610
neighbor incident before i never got to

1601
00:54:26,610 --> 00:54:28,590
i think was basically i i think

1602
00:54:28,590 --> 00:54:29,670
it was the result of you guys

1603
00:54:29,670 --> 00:54:31,770
shouting in my backyard for months anyway

1604
00:54:31,770 --> 00:54:33,780
go ahead you think that's why they

1605
00:54:33,780 --> 00:54:36,300
were mean to you yes you you

1606
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:37,290
guys shout

1607
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:39,060
yeah my backyard yeah i want to

1608
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:40,290
put the blame but we would do

1609
00:54:40,290 --> 00:54:42,990
it once a week every once in

1610
00:54:42,990 --> 00:54:45,060
a while it wasn't like xy mud

1611
00:54:45,090 --> 00:54:46,740
but it's your fault okay whatever okay

1612
00:54:46,740 --> 00:54:50,400
what's your neighbors okay so um basically

1613
00:54:50,730 --> 00:54:53,130
because of the pandemic there you know

1614
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:56,460
ah we don't drive that much or

1615
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:57,090
fifty five

1616
00:54:57,480 --> 00:54:59,490
there's a car that we have that

1617
00:54:59,490 --> 00:55:02,220
we left on a street that this

1618
00:55:02,220 --> 00:55:04,080
is not doing think it's one cycle

1619
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:07,620
in it's truly fine i haven't thought

1620
00:55:07,620 --> 00:55:09,270
about it much at all am

1621
00:55:10,950 --> 00:55:12,300
then the other day or this was

1622
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:14,550
like a week ago now i was

1623
00:55:14,550 --> 00:55:16,380
walking to my car which is parked

1624
00:55:16,410 --> 00:55:18,180
in a different location and i pass

1625
00:55:18,180 --> 00:55:19,590
by that car and then i was

1626
00:55:19,590 --> 00:55:20,820
like oh there's a piece of paper

1627
00:55:20,820 --> 00:55:22,860
on it so i went over and

1628
00:55:22,860 --> 00:55:24,900
got the piece of paper and it

1629
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:29,850
said hey bitch d dear asshole yeah

1630
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:32,010
by the way this is a street

1631
00:55:32,010 --> 00:55:34,140
where there's no restrictions there's no reason

1632
00:55:34,140 --> 00:55:36,060
for this to be an issue there's

1633
00:55:36,060 --> 00:55:39,240
plenty of space it's although it is

1634
00:55:39,270 --> 00:55:40,860
illegal to leave your car parked in

1635
00:55:40,860 --> 00:55:41,880
one place for

1636
00:55:43,050 --> 00:55:44,160
i forgot what the period of time

1637
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:45,823
is but well okay but i it

1638
00:55:45,900 --> 00:55:47,400
didn't seem like it's actually an issue

1639
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:49,590
because right there's plenty of parking everywhere

1640
00:55:49,590 --> 00:55:51,240
why would we have moved data just

1641
00:55:51,510 --> 00:55:52,950
it doesn't we don't take it that

1642
00:55:52,950 --> 00:55:54,720
often or anything so whatever right but

1643
00:55:56,010 --> 00:55:59,550
um then there's the notes like please

1644
00:55:59,550 --> 00:56:02,610

1647
00:56:08,820 --> 00:56:11,340
and then it said um your car

1648
00:56:11,340 --> 00:56:12,750

for twenty and the note was left

1666
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:51,450
on for eighteen so i moved the

1667
00:56:51,450 --> 00:56:53,728
car instantly and i was like i'll

1668
00:56:53,728 --> 00:56:55,620
literally never park there again whatever it's

1669
00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:55,800
fine

1670
00:56:57,060 --> 00:57:00,090
within a day she had and this

1671
00:57:00,090 --> 00:57:01,740
woman by the way is kind of

1672
00:57:01,740 --> 00:57:03,300
notorious already we're already having a lot

1673
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:05,940
of back and forth about various things

1674
00:57:05,940 --> 00:57:07,710
that i'm like very confused by um

1675
00:57:07,710 --> 00:57:11,310
but she had cleaned the front with

1676
00:57:11,310 --> 00:57:13,530
there's like a small pile of leaves

1677
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:15,720
where the car was i guess there's

1678
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:16,410
really bothering her

1679
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:18,780
she moved her car into the spot

1680
00:57:18,780 --> 00:57:20,580
and then put two green trash cans

1681
00:57:20,580 --> 00:57:22,530
to block anyone from parking behind her

1682
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:25,590
oh lot of that i hate i

1683
00:57:25,590 --> 00:57:26,880

1684
00:57:26,910 --> 00:57:29,220
pettiness is she just wanted her parking

1685
00:57:29,220 --> 00:57:31,860
spot back and she's using hey yeah

1686
00:57:31,860 --> 00:57:33,750

car sitting there but there are other

1691
00:57:41,730 --> 00:57:42,900

1692
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:44,220
time like there's a car on my

1693
00:57:44,220 --> 00:57:45,540

00:57:48,090 --> 00:57:50,160
like i mean i'm very very very

1696
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:52,410

the same note on her car and

1698
00:57:53,940 --> 00:57:56,374

1821
01:01:46,941 --> 01:01:48,025
not like she seems like a hoarder

1825
01:01:53,635 --> 01:01:54,745

one person who is constantly involved in

01:02:18,835 --> 01:02:21,385
drama in the neighborhood yeah it was

1840
01:02:21,415 --> 01:02:22,795

1851
01:02:44,095 --> 01:02:45,595
of her brain onto the urge

1852
01:02:47,485 --> 01:02:48,115
no

1853
01:02:49,555 --> 01:02:51,355
murray's not a poor lady she like

1854
01:02:51,355 --> 01:02:54,475
intentionally vandalized our other neighbors car and

1855
01:02:54,475 --> 01:02:56,185
she got into like screaming that she

1856
01:02:56,185 --> 01:02:58,255
was insane but oh wow well yeah

1857
01:02:58,255 --> 01:03:00,655
that's what i mean like that's so

1858
01:03:00,655 --> 01:03:02,365
unfortunate what a shame it is to

1859
01:03:02,365 --> 01:03:04,735
lose one's mind sure of course but

1860
01:03:04,765 --> 01:03:06,625
well if anyway if one loses one's

1861
01:03:06,625 --> 01:03:08,935
mind i hope you would come out

1862
01:03:08,935 --> 01:03:09,415
on the

1863
01:03:09,445 --> 01:03:11,605
ah the spectrum of being happy all

1864
01:03:11,605 --> 01:03:13,615
the time instead of being that the

1865
01:03:13,615 --> 01:03:16,331
ideal isn't it i love that that

1866
01:03:16,342 --> 01:03:18,085
happens as often as you'd like and

1867
01:03:18,085 --> 01:03:20,425
for that i i will just say

1868
01:03:20,455 --> 01:03:21,595
one last thing about her is that

1869
01:03:21,595 --> 01:03:22,820
now that i'm aware that this is

1870
01:03:22,825 --> 01:03:24,145
a thing i'm trying to count the

1871
01:03:24,145 --> 01:03:26,515
dogs so i'm like okay every jimmy

1872
01:03:26,815 --> 01:03:29,209
currently with a dog i'm counting on

1873
01:03:29,209 --> 01:03:29,575
my dog

1874
01:03:30,055 --> 01:03:31,975
i just want to know and then

1875
01:03:32,035 --> 01:03:33,985
my other friend was like she probably

1876
01:03:33,985 --> 01:03:35,455
has nine dogs that are in there

1877
01:03:35,485 --> 01:03:37,713
at all times like because it's like

1878
01:03:38,665 --> 01:03:40,825
she framed it like why would they

1879
01:03:40,825 --> 01:03:43,135
call on my three dogs when yeah

1880
01:03:43,135 --> 01:03:45,085
so anytime anyone anytime anyone has a

1881
01:03:45,085 --> 01:03:47,695
framing it's always three times worse well

1882
01:03:47,815 --> 01:03:49,105
you know it's like she's setting it

1883
01:03:49,105 --> 01:03:49,735
up to go like there

1884
01:03:49,735 --> 01:03:51,205
is no reason it's only three it's

1885
01:03:51,205 --> 01:03:52,885
like new year like i parked there

1886
01:03:52,885 --> 01:03:54,505
for two weeks yeah you were parked

1887
01:03:54,505 --> 01:03:56,275
there six weeks yeah yeah i mean

1888
01:03:56,305 --> 01:03:58,165
yeah that's that's that's probably true because

1889
01:03:58,165 --> 01:03:59,965
i think i don't know how long

1890
01:03:59,965 --> 01:04:01,315
the car had been sitting there and

1891
01:04:01,315 --> 01:04:03,955
i don't care but i mean yeah

1892
01:04:03,955 --> 01:04:05,575
i'll literally never do that again i

1893
01:04:05,575 --> 01:04:06,715
don't i don't want to have these

1894
01:04:06,715 --> 01:04:08,965
sort of interactions you know my dad

1895
01:04:08,965 --> 01:04:09,821
used to get really

1896
01:04:09,895 --> 01:04:13,525
mad at me for parking um and

1897
01:04:13,525 --> 01:04:15,145
and this is something that he this

1898
01:04:15,145 --> 01:04:17,095
is another in a series of like

1899
01:04:17,095 --> 01:04:18,865
getting mad at me for something that

1900
01:04:18,865 --> 01:04:20,335
he never told me was a thing

1901
01:04:20,785 --> 01:04:23,215
like right right but but when i

1902
01:04:23,215 --> 01:04:24,655
started driving he would get mad if

1903
01:04:24,655 --> 01:04:26,395
i wouldn't if i would sort of

1904
01:04:26,395 --> 01:04:27,955
park where there was not a car

1905
01:04:27,955 --> 01:04:29,965
length behind me

1906
01:04:30,085 --> 01:04:32,695
up to the driveway because he's like

1907
01:04:32,725 --> 01:04:34,765
now only two cars can fit in

1908
01:04:34,765 --> 01:04:36,445
where three cars used to and he

1909
01:04:36,445 --> 01:04:38,995
was like really upset with me about

1910
01:04:38,995 --> 01:04:41,065
it and in getting really mad instead

1911
01:04:41,065 --> 01:04:42,055
of just going like oh hey by

1912
01:04:42,055 --> 01:04:43,225
the way this would be a polite

1913
01:04:43,225 --> 01:04:44,755
thing for yeah it's just like why

1914
01:04:44,755 --> 01:04:46,615
are you parking you're always parking this

1915
01:04:46,615 --> 01:04:49,045
way like i don't know i'd never

1916
01:04:49,045 --> 01:04:50,215
thought about it before like oh

1917
01:04:50,215 --> 01:04:51,745
oh yeah i guess that that is

1918
01:04:51,775 --> 01:04:52,915
like more of a polite thing to

1919
01:04:52,915 --> 01:04:54,865
do yeah but now i think of

1920
01:04:54,895 --> 01:04:57,265
every time i park anywhere sure well

1921
01:04:57,265 --> 01:04:59,875
we're yelling got results well um a

1922
01:04:59,875 --> 01:05:01,045
way to make a dog behave is

1923
01:05:01,045 --> 01:05:04,045
debated i think we talked about this

1924
01:05:04,075 --> 01:05:06,895
old arm expression on our group thread

1925
01:05:06,985 --> 01:05:09,745
is that an actual expression yeah yeah

1926
01:05:10,435 --> 01:05:12,230
um and i feel like it's not

1927
01:05:12,230 --> 01:05:13,435
an expression that seems to be just

1928
01:05:13,435 --> 01:05:16,645
like a belief system yeah

1929
01:05:18,715 --> 01:05:20,905
it doesn't like mean something else yeah

1930
01:05:21,415 --> 01:05:24,295
yeah yeah it's not a colloquialism it's

1931
01:05:24,295 --> 01:05:25,645
like well you know what they say

1932
01:05:25,645 --> 01:05:26,725
if you come into my house i'll

1933
01:05:26,725 --> 01:05:29,215
punch you in the fucking face real

1934
01:05:29,275 --> 01:05:31,585
e ticket ride with those dogs um

1935
01:05:31,645 --> 01:05:33,595
i think we mentioned this on the

1936
01:05:33,715 --> 01:05:37,015
group our groups judge the text thread

1937
01:05:37,375 --> 01:05:37,889
and

1938
01:05:37,975 --> 01:05:39,205
janie and i talked about it on

1939
01:05:39,235 --> 01:05:41,305
our podcast but i was the victim

1940
01:05:41,305 --> 01:05:43,195

the same thing over and over again

1960
01:06:31,075 --> 01:06:33,835
in a condescending way like he was

not calling me a liar but he

1962
01:06:35,155 --> 01:06:36,805

and it escalates to the point where

1973
01:06:56,125 --> 01:06:58,345
he's like he's he says like why

1974
01:06:58,345 --> 01:07:01,645

dogs that are barking and i said

1993
01:07:35,515 --> 01:07:38,155
that the neighbor's dogs and he says

and this to me is the is

1999
01:07:51,025 --> 01:07:53,575
the it's a very amateurish prank call

2000
01:07:53,575 --> 01:07:55,315
because if there were no peaks and

2001
01:07:55,315 --> 01:07:57,475
valleys to it really and the guy

2002
01:07:57,475 --> 01:07:59,875
had a perfect ending and then he

2003
01:07:59,875 --> 01:08:01,795
called back like the perfect ending was

2004
01:08:01,795 --> 01:08:04,615
oh maybe it was those yeah so

2005
01:08:04,615 --> 01:08:05,755
so he called back and i'm like

2006
01:08:05,755 --> 01:08:07,705

2112
01:11:25,379 --> 01:11:27,150
my mom was scammed recently on a

2113
01:11:27,150 --> 01:11:31,021
phone thing i think so yeah but

2114
01:11:31,230 --> 01:11:32,679
a a lot maybe she just haven't

2115
01:11:32,748 --> 01:11:33,780
well she

2116
01:11:34,950 --> 01:11:36,690
the guy has been calling her back

2117
01:11:37,680 --> 01:11:39,840
and keeps keeps doing so of me

2118
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:42,210
for scamming you know i'm in love

2119
01:11:42,210 --> 01:11:42,690
with you

2120
01:11:44,820 --> 01:11:46,950
essentially she she clicked on one of

2121
01:11:46,950 --> 01:11:49,950
those websites that like your computer is

2122
01:11:49,950 --> 01:11:51,240
frozen and you have to call a

2123
01:11:51,240 --> 01:11:53,310
number you know yes i remember this

2124
01:11:53,310 --> 01:11:54,780
yeah and then she calls and she

2125
01:11:54,780 --> 01:11:55,650
gets she like

2126
01:11:56,910 --> 01:12:00,390
grants them access into her computer yeah

2127
01:12:00,390 --> 01:12:01,530
this kind of stuff and then she

2128
01:12:01,530 --> 01:12:04,530
pays them in order to anyway so

2129
01:12:04,740 --> 01:12:06,300
so the guy though has been now

2130
01:12:06,330 --> 01:12:08,220
calling her on the phone to try

2131
01:12:08,220 --> 01:12:10,470
to reengage because that's what they do

2132
01:12:10,830 --> 01:12:12,750
is if they find someone who's given

2133
01:12:12,750 --> 01:12:15,780
money once you know they may be

2134
01:12:15,780 --> 01:12:17,040
likely to give it twice

2135
01:12:17,430 --> 01:12:19,710
so she's just been like you know

2136
01:12:19,740 --> 01:12:21,570
declining these calls all the time it's

2137
01:12:21,570 --> 01:12:23,580
just so it's so such a bummer

2138
01:12:23,580 --> 01:12:25,800
for old people to like fall victim

2139
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:27,930
to this kind of stuff yeah yeah

2140
01:12:27,960 --> 01:12:30,390

few words of it and then it'll

2188
01:14:05,280 --> 01:14:06,360
come up i'm like oh yeah this

2189
01:14:06,360 --> 01:14:08,370
is a fake thing yeah yeah but

2190
01:14:08,400 --> 01:14:10,530
are there when we get older are

2191
01:14:10,530 --> 01:14:11,550
there going to be things that we

2192
01:14:11,550 --> 01:14:13,170
don't understand that we're like

2193
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:17,520
that's a good question because we i

2194
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:20,250
mean we we are of age ah

2195
01:14:20,340 --> 01:14:24,390
with modern technology and knowing how people

2196
01:14:24,420 --> 01:14:27,180
exploit it and so like you know

2197
01:14:27,180 --> 01:14:28,530
if i get a i guess it's

2198
01:14:28,530 --> 01:14:31,710
like how convincing someone can be as

2199
01:14:31,710 --> 01:14:32,910
an actor because if you get a

2200
01:14:33,120 --> 01:14:33,840
robocall that

2201
01:14:33,876 --> 01:14:36,330
like your social security number is about

2202
01:14:36,330 --> 01:14:38,430
to expire you're like okay so this

2203
01:14:38,430 --> 01:14:40,110
is horse shit i know your social

2204
01:14:40,110 --> 01:14:42,240
security number doesn't expire you know your

2205
01:14:42,240 --> 01:14:45,090
auto warranty or whatever um but if

2206
01:14:45,090 --> 01:14:46,980
somebody's a good and i mean scams

2207
01:14:47,010 --> 01:14:48,150
really depend on

2208
01:14:49,200 --> 01:14:50,940
are you a good enough actor to

2209
01:14:50,940 --> 01:14:52,800
convince the person that what you're saying

2210
01:14:52,800 --> 01:14:55,374
is true right you know and like

2211
01:14:55,417 --> 01:14:56,940
that's why i think the robocalls are

2212
01:14:57,120 --> 01:14:58,620
you they can't get that many people

2213
01:14:58,620 --> 01:15:00,270
with those days they weren't like i've

2214
01:15:00,270 --> 01:15:01,980
read about him they work enough to

2215
01:15:01,980 --> 01:15:03,060
where it's worth it for them

2216
01:15:04,110 --> 01:15:06,720
right wow yeah well yeah essentially it's

2217
01:15:06,720 --> 01:15:07,710
free money i mean all you have

2218
01:15:07,710 --> 01:15:08,670
to do is set that thing up

2219
01:15:08,670 --> 01:15:10,800
there's very little effort involved right but

2220
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:12,930
i wonder what could happen that would

2221
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:14,430
i mean obviously the ones where they

2222
01:15:14,430 --> 01:15:16,800
send you a fake email from one

2223
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:18,480
of your places to get your password

2224
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:20,460
that like anyone our age fun yeah

2225
01:15:20,490 --> 01:15:23,460
sometimes like what could be something that

2226
01:15:23,460 --> 01:15:24,240
we would fall for

2227
01:15:24,240 --> 01:15:24,630
four

2228
01:15:26,310 --> 01:15:27,960
i don't know i mean maybe l

2229
01:15:27,960 --> 01:15:29,550
invented in the future where we're so

2230
01:15:29,582 --> 01:15:31,470
where it's yeah probably my kid just

2231
01:15:31,470 --> 01:15:33,330
more believable where it's like they know

2232
01:15:33,330 --> 01:15:35,730
the company that you actually are registered

2233
01:15:35,730 --> 01:15:37,740
with and they are they have some

2234
01:15:37,740 --> 01:15:40,470
more information or something yeah this is

2235
01:15:40,470 --> 01:15:41,820
yeah eighteen t and you have a

2236
01:15:41,820 --> 01:15:43,470
phone line with us and lovable but

2237
01:15:43,470 --> 01:15:44,520
you know or whatever and then it's

2238
01:15:44,520 --> 01:15:45,840
like true and so you're like oh

2239
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:48,360
oh right okay um yeah i don't

2240
01:15:48,360 --> 01:15:50,700
know it's so scary though that that

2241
01:15:50,700 --> 01:15:52,080
you can just get old and not

2242
01:15:52,110 --> 01:15:53,640
know what's going on in the world

2243
01:15:53,640 --> 01:15:55,230
anymore and people can take advantage of

2244
01:15:55,230 --> 01:15:56,340
that i mean i do feel like

2245
01:15:56,340 --> 01:15:59,070
the generation before our generation is like

2246
01:15:59,100 --> 01:16:01,170
in the worst position for that because

2247
01:16:01,380 --> 01:16:03,390
technology like sped up so much and

2248
01:16:03,390 --> 01:16:04,950
they were not really taught all of

2249
01:16:04,950 --> 01:16:06,000
that stuff so yeah

2250
01:16:06,510 --> 01:16:10,230
that's way harder right i mean unless

2251
01:16:10,230 --> 01:16:12,030
there's a huge leap in the next

2252
01:16:12,030 --> 01:16:13,770
few years where we're unable to like

2253
01:16:14,280 --> 01:16:16,470
keep up with it which seems deep

2254
01:16:16,470 --> 01:16:18,870
fakes de fe that's a pretty good

2255
01:16:18,870 --> 01:16:20,700
one because you'll get face time from

2256
01:16:20,700 --> 01:16:22,800
your niece or whatever and it's not

2257
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:24,330
your knees and that would be really

2258
01:16:24,330 --> 01:16:26,130
fucked i need all the money

2259
01:16:26,460 --> 01:16:28,140
and you know drama oh i'm in

2260
01:16:28,140 --> 01:16:30,420
jail stuck industry these give me the

2261
01:16:30,450 --> 01:16:32,520
money alright let's take a break when

2262
01:16:32,520 --> 01:16:33,360
we come back we'll do a three

2263
01:16:33,360 --> 01:16:33,930
jerk alright

2264
01:16:37,560 --> 01:16:41,370
we're back where i live too well

2265
01:16:41,370 --> 01:16:43,830
yes no i think organising to say

2266
01:16:43,860 --> 01:16:45,810
they were going to say we're gonna

2267
01:16:45,810 --> 01:16:49,172
say so yeah no no i mean

2268
01:16:49,172 --> 01:16:50,340
just say for three shot what did

2269
01:16:50,340 --> 01:16:52,830
you say nothing is further of course

2270
01:16:52,890 --> 01:16:55,200
this little bit is a perfect segue

2271
01:16:55,200 --> 01:16:56,790
a into the future that i chosen

2272
01:16:57,690 --> 01:17:00,390
so this why it is this

2273
01:17:01,830 --> 01:17:03,450

what i heard okay so paul had

2335
01:19:09,540 --> 01:19:12,450
a halloween costume that was like something

2336
01:19:12,450 --> 01:19:14,520
over his head and then he also

2337
01:19:14,520 --> 01:19:17,310
had roller skates i made it really

2338
01:19:17,310 --> 01:19:18,990
hard to go upstairs so he had

2339
01:19:18,990 --> 01:19:21,300
like walked sideways up the stairs and

2340
01:19:21,300 --> 01:19:23,160
downs like do the trick or treating

2341
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:24,180
and it was really

2342
01:19:24,240 --> 01:19:27,270
i'm comfortable and scott scott met a

2343
01:19:27,270 --> 01:19:28,860
tall short person who's seven feet tall

2344
01:19:28,860 --> 01:19:30,060
and then they had a ring box

2345
01:19:30,060 --> 01:19:31,890
and snapped at like julia roberts in

2346
01:19:32,130 --> 01:19:33,810
pretty well you missed the entire middle

2347
01:19:35,490 --> 01:19:38,370
yeah that's second

2348
01:19:40,140 --> 01:19:42,450
i wondering how people listening to this

2349
01:19:42,450 --> 01:19:45,000
will i mean you can focus on

2350
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:46,620
one play you focus on the family

2351
01:19:46,620 --> 01:19:47,640
well that's the thing i was trying

2352
01:19:47,640 --> 01:19:50,340
to timely both and i often think

2353
01:19:50,340 --> 01:19:51,930
i'm good at doing that you don't

2354
01:19:51,990 --> 01:19:53,160
mean like in life where i'll be

2355
01:19:53,160 --> 01:19:54,480
like i'm hearing everything that's happening right

2356
01:19:54,480 --> 01:19:55,560
now and there's like no you're not

2357
01:19:55,830 --> 01:19:58,050
okay obviously i'm horrible at it i

2358
01:19:58,050 --> 01:19:59,760
listened to the two of you yeah

2359
01:19:59,760 --> 01:20:02,160
yes do i'm gonna keep time i

2360
01:20:02,160 --> 01:20:04,620
can i can probably do it it's

2361
01:20:04,620 --> 01:20:06,030
actually found that a little distracting when

2362
01:20:06,030 --> 01:20:07,410
i was talking when i was listening

2363
01:20:07,440 --> 01:20:08,040

01:21:18,590 --> 01:21:20,600
thirty seconds paul you had a teacher

01:21:20,600 --> 01:21:22,370
who was a nun named mrs pachinko

2399
01:21:22,370 --> 01:21:23,780

01:21:23,780 --> 01:21:25,190

2401
01:21:25,190 --> 01:21:27,590
the jesus christ superstar cast album for

2402
01:21:27,590 --> 01:21:29,540
you in class and it was a

2403
01:21:29,540 --> 01:21:31,670
very moving experience you don't remember whether

2404
01:21:31,670 --> 01:21:32,870
it was song by song or whether

2405
01:21:32,870 --> 01:21:34,100
it was all played at the whole

2406
01:21:34,100 --> 01:21:34,550
time

2407
01:21:35,150 --> 01:21:36,860
lauren there was a period in the

2408
01:21:36,860 --> 01:21:39,260
nineties or something when people were making

2409
01:21:39,290 --> 01:21:41,270
new roller coasters all the time and

2410
01:21:41,270 --> 01:21:43,010
then so they switched them over to

2411
01:21:43,010 --> 01:21:45,170
being halloween themed roller coasters and someone

2412
01:21:45,170 --> 01:21:48,170
videotaped people's reactions to being on them

2413
01:21:48,170 --> 01:21:50,450
which was illegal now that's totally wrong

2414
01:21:51,620 --> 01:21:54,253
ah i mean i made it up

2415
01:21:54,264 --> 01:21:55,760
it was just a rambling story but

2416
01:21:57,020 --> 01:21:58,280
the the who it was was a

2417
01:21:58,280 --> 01:21:59,690
woman a teacher told the kids to

2418
01:21:59,690 --> 01:22:01,400
scream on the rollercoasters and they recorded

2419
01:22:01,400 --> 01:22:02,780
the screens they also recorded her telling

2420
01:22:02,780 --> 01:22:03,920
the kids to scream and then went

2421
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:05,060
to jail for her whole life and

2422
01:22:05,060 --> 01:22:06,350
she's still in jail to the stand

2423
01:22:06,350 --> 01:22:09,320
she's slow xy yeah okay well i

2424
01:22:09,320 --> 01:22:12,170
was always close with you you were

2425
01:22:12,170 --> 01:22:13,670
pretty close i think you were probably

2426
01:22:13,670 --> 01:22:15,140
you heard jesus christ superstar you started

2427
01:22:15,140 --> 01:22:16,970
paying more attention to me um

2428
01:22:17,570 --> 01:22:19,250
but ah no i said well lauren

2429
01:22:19,250 --> 01:22:20,840
was going so slow and barely said

2430
01:22:20,840 --> 01:22:22,100
anything so i was able to really

2431
01:22:22,970 --> 01:22:23,990
concentrate on you

2432
01:22:25,130 --> 01:22:26,540
eating after every because i was making

2433
01:22:26,540 --> 01:22:28,460
it up again telling i do like

2434
01:22:28,640 --> 01:22:31,310
your nun named mrs pachinko but i

2435
01:22:31,310 --> 01:22:32,900
do think maybe this is a hint

2436
01:22:32,900 --> 01:22:35,180
because yeah telling a real story is

2437
01:22:35,180 --> 01:22:36,920
easier to follow i followed paul story

2438
01:22:36,920 --> 01:22:39,230
better than i thought sky yeah so

2439
01:22:39,230 --> 01:22:41,810

2475
01:23:48,800 --> 01:23:51,170

2476
01:23:51,170 --> 01:23:53,510
when they started the shooting way over

2477
01:23:53,510 --> 01:23:55,850
to the world so territory holding monster

2478
01:23:55,850 --> 01:23:58,250
october and but i was watching nothing

2479
01:23:58,250 --> 01:24:00,260
right because ultimately i still feel like

2480
01:24:00,260 --> 01:24:01,730
plate still feels like oh what did

2481
01:24:01,730 --> 01:24:03,140
i have to do something like that

2482
01:24:03,140 --> 01:24:05,120
memory of seeing the why was it

2483
01:24:05,120 --> 01:24:06,650
that they rolling up a paper

2484
01:24:06,650 --> 01:24:08,270
like that and those realising they've got

2485
01:24:08,270 --> 01:24:09,830
the word series happened to these children

2486
01:24:09,830 --> 01:24:11,030
having to do the show so it's

2487
01:24:11,630 --> 01:24:14,990
not just a random okay and laura

2488
01:24:15,080 --> 01:24:17,000
lauren audition for noises off but she

2489
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:18,860
did not get it and they know

2490
01:24:18,890 --> 01:24:20,450
not doing the show at all for

2491
01:24:20,450 --> 01:24:21,825
some reason they did something because you

2492
01:24:21,980 --> 01:24:23,900
get eric and lauren did not understand

2493
01:24:23,900 --> 01:24:26,180
why some people got picked again and

2494
01:24:26,180 --> 01:24:26,810
again to be in

2495
01:24:26,810 --> 01:24:27,890
these shows and other people do not

2496
01:24:28,280 --> 01:24:30,680
ah scott was talking about the captain

2497
01:24:30,710 --> 01:24:34,160
of the newspaper delivery squad um you

2498
01:24:34,160 --> 01:24:35,240
would go over the captain's house roll

2499
01:24:35,240 --> 01:24:37,310
the newspapers together and reading in the

2500
01:24:37,310 --> 01:24:40,070
newspaper of people calling reggie jackson mister

2501
01:24:40,070 --> 01:24:43,160
october is when scott realized ah that

2502
01:24:43,160 --> 01:24:44,420
the world series happens at the same

2503
01:24:44,420 --> 01:24:46,970
time staff yeah i mean really yeah

2504
01:24:46,970 --> 01:24:49,970
hard for me really good maybe it

2505
01:24:49,970 --> 01:24:52,175
isn't easier when people are telling actually

2506
01:24:52,175 --> 01:24:53,870
yes we do to fake stories

2507
01:24:54,920 --> 01:24:57,410
two fake stories but both topos because

2508
01:24:57,410 --> 01:24:58,430
he was so good and he did

2509
01:24:58,430 --> 01:24:59,886
it so okay so much food it's

2510
01:24:59,900 --> 01:25:01,460
a real test so we'll do to

2511
01:25:01,460 --> 01:25:03,230
fake stories to paul and see how

2512
01:25:03,260 --> 01:25:05,270
good he actually is okay

2513
01:25:06,410 --> 01:25:07,820
and that'll be the deciding factor of

2514
01:25:07,820 --> 01:25:10,700
nothing okay okay and

2515
01:25:11,930 --> 01:25:13,880
oh i remember when i would make

2516
01:25:13,880 --> 01:25:15,800
