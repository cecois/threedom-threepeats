556
00:19:47,325 --> 00:19:48,975

00:19:49,305 --> 00:19:51,285
the code didn't fucking work like this

558
00:19:51,285 --> 00:19:52,695
is bull items to pay hundreds of

559
00:19:52,695 --> 00:19:55,215
dollars to use this thing that fuckin

560
00:19:55,245 --> 00:19:57,525

563
00:20:01,455 --> 00:20:03,585

567
00:20:12,585 --> 00:20:14,565

so i can make notes before a

571
00:20:19,313 --> 00:20:20,955
show starts and then it's like that's

572
00:20:20,955 --> 00:20:22,365
the wrong password i'm like well which

573
00:20:22,695 --> 00:20:23,655

sinatra also said this and i i

684

unique to that so if it's like

786
00:27:52,455 --> 00:27:53,985
instagram which i don't think she has

787
00:27:53,985 --> 00:27:55,785

790
00:28:00,855 --> 00:28:03,405
do but she she can't remember any

791
00:28:03,405 --> 00:28:04,305
of them so she has to write

792
00:28:04,305 --> 00:28:05,415
them down in a notebook

793
00:28:05,565 --> 00:28:07,335

if i hit it with basketball because

1511
00:52:39,170 --> 00:52:40,670
i got my wisdom teeth removed in

1512
00:52:40,670 --> 00:52:42,680
my thirty or no twenties and they

1513
00:52:42,680 --> 00:52:44,720
were holding everything together and it was

1514
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:47,690
a very thin bone in my jaw

1515
00:52:47,690 --> 00:52:49,160
when they took them out and then

1516
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:51,290
he was like you got hit in

1517
00:52:51,290 --> 00:52:52,040
the face of the basket

1518
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:53,270
you could break your jaw and i

1519
00:52:53,270 --> 00:52:54,380
was like well i already have been

1520
00:52:54,380 --> 00:52:56,480

1521
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:58,490
says well which team were you on

1522
00:52:58,970 --> 00:53:00,020
the kimi drillers

1523
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:03,800
i used to like when i would

1524
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:05,060
say for the first ten years of

1525
00:53:05,060 --> 00:53:07,640
me doing comedy it felt like every

1526
00:53:07,670 --> 00:53:11,330
three months every like you'd hear word

1527
00:53:11,330 --> 00:53:12,440
like hey we're gonna go down to

1528
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:15,380
the park and do kickball and then

1529
00:53:15,380 --> 00:53:17,060
like everyone would show up yeah like

1535
00:53:23,603 --> 00:53:24,770

playing first base and he gave me

1549
00:53:53,810 --> 00:53:55,400

1551
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:58,460

00:54:02,150 --> 00:54:03,920

1556
00:54:03,950 --> 00:54:05,270
like it was kind of what you

1557
00:54:05,270 --> 00:54:06,680
should know well it's like i'm a

1558
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:08,444

i'm

1586
00:55:03,099 --> 00:55:04,610
wrong last grateful to hear it ever

1587
00:55:04,627 --> 00:55:06,590
left anytime and i've always they would

1588
00:55:06,590 --> 00:55:08,150
only allow me to check swing i

1589
00:55:08,150 --> 00:55:10,940
couldn't really swing what's generally allow you

1590
00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:12,860
to check swing my coach because he

1591
00:55:12,860 --> 00:55:14,840
was like well you can't you obviously

1592
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:16,250
can't hit it just do a light

1593
00:55:16,340 --> 00:55:18,020
just do it it's basically like doing

1594
00:55:18,020 --> 00:55:19,670
a bunch whatever and so anytime i'd

1595
00:55:19,670 --> 00:55:21,530
come to the plate everyone would go

1596
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:22,670
everyone move up

1597
00:55:22,790 --> 00:55:24,590
don't move up wow she's just a

1598
00:55:24,590 --> 00:55:26,420
masculine but once i hit a triple

1599
00:55:26,420 --> 00:55:28,340
and it was just dang nice work

1600
00:55:28,367 --> 00:55:29,540
and everyone was like we went into

1601
00:55:29,570 --> 00:55:32,180
gloomy i gave you the wrong advice

1602
00:55:32,300 --> 00:55:34,010
everyone moved back but no that's too

1603
00:55:34,010 --> 00:55:35,538
far back you're out of the stadium

1604
00:55:35,630 --> 00:55:38,390
someone find that ball and they weren't

1605
00:55:38,390 --> 00:55:39,620
yelling they were just talking like this

1606
00:55:39,620 --> 00:55:41,930
seems like a common theory yes

1607
00:55:42,908 --> 00:55:44,660
just come to me like people are

1608
00:55:44,660 --> 00:55:47,420

oh totally ya just say the thing

1610
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:52,160

00:57:46,100 --> 00:57:47,990
yeah the word robber isn't used very

1668
00:57:48,020 --> 00:57:50,780
much no it's no because people yeah

1669
00:57:50,780 --> 00:57:53,120
it's like thief burglar do you know

1670
00:57:53,120 --> 00:57:55,670
what killed it cops and robertson's yeah

1671
00:57:55,730 --> 00:57:57,950
that movie your not a cop you're

1672
00:57:57,950 --> 00:57:58,940
a robertson

1673
00:57:59,900 --> 00:58:01,670
that's a line in it but we

1674
00:58:01,670 --> 00:58:02,750
used to say that all the time

1675
00:58:05,067 --> 00:58:06,470
it's a good well no okay the

1676
00:58:06,470 --> 00:58:08,270
trailer cops and robbers since what is

1677
00:58:08,270 --> 00:58:10,670
that it's a chevy chase movie jack

1678
00:58:10,670 --> 00:58:13,430
jackson changes and he he pulls chevy

1679
00:58:13,430 --> 00:58:15,470
chase close to me you are not

1680
00:58:15,470 --> 00:58:16,970
a cop and then we would always

1681
00:58:16,970 --> 00:58:18,500
say because we saw this trailer so

1682
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:20,090
many times we would always say you

1683
00:58:20,090 --> 00:58:21,080
are a robber so

1684
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:24,410
what was the plot of cups and

1685
00:58:24,410 --> 00:58:26,360
robertsons i think they were under they

1686
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:28,330
had to be undercover in like jam

1687
00:58:28,340 --> 00:58:29,749
well sort of yeah probably yeah it

1688
00:58:29,749 --> 00:58:33,680
was the robertsons who knows chevy's thought

1689
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:35,360
he was a cop just because of

1690
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:36,860
his proximity to cops he was like

1691
00:58:37,010 --> 00:58:38,540
i'm like he knew he was roberson

1692
00:58:38,540 --> 00:58:39,620
i'll tell you that much he knew

1693
00:58:39,620 --> 00:58:41,930

as a wish especially one in the

1699
00:58:58,820 --> 00:59:01,129
form of an ugly old woman that

1700
00:59:01,129 --> 00:59:04,370
special would you rather claim one hag

1701
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:07,310

00:59:11,780 --> 00:59:14,480
oh topic we haven't gotten into we

1705
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:16,310
haven't gotten into this topic yet about

1706
00:59:16,310 --> 00:59:18,650
whether we would rather have one hack

1707
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:22,070
claim us or we haven't explored this

1708
00:59:22,820 --> 00:59:24,410
i know so i think it's really

1709
00:59:24,410 --> 00:59:26,090
clever question we talk about this on

1710
00:59:26,090 --> 00:59:27,827
a preview i think i totally worry

1711
00:59:27,827 --> 00:59:29,207
about when i claim to hang but

1712
00:59:30,110 --> 00:59:31,400
if i had you'll know but

1713
00:59:31,940 --> 00:59:33,740
ah whatever other claim a haggar have

1714
00:59:33,770 --> 00:59:35,540
eight hands claim me no i don't

1715
00:59:35,540 --> 00:59:38,090
want to hack running around in my

1716
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:39,740
kitchen but if you're claimed by eight

1717
00:59:39,770 --> 00:59:41,600
eggs you don't have a kitchen you're

1718
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:42,560
american with that

1719
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:45,920
i i kind of think i would

1720
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:48,200
like eight hags to claim me yeah

1721
00:59:48,290 --> 00:59:49,160
what are they going to do with

1722
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:50,720
you maybe they'll make me a hag

1723
00:59:51,230 --> 00:59:53,780
yeah right they'll make you ah hey

1724
00:59:53,810 --> 00:59:55,340
i guess i'd rather be claimed by

1725
00:59:55,340 --> 00:59:57,290
eight hags and have everyone's write your

1726
00:59:57,350 --> 00:59:59,000
name one i don't yeah and i'll

1727
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:02,450

be claimed by eight hansen clay

1729

01:00:10,280 --> 01:00:11,930

01:03:09,815 --> 01:03:11,735
made me read her the stories because

1823
01:03:11,735 --> 01:03:13,475
i was such a good reader that

1824
01:03:13,475 --> 01:03:14,045
she was like

1825
01:03:14,045 --> 01:03:15,245
if you read the story sounds like

1826
01:03:15,245 --> 01:03:18,215
a trick and you're really john krishna

1827
01:03:18,635 --> 01:03:21,965
yeah he killed her down and attacked

1828
01:03:21,995 --> 01:03:24,425
her yeah it was forcible rape if

1829
01:03:24,425 --> 01:03:27,665
they made ah a grownup story that

1830
01:03:27,665 --> 01:03:29,495
was the length of a children's book

1831
01:03:29,795 --> 01:03:31,895
yeah that's a smart idea yeah it's

1832
01:03:31,895 --> 01:03:33,065
like you read to me and this

1833
01:03:33,065 --> 01:03:34,145
is like great interesting

1834
01:03:34,745 --> 01:03:36,275
but anyway so let's see what colors

1835
01:03:36,305 --> 01:03:39,335
recently recently every time she has to

1836
01:03:39,335 --> 01:03:41,645
do it she'll come downstairs i'm watching

1837
01:03:41,675 --> 01:03:44,765
dr pimple popper do you're watching yes

1838
01:03:45,065 --> 01:03:48,935
that's just for women why women seem

1839
01:03:48,995 --> 01:03:51,185
ah like this is just my experience

1840
01:03:51,185 --> 01:03:53,225
that women seem to be more in

1841
01:03:53,892 --> 01:03:54,275
shares

1842
01:03:54,365 --> 01:03:56,225
gender well you like watching it's not

1843
01:03:56,225 --> 01:03:57,335
gender by the way the big issue

1844
01:03:57,335 --> 01:03:58,715
