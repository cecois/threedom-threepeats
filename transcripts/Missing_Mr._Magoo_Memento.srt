so much as it is it's shocking

102
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:54,000
like when you see

103
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:55,470
more than one person do an impression

104
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:57,150
of you and you're like i guess

105
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:58,683
there is a consensus in what i

106
00:03:58,683 --> 00:04:00,300
assumed what i what i'm i was

107
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,760
actually wondering this the other day if

108
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:04,680
someone would do it impressions mean what

109
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,970
they wouldn't do besides when you're just

110
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:08,850
mixing hundred jackie kay well besides just

111
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:11,610
making fun of someone right um you

b do it in like do an

114
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,020
impression of each of us isn't a

115
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:21,060
day she dubose very like a quick

116
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:22,560
kind of thing it was crazy it

117
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,460
didn't end up in and i was

118
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:25,080
doing character so i didn't get it

119
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,550
wasn't it wasn't during the episode is

120
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:29,100
when it wasn't during the episode oh

121
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:31,080
yes she didn't know much and made

122
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,070
a mean face when she did it

123
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,260
but but i but

124
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:35,580
i was listening to her impression me

125
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:37,020
i'm like i don't recognize i don't

126
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:38,340
hear myself in it because she was

127
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:41,040
like nah i'm scott and i'm nervous

128
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:43,920
hey really scared like he really he

129
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:44,400
leave it

130
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:46,590
have some choose

131
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,290
cheese i don't like that

132
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,480
i think i think considering that i

133
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,710
think she was trying to like capture

134
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:57,690
a flavor of everybody very quickly right

135
00:04:57,690 --> 00:04:59,130
right right but it's hard it's hard

136
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:02,340
it's also hard i think um four

137
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,550
like male to female or female to

138
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:07,890
male to do an impression of someone

139
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:10,320
if if you can't get that same

140
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,760
tone it seems like it's easier to

141
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,620
do an impression of someone when they

142
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:15,390
are a comedian because they have a

143
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:17,970
certain cadence that they their comic cadence

144
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:20,910
that they've perfected you know actually yeah

145
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:22,320
but so like you know when you

146
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,460
hear someone do a loose gay

147
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:26,580
ca impression um you know like change

148
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:28,800

at first but when we went on

187
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:39,420

00:10:57,850 --> 00:10:59,440
about heaven and what yeah yeah man

327
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,950
shy she like it started thinking about

328
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:04,600
the iraq war this was in the

329
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:06,085
inches like why would god do this

330
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,390
during the iraq pretty much she was

331
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:09,670
like this was during the iraq war

332
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:09,850
yeah

333
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:12,970
just like hey you're saying this is

334
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:15,340
the mid two thousands because yeah for

335
00:11:15,351 --> 00:11:17,140
like i mean that's when she was

336
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:17,980
she was thinking about it as it

337
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:18,940
was half right right that's what i

338
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:19,436
meant right

339
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,730
oh it's it's like trying to tell

340
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:23,740
people when the war hey guys in

341
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:24,910
case you haven't heard about a world

342
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,560
record that happened in the two thousand

343
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:28,900
um and it just said a study

344
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:30,460
saying wow

345
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:34,180
um so she was trying to think

346
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:37,150
about she's trying to she was raised

347
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:38,560
to believe that god had a reason

348
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,480
for everything yeah she was trying to

349
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,400
think about what reason he could have

350
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,205
for the iraq war and she had

351
00:11:44,205 --> 00:11:45,190
a right to take she was like

352
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:47,110
thinking all night it just like unravel

353
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:49,990
because it's like that's i think that's

354
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:51,610
really interesting because if you if you

355
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:53,230
think god has a reason for everything

356
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,120
it's fine that the war was what

357
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,140
finally did it for her but like

358
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:57,850
i'm sure she witnessed a ton of

359
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:00,130
bad stuff it isn't the reason isn't

360
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:03,250
the reason that free-will like he gives

361
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:04,480
us free will and so bad stuff

362
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,800
has to happen in order to have

363
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:06,700
free you know what else that's the

364
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,020
only thing is that you don't think

365
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:08,290
about it

366
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:09,610
too much yeah i mean that's the

367
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:11,530
only reason the sentence right that stuff

368
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:13,390
yeah you know because if you get

369
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:15,580
into all the horrors and hurts like

370
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:18,010
why would this happen yeah it's that's

371
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:19,629

having a disagreement about the sound or

804
00:26:37,875 --> 00:26:39,525

806
00:26:40,515 --> 00:26:42,705
no no just calm down the guy

807
00:26:42,705 --> 00:26:44,715
was the worst the entire show and

808
00:26:44,715 --> 00:26:46,605
during the actual show in front of

809
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:48,255
a live studio audience was taught

810
00:26:48,255 --> 00:26:51,255
being so loud to his buddy that

811
00:26:51,495 --> 00:26:53,895
the audiences like going what they're like

812
00:26:53,895 --> 00:26:56,085
league there and he's a sound guy

813
00:26:56,085 --> 00:26:57,225
it's very rude to say is this

814
00:26:57,225 --> 00:26:58,935
your friend and you say yes and

815
00:26:58,935 --> 00:27:00,255
then you continue to say something rude

816
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:01,425
yeah and he didn't know that i

817
00:27:01,425 --> 00:27:02,925
was the executive producer of the show

818
00:27:02,955 --> 00:27:04,185
oh okay i didn't know who i

819
00:27:04,185 --> 00:27:05,895
was um yea all he knew was

820
00:27:05,895 --> 00:27:07,065
you are a human being and that

821
00:27:07,065 --> 00:27:08,415
wasn't enough yeah but that's

822
00:27:08,505 --> 00:27:11,085
an insane leap to make like now

823
00:27:11,085 --> 00:27:14,265
i'm gonna say this thing yeah dusty

824
00:27:14,295 --> 00:27:15,525
so it was he the sound guy

825
00:27:15,525 --> 00:27:16,905
for just a music or for the

826
00:27:16,905 --> 00:27:18,765
show for the show okay so that

827
00:27:18,765 --> 00:27:20,175
was that was where i was like

828
00:27:20,175 --> 00:27:21,855

okay well i'm gonna start putting the

1024
00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:52,960
list together and i think the thing

1025
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,810
is my actual interest with country is

1026
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,700
the really bad country that's coming out

1027
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:00,280
nowadays where it's kind of like um

1028
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:02,350
there's like a remix element to it

1029
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:03,790
sort of you know i just

1030
00:34:04,930 --> 00:34:07,330
it's via the oreo shake guy because

1031
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:08,710
in all of a sudden in the

1032
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:09,970
middle he has that hip-hop be going

1033
00:34:09,970 --> 00:34:12,700
boom boom that's the kind of thing

1034
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:13,903
i like that shit what's the name

1035
00:34:13,903 --> 00:34:14,980
of that song because i think a

1036
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:16,870
lot of people in ramble bees and

1037
00:34:16,870 --> 00:34:20,080
the milkshake and stay around and we

1038
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:23,230
get baked in the road and that's

1039
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:24,490
how we like it

1040
00:34:25,381 --> 00:34:27,280

she wanted item fries and a frosty

1063
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,410
so this song is basically all about

1064
00:35:18,610 --> 00:35:19,120
pow

1065
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,250

1155
00:38:27,548 --> 00:38:29,230
shit out dirty but it was my

1156
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:30,730

watch he was so like happy and

1159
00:38:33,490 --> 00:38:35,137
like being really funny and like having

1160
00:38:35,170 --> 00:38:36,820
good timing earnest and like really good

1161
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:39,010
dancer it was just gracious basically you

1162
00:38:39,070 --> 00:38:40,420
and i was you know i've talked

1163
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:41,950
to nikki glaser about this but like

1164
00:38:41,950 --> 00:38:43,300
would you go on dancing i have

1165
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:43,510
said

1166
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:44,590
i say to mike all the time

1167
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:45,490
i would like to be on dancing

1168
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:46,690
with the stars i think it'd be

1169
00:38:46,990 --> 00:38:48,760
really embarrassing ultimately i think i would

1170
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:50,860
because you ready so bad but there's

1171
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:51,850
why do you think you'd be so

1172
00:38:51,850 --> 00:38:52,840
bad though i don't know but there's

1173
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,010
two types of dance that i think

1174
00:38:54,010 --> 00:38:55,270
are fun that i would like to

1175
00:38:55,270 --> 00:38:58,932
do cha-cha jive okay and then that's

1176
00:38:58,932 --> 00:38:59,980
the other one that's really fun like

1177
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:00,280
that

1178
00:39:01,990 --> 00:39:03,580
if you remember but there's another one

1179
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:05,320
that's kind of foot master okay yeah

1180
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,280
and i think that's really fun when

1181
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,749
they're like kind of like put up

1182
00:39:07,749 --> 00:39:10,090
a football but i like but but

1183
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:11,440
what if you were good like you

1184
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,760
couldn't be as bad as the worst

1185
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:14,342
guy this year well yeah because i'm

1186
00:39:14,470 --> 00:39:15,670
i'm a performer i would at least

1187
00:39:15,670 --> 00:39:17,110
like be trying i just don't know

1188
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:18,910
that they were good they work with

1189
00:39:18,910 --> 00:39:20,530
you to such an extent that maybe

1190
00:39:20,530 --> 00:39:21,490
you'd be good i mean nicky

1191
00:39:21,490 --> 00:39:23,590
a glaser talks about how how hard

1192
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:25,060
it was yeah i think physically it

1193
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:26,290
must but don't talk her out of

1194
00:39:26,350 --> 00:39:27,550
how bad she might be i think

1195
00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:28,060
you will be done

1196
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:32,680

1204
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:48,610

pitched ah

1206
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:51,880
she's often pitched the producer's like doing

1207
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:53,680
a best of the worst season because

1208
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:54,995
she got kicked out first yeah sure

1209
00:39:54,995 --> 00:39:59,080
which is just humiliating but um but

00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:01,570
yeah i mean it's i mean that's

1211
00:40:01,570 --> 00:40:03,220

1213
00:40:04,390 --> 00:40:05,950

tv has ever been

1285
00:42:31,595 --> 00:42:32,815
what are the best episodes even if

1286
00:42:32,815 --> 00:42:34,385

1287
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:35,915
of comedy bang bang like the two

1288
00:42:36,095 --> 00:42:38,253

1296
00:42:53,435 --> 00:42:55,175
me about it was that gay people

the gay person oh well jada husband

1298
00:42:59,405 --> 00:43:00,935
how do you meet whom you don't

1299
00:43:00,935 --> 00:43:02,405
think that sounds good about it was

1300
00:43:02,405 --> 00:43:06,575
they never had moments of unity among

1301
00:43:06,995 --> 00:43:11,135
the siblings or solely with my mother

1302
00:43:11,165 --> 00:43:12,785
real ever like you know what i

1303
00:43:12,785 --> 00:43:14,765
mean it was like mature jackie that

1304
00:43:14,765 --> 00:43:15,725
would have made it like they just

1305
00:43:15,725 --> 00:43:16,385

1307
00:43:18,305 --> 00:43:20,194

00:43:23,105 --> 00:43:27,395

good to see peter crouch on other

1315
00:43:38,225 --> 00:43:40,055
shows because then he's not dead anymore

1316
00:43:40,085 --> 00:43:42,305

00:43:47,045 --> 00:43:50,675

1321
00:43:50,825 --> 00:43:52,325
do you like okay so you don't

1322
00:43:52,325 --> 00:43:54,995
like watching shows where i don't like

1323
00:43:54,995 --> 00:43:56,519
it when everyone just hates each other

1324
00:43:56,530 --> 00:43:56,705
all

1325
00:43:56,735 --> 00:43:58,414
the time right well that's what your

1326
00:43:58,414 --> 00:44:01,042
you'd like ted last show yeah

1327
00:44:02,915 --> 00:44:04,715
david had to turn a guy into

1328
00:44:04,715 --> 00:44:06,725
a villain on that show wow they're

1329
00:44:06,725 --> 00:44:08,825
likely to be realise that everyone's do

1330
00:44:08,855 --> 00:44:10,205
nights we gotta make this one guy

1331
00:44:10,205 --> 00:44:11,615
bad now i'm watching

1332
00:44:13,175 --> 00:44:15,755
ah well if you if you had

1333
00:44:15,755 --> 00:44:17,585
a show yeah and i think you

1334
00:44:17,585 --> 00:44:17,975
should

1335
00:44:20,105 --> 00:44:21,455
if you had a show like would

1336
00:44:21,455 --> 00:44:23,255
you and you what what kind of

1337
00:44:23,255 --> 00:44:25,625
family dynamics are you interested in exploring

1338
00:44:26,045 --> 00:44:27,845
i think the family dynamic i think

1339
00:44:28,175 --> 00:44:29,615
first of all i think most families

1340
00:44:29,615 --> 00:44:31,625
are dysfunctional i think and more people

1341
00:44:31,625 --> 00:44:32,855
you add to them the worse it's

1342
00:44:32,855 --> 00:44:35,105
gonna get right um i think that

1343
00:44:35,735 --> 00:44:38,105
i like to see the alliances that

1344
00:44:38,105 --> 00:44:39,185
people have that's more

1345
00:44:39,215 --> 00:44:41,285
interesting to me because people team up

1346
00:44:41,825 --> 00:44:43,655
yeah on each night shifts you know

1347
00:44:43,685 --> 00:44:45,845
like depending on the situation like things

1348
00:44:45,845 --> 00:44:47,945
move around like six feet under that

1349
00:44:47,945 --> 00:44:50,915
a little arousal sister sometimes they were

1350
00:44:50,915 --> 00:44:52,325
they always liked each other but i'm

1351
00:44:52,325 --> 00:44:53,285
trying to think of other shit like

1352
00:44:53,285 --> 00:44:55,505
to transparent do that a bit about

1353
00:44:55,505 --> 00:44:56,885
what i didn't watch much of that

1354
00:44:56,945 --> 00:44:59,345
okay but i think

1355
00:44:59,435 --> 00:45:01,265
paul i was thinking about this the

1356
00:45:01,265 --> 00:45:03,185
other day i think you should have

1357
00:45:03,185 --> 00:45:04,685
a show what should you think that

1358
00:45:04,685 --> 00:45:06,035
should be it should be called mister
