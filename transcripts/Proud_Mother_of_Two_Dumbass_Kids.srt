00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,200
his name was red herring oh and

41
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,790
he was watching a standup show that

42
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:48,840
i was on he said i notice

43
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,850
you guys all would like you take

44
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:52,470
the cap off the water bottle and

45
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:53,640
then you put it back on you

46
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,890
have to keep unscrewing it to take

47
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:57,390
a sip of water and it's like

48
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:59,190

49
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:00,690
it's so silly

50
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:02,730
and i remember at the time like

51
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:04,350
immediately feeling like oh yeah that is

52
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:06,090
silly and then i realised because if

53
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:07,470

54
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:09,480

58
00:02:16,295 --> 00:02:17,820
something to do with your hands super

59
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:19,650

62
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,460

72
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,940
think that the satire was incisive when

you came in on a good point

74
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:50,280
when you take nursery rhymes and you

76
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:54,210

95
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:39,840
developed over time yeah because

1001
00:37:30,565 --> 00:37:32,665
me say this in fairness in fairness

1002
00:37:32,695 --> 00:37:34,315
i want to but i don't think

1003
00:37:34,315 --> 00:37:37,195
we can because last week he sent

1004
00:37:37,195 --> 00:37:38,935
us a tweak to it he sent

1005
00:37:38,935 --> 00:37:41,005
us and we gave him some pretty

1006
00:37:41,035 --> 00:37:42,775
clear feedback because he said something about

1007
00:37:42,775 --> 00:37:44,569
then they win the big prize yes

1008
00:37:44,575 --> 00:37:45,655
it would be like we realised what

1009
00:37:45,655 --> 00:37:47,485
is that big price we sent pretty

1010
00:37:47,545 --> 00:37:49,045
click clear feedback and we have not

1011
00:37:49,045 --> 00:37:50,665
heard back from him no and it's

1012
00:37:50,665 --> 00:37:52,165
like you can you he could email

1013
00:37:52,165 --> 00:37:53,725
us he could call us our number

1014
00:37:54,235 --> 00:37:55,765
gave out the number now did we

1015
00:37:55,765 --> 00:37:57,835
take both of these episodes back-to-back you

1016
00:37:57,835 --> 00:38:00,895
who knows i mean knows no one

1017
00:38:00,895 --> 00:38:03,235

1020
00:38:07,389 --> 00:38:07,675

we tried different one yeah yeah yeah

1022
00:38:10,255 --> 00:38:11,935
but the other that's the other reason

1023
00:38:11,935 --> 00:38:13,194
we can't do is we have to

1024
00:38:13,194 --> 00:38:14,545
do the other oh yeah well also

1025
00:38:14,545 --> 00:38:15,505

1139
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:11,200
and then you decide who's his best

1140
00:42:11,770 --> 00:42:13,030
would you just pick your own yeah

1141
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:14,830
right you don't know the case you

1142
00:42:14,830 --> 00:42:16,390
have to say yes alright so we're

1143
00:42:16,390 --> 00:42:17,740
looking at i

1144
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:20,890
i chose electric meat slicer okay a

1145
00:42:20,890 --> 00:42:23,080
brush with death and sleeping bag for

1146
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:24,760
angela merkel yeah i chose a brush

1147
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:27,070
with death because she's you know obviously

1148
00:42:27,070 --> 00:42:31,360
from germany and um they're really you

1149
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:32,980
know they're really fucked in the head

1150
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:36,580
yeah they're depressing people and so i

1151
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:38,140
thought that in plus she's just got

1152
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:39,610
a whole thing going on where she's

1153
00:42:39,610 --> 00:42:41,680
just so stern and now this is

1154
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:44,950
a gift yeah okay well it's on

1155
00:42:44,950 --> 00:42:47,500
the card i didn't pick it you

1156
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:48,970
literally did you gave it to me

1157
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,340
you have five cards from ya and

1158
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:54,220
you smelted so it was great wow

1159
00:42:54,370 --> 00:42:56,740
okay i chose the electric meat slicer

1160
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:58,150
because i thought she's german and she

1161
00:42:58,150 --> 00:42:59,380
wants the meats

1162
00:43:00,790 --> 00:43:01,750
you said that like it was a

1163
00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:02,140
thing

1164
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:06,130
huh but it's not a thing sir

1165
00:43:06,970 --> 00:43:09,550
i chose the sleeping bag because i

1166
00:43:09,550 --> 00:43:13,000
think she has retired or will soon

1167
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,800
retire because she's been chancellor for a

1168
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,810
long time right and she'll probably want

1169
00:43:16,810 --> 00:43:18,730
to do so she hasn't now time

1170
00:43:18,730 --> 00:43:20,918

1196
00:44:12,850 --> 00:44:14,500
obviously can't go wild so she just

1197
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:14,620
put

1198
00:44:14,620 --> 00:44:15,970

1204
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:27,790
was closer to that shit bob for

1205
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:29,500
all of her life well i'm what

1206
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:30,820
i'm talking about she's grown it out

1207
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:33,130
now yeah sure and she's just kinda

1208
00:44:33,130 --> 00:44:34,780
like she's learned to be free and

1209
00:44:34,810 --> 00:44:37,570
mores they're going like i want to

1210
00:44:37,570 --> 00:44:38,800
be the father of a baby with

1211
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:39,280
you

1212
00:44:40,930 --> 00:44:43,690
i want to be the father i

1213
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:46,450
chose a moisturizing routine that gets results

1214
00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:48,190
i saw you know she's getting older

1215
00:44:48,190 --> 00:44:51,250
and women in on tvn not want

1216
00:44:51,250 --> 00:44:53,440
to look their best and this is

1217
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:55,270
just a thoughtful gift that i would

1218
00:44:55,270 --> 00:44:56,680
take your woman on tv if you're

1219
00:44:56,710 --> 00:44:58,180
out there oh my god however only

1220
00:44:58,200 --> 00:44:59,470
scenes what if you're not you still

1221
00:44:59,470 --> 00:45:00,310
want to look your best but i

1222
00:45:00,310 --> 00:45:00,460
would

1223
00:45:00,460 --> 00:45:02,620
just say you know this isn't i

1224
00:45:02,620 --> 00:45:04,060
think you'll look beautiful but i thought

1225
00:45:04,150 --> 00:45:05,950
you'd enjoy these set of creams

1226
00:45:07,330 --> 00:45:09,670
and then paul pick all picked singing

1227
00:45:09,670 --> 00:45:11,680
lessons and why is that well when

1228
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:14,050
she concluded her show which i don't

1229
00:45:14,050 --> 00:45:15,520
remember what the name of it was

1230
00:45:16,060 --> 00:45:18,850
she famous news know she was she

1231
00:45:18,850 --> 00:45:20,440
had her own show that was not

1232
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:23,320
the news no just sincerity she went

1233
00:45:23,770 --> 00:45:25,120
with a little account of it yeah

1234
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:27,340
she went out on the

1235
00:45:27,340 --> 00:45:29,170
last episode singing a sort of torch

1236
00:45:29,170 --> 00:45:31,450
song by a grand piano she's wearing

1237
00:45:31,450 --> 00:45:33,130
a gown doing like the slinky number

1238
00:45:33,370 --> 00:45:35,050
and she can't sing so it's a

1239
00:45:35,050 --> 00:45:36,640
slam her you would give her singleness

1240
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:38,710
it's just remember that it's labour your

1241
00:45:38,710 --> 00:45:40,960
last episode it's like wouldn't you like

1242
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:42,670
to be able to sing your final

1243
00:45:42,670 --> 00:45:44,680
episode which was obviously hard enough for

1244
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:46,660
you that you were being canceled well

1245
00:45:46,690 --> 00:45:47,500
i'm gonna bring that

1246
00:45:47,530 --> 00:45:49,150
up by saying you need some lessons

1247
00:45:49,150 --> 00:45:51,220
as well well i guess i mean

1248
00:45:51,220 --> 00:45:52,420
it shows that i pay more attention

1249
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:53,710
than to not know what her hairstyle

1250
00:45:53,710 --> 00:45:55,330
was for the entire time she's been

1251
00:45:55,330 --> 00:45:57,580
on tv com okay i think i

1252
00:45:57,580 --> 00:45:58,060
win this one

1253
00:45:59,110 --> 00:46:01,540
yeah i agree all right now i'm

1254
00:46:01,540 --> 00:46:04,900
the host and still having to pick

1255
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:06,880
one i'm doris no but then the

1256
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:09,657
captain no no gift d card yesterday

1257
00:46:10,030 --> 00:46:13,660
ok jeremy renner oh boy wouldn't have

00:46:13,660 --> 00:46:15,220
an ad we keep adding two more

1259

to our pack we always have fun

1260
00:46:16,570 --> 00:46:18,100

00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:19,180
right yeah i'm

1262
00:46:19,255 --> 00:46:20,380
