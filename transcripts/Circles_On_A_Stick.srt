00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:32,940
i don't know so sometimes these guys

59
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:34,320

62
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:38,640
ten

63
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:44,400
that's stupid but she is stunning and

64
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,540
it does make you think what the

65
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:48,090
fuck happened her face what what could

66
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:49,980
have been so bad that just the

67
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:53,610
tiniest imperceptible change made her like come

68
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:54,720
out and say like hey guys this

69
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,910
is gonna finally i have a theorem

70
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:59,280
do you think that she did a

71
00:02:59,280 --> 00:02:59,850
little

72
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:02,430
but somewhere there and there was like

73
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:03,810
a settle down period where she was

74
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:05,190
like oh no i look fucked up

75
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:07,741
and then it like all settled down

76
00:03:07,741 --> 00:03:09,180
she realize oh i'm fine maybe there's

77
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:10,770
such a strange settle down period it

78
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:12,180
takes like six months or something and

79
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:13,860
a lot of people who get it

80
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,390
don't want to not work those six

81
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:18,570
months so there's like one movie like

82
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:20,160
nicole kidman for instance which she's

83
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:21,870
in the movie nine and she just

84
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:24,750
looks so weird nine which is one

85
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:25,740
less than a dime by the way

86
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,800
and the nine-tenths and then she looks

87
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,420
then after that she looks fine because

88
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:32,640
like all settles down yeah kidman is

89
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,490
so beautiful yes and in the beautiful

90
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:38,010
ishi and in the undoing she has

91
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:39,660
a lot of lip work going on

92
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:40,320
that i found

93
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,900
and unnecessary i don't think it's yeah

94
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,760

95
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,290

135
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:10,680
to

136

flight attendant yeah oh so yeah it's

137
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:15,870
like riverdale and yeah it does have

138
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:18,450
it has a sort of specific tone

139
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,920
yes i don't think i'd get ever

140
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,690
watched riverdale because apparently there was a

141
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:23,280
drug on that show called jingle jangle

142
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:26,100
and that's only know these big time

143
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,660
movie yeah and i can't i can't

144
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:28,920
do that but here's the thing about

145
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,090
nicole one of those guys is going

146
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:31,200
to buy our house

147
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:34,530
and he backed jingle jangle yes um

148
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:38,520
the ah nicole kidman there were times

149
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:41,460
where i could not figure out what

150
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:43,620
she was human

151
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:45,810
i cannot figure out what she was

152
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:46,170
human

153
00:05:46,864 --> 00:05:49,500
i'm saying she was thinking yes what

154
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,082
she was trying to express oh yeah

155
00:05:52,082 --> 00:05:53,910
album with the too much filler and

156
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:56,430
so it's it's really problematic and i

157
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:58,230
watched it on the bachelorette and stuff

158
00:05:58,290 --> 00:05:59,400
i don't know if i mentioned this

159
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,810
when we did that no who would

160
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:03,240
who added on the bachelorette that walker's

161
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:06,960
here claire she can't hear to see

162
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,120
be quiet there's what it is i

163
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:11,910
first of all chocolate cake from redness

164
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:13,830
it's not even a judgment on people

165
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:15,960
because i feel like it's doctors who

166
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,460
say like you could dump their angst

167
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,930
i had friends who have been told

168
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:20,790
they've been sort of coerced into doing

169
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:22,440
more than they thought oh yeah because

170
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,820
they're like oh you could probably get

171
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:24,922
this stuff why not do it and

172
00:06:24,922 --> 00:06:26,670
you want to please the nice doctor

173
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,950
like you know also telling your faces

174
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:30,660
fucked up yeah do you like see

175
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:31,770
i don't know if it's like ccs

176
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:33,570
about hooks like do do one hundred

177
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:34,860
more over here and they'll be you

178
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:36,150
know oh yeah and then it's like

179
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:37,500
too much and i feel like with

180
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,870
claire she is very pretty and she

181
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:41,550
got too much and it's you show

182
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:43,110
her her forehead doesn't move at all

183
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,780
and then when she's crying you're thinking

184
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,220
she's crazy because

185

the person who asked the question was

227
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:11,520
tradition they were like asking her like

228
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:13,590
do you ever find that you knew

229
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:16,260
when you watching yourself on screen basically

230
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,000
long-winded way of asking

231
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:21,390
you're getting old well how does your

232
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,337
how does it feel like no and

233
00:08:23,337 --> 00:08:24,960
why don't you do any work was

234
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,750
asking in betting yeah oh so insulted

235
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:28,890
but it was like they were trying

236
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:30,180
to be really feel when you watched

237
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:32,280
the grifters and your nude and you

238
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:35,100
look so amazing and she said she

239
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:37,950
was like i think i get swept

240
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:38,100
away

241
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,240
buy a story when i'm not thinking

242
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,830
about the work that the actor has

243
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:42,540
had done and i want to tell

244
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:45,090
beyond play honest characters who are able

245
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:47,220
to express everything and so i actively

246
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:48,480
don't do any of that stuff because

247
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,650
i really want well that's the thing

248
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:51,060
when you're playing a character how many

249
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:53,280
characters can really afford to get plastic

250
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:54,900
that much i always think about it

251
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:57,090
during shows because you're going okay either

252
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:58,320
this character got like

253
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,690
like a full facelift well it's like

254
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,100
i think about the joke the jim

255
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,990
gaffigan has a lot about he was

256
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:06,780
watching baucus ah yeah hotplug is definitely

257
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,130
out trump is bad

258
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:11,850
no about how i think he was

259
00:09:11,850 --> 00:09:13,620
watching monsters ball and he's like well

260
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:14,700
why don't you just move to l

261
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:15,900
a and be a model like you

262
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:17,760
can be highly bearing i remember

263
00:09:19,564 --> 00:09:22,980
it's like let's say you know it's

264
00:09:23,077 --> 00:09:24,690
the plastic surgery thing is really tough

265
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:27,750
because i you know i think like

266
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,492
we judge it so as a society

267
00:09:29,492 --> 00:09:31,800
we're judged so harshly we we we

268
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,150
demand it but then we judge it

269
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:34,380
so hard it's so fucked up because

270
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:36,420
it's like everyone's everyone is expected to

271
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:37,525

272
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:38,745

707
00:24:55,610 --> 00:24:59,810
four sitcoms it was for sitcoms that

708
00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:02,780
did not last it was working the

709
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:06,380
single guy boston common and i can't

710
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:09,020
remember before i was working gordon was

711
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:10,010
admiring oh hey

712
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,110
she was savage but that was when

713
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:13,370
we all first got to know her

714
00:25:13,837 --> 00:25:15,530
little was on acre love that show

715
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:16,760
so when i became friends with orden

716
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:17,630
he was like oh my god i

717
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:18,710
love working i was a good show

718
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:20,960
i remember it started as a regular

719
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,270
sitcom and then got like mehta yes

720
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:24,590
a few episodes in and it was

721
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:26,930
really funny right dana gould talks about

722
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:27,860
that show because he was on it

723
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:29,495
for a while he brought it on

724
00:25:29,495 --> 00:25:30,170
and around which

725
00:25:30,209 --> 00:25:31,910
is how yeah they're friends yeah his

726
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:33,680
character did not make any sense from

727
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:35,720
episode to episode right like it one

728
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,700
one one week you'd be super smart

729
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:39,350
the next week he'd be super dumb

730
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:41,300
like there was zero consistency that sounds

731
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:43,093
like dana that's pretty fun you know

732
00:25:43,131 --> 00:25:45,590
you're right you're just writing to his

733
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:47,840
strengths but i remember watching shows and

734
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,240
not enjoying them and feeling very bad

735
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:54,200
in common i remember that show i

736

viv gets replaced three seasons in not

761
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:53,300
even then many wasn't it i think

762
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:55,280
it was after the third but it

763
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,930
went six or something like that i'm

764
00:26:56,930 --> 00:26:57,890
not sure i might have been even

765
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,450
earlier but she's

766
00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:02,390
but the original viv for anyone who

767
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:04,310
grew up watching that show is dove

768
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:05,420
it you know i mean like you

769
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:08,060
just that she's amazing original live and

770
00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:10,490
new viv perfectly fine just doesn't have

771
00:27:10,610 --> 00:27:14,090
that all viv has exactly and there

772
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:17,090
was like a whole apparently behind the

773
00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:19,430
scenes drama with her and then

774
00:27:19,670 --> 00:27:21,020
kind of ended up being that she

775
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:23,630
got sort of like blacklisted and sort

776
00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:25,880
of seen as crazy or too difficult

777
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,260
to work with difficult and then she

778
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:29,030
wrote about him in her book and

779
00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:31,730
and i feel like she is reaches

780
00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:33,350
yeah she'll look a pretty crazy youtube

781
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:34,640
thing couple years ago that was like

782
00:27:34,670 --> 00:27:36,740
a rant about this thing but then

783
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:38,750
he and it was an unboxing video

784
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:39,020
which was

785
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:40,940
so where she went to the suicide

786
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:42,830
forest and saw the my god

787
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:44,990
that was so horrible

788
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:48,770
um but we'll sit down with the

789
00:27:48,770 --> 00:27:50,480
actress in the special so they have

790
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:52,730
first time and okay five years and

791
00:27:52,730 --> 00:27:54,260
the whole cast their onset and they

792
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:55,250
like do a whole thing that's really

793
00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:57,140
sweet and then he separately speaks to

794
00:27:57,170 --> 00:28:00,110
the first amphibian and they have this

795
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:02,180
really nice conversation and she basically says

796
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:04,790
like you made it so that like

797
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:05,450
i couldn't work

798
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:07,400
and with that i think he was

799
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,660
like a teenager he had never done

800
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:11,000
anything it was his first thing and

801
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,860
it was so his mouth was aligns

802
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:14,300
of his co-stars like it wasn't some

803
00:28:14,330 --> 00:28:16,100
expert to his credit he took he

804
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:17,390
sat there and took it and took

805
00:28:17,390 --> 00:28:19,160
responsibility and said i was young i

806
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:22,160
was scared all the time i and

807
00:28:22,190 --> 00:28:23,990
apologized like you did really well and

808
00:28:23,990 --> 00:28:25,640
we were she explained oh i want

809
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:25,730
to

810
00:28:25,850 --> 00:28:27,110
if you're gonna say but she explained

811
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,630
that for the first time that ah

812
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:32,897
now because it's about the fresh prince

813
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:36,440
you actually know interesting she care she

814
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,990
explained that she was like really depressing

815
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:40,850
and then abusive relationship and she had

816
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:42,080
recently had a baby and she was

817
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,850
going through mostly her stuff and so

818
00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:44,960
she might have been not fun to

819
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,270
be around but she didn't really talk

820
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:49,280
to anyone but no one like esther

821
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:50,480
said like hey

822
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,370
everything okay they just kind of like

823
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:54,650
she was she was acting weird and

824
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:56,660
different so they ostracized her and fired

825
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:58,550
her that's honestly a question that people

826
00:28:58,550 --> 00:29:01,130

to sit there and wait sorry are

838
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:23,122
these these are the same thing because

839
00:29:23,122 --> 00:29:23,930
she has this show

840
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:25,310
oh right table talk is really great

841
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:26,660
it's three generations of women in the

842
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:29,060
family talking about issues and this gnomes

843
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:30,410
have guests on and then they had

844
00:29:30,410 --> 00:29:32,150
will on and they did a sort

845
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:34,760
of big fuckin moment where they talked

846
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,890
about their all these rumors about their

847
00:29:36,890 --> 00:29:38,899
marriage right oh right i saw this

848
00:29:38,899 --> 00:29:41,270
stuff talks about her infidelity rhine valley

849
00:29:41,270 --> 00:29:42,410
and it was kind of i'd heard

850
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:44,090
it was not letting her

851
00:29:44,690 --> 00:29:45,650
off the hook with some of it

852
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:47,330
i my opinion which i didn't like

853
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,280
because i was like dude we don't

854
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,780
show us this i should have let

855
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:51,890
her off the hook about it we'll

856
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:54,170
know more and feel it yeah okay

857
00:29:54,530 --> 00:29:55,910
like they had already gone they already

858
00:29:55,910 --> 00:29:57,457
dealt with this for many years like

859
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,520
and then i felt like he was

860
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:01,940
letting her sort of like keep apologizing

861
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:03,710
keep saying what she did wrong right

862
00:30:04,370 --> 00:30:06,230
which would she which they had indicated

863
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:08,060
that that had already taken place i

864
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:10,370
think any priors infidelity in marriage the

865
00:30:10,610 --> 00:30:13,400
responsible party should apologize once the other

866
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,748
person has to accept it and then

867
00:30:14,748 --> 00:30:15,890
it just never brought up again that

868
00:30:15,890 --> 00:30:19,550
seems like a way better so but

869
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:20,900
i don't know if their therapy thing

870
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:22,340
as a separate thing oh i don't

871
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:23,750
know anyway but but

872
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:26,810
e heat cool up was saying like

873
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,340
oh he obviously is like gone through

874
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:30,320
some work in that regard because he

875
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,390
likes sat there and took it pretty

876
00:30:32,390 --> 00:30:33,800
much in a responsible way he didn't

877
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,780
take all the responsibility which i thought

878
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:37,460
was kind of like if you're the

879
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:39,830
superstar maybe you take one hundred percent

880
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:43,220
of those possibility ah for the aunt

881
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:44,570
viv stuff yes right you know

882
00:30:45,428 --> 00:30:47,470
if you're like if you're worth one

883
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:50,050
hundred million two hundred and five thousand

884
00:30:50,050 --> 00:30:52,030
dollars and she hasn't worked maybe accept

885
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:54,490
every bit of the responsibility and well

886
00:30:54,493 --> 00:30:56,200
especially if you were if you were

887
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:59,590
essentially a kid who shot to fame

888
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:03,550
practically overnight like i think you as

889
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:05,170
as a grown man you can then

890
00:31:05,170 --> 00:31:05,410
say

891
00:31:05,410 --> 00:31:06,910
say yeah i didn't know what i

892
00:31:06,910 --> 00:31:08,226
was doing i was an asshole and

893
00:31:08,226 --> 00:31:09,700
yeah i'm sorry when she did he

894
00:31:09,730 --> 00:31:11,830
yeah he definitely did i just see

895
00:31:11,890 --> 00:31:13,480
my buyer part yes part of that

896
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:15,340
conversation is not but you have to

897
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:17,410
admit yes you and she did this

898
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:18,520
to his to be fair what are

899
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:20,620
you talking about do that i just

900
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:22,510
think that he allowed her to take

901
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:25,090
some of the responsibility she was talking

902
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:25,570
right and

903
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,275
he never stepped in and said no

904
00:31:27,275 --> 00:31:28,930
no no no don't yeah don't take

905
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:31,060
this it's not you yeah i deserve

00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:33,100
all the blame and when you watch

miserable to work with when everybody else

921
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:06,130
was was having a

922
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,010
everybody here is having a good time

923
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:12,760
you know and it's funny that even

924
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:16,720
knowing like later or even like people

925
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,880
were i apologizing at the time like

926
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:21,940
this person is going through something clearly

927
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:24,100
blah blah blah and it's like but

928
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:27,130
it also feels like it's not the

929
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:27,490
play

930
00:32:27,490 --> 00:32:29,950
race of the people who are subordinate

931
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,890
to say to the person maybe all

932
00:32:32,890 --> 00:32:35,560
the power are you okay yeah you

933
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:37,300
know what i mean no it's it's

934
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:38,440
tough when you're in charge of a

935
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:41,620
thing like the comedy bang bang show

936
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:43,630
you are a sensibly everyone's possible though

937
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:45,760
i didn't have hiring or firing power

938
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,140
that was the production company

939
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:52,180
um but yeah you're sensibly everyone's boss

940
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,740
it's your right no one can come

941
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:54,580
up to you and go like is

942
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:57,250
everything okay and and you're under in

943
00:32:57,250 --> 00:32:59,200
production it will but maybe that's just

944
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,300
like any job you're under such a

945
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:04,960
results oriented schedule of like you have

946
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:07,060
to get this done otherwise all of

947
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:07,750
these millions of

948
00:33:07,810 --> 00:33:10,390
dollars are wasted it feels like it's

949
00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:13,600
on the pier in your case there

950
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:14,980
wasn't really someone who was doing the

951
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:15,970
same things as you but like if

952
00:33:15,970 --> 00:33:18,070
there was an actor and another actor

953
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:21,700
could say are you okay yeah right

954
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:23,200
yeah because it's like the only person

955
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,880
who could really say that yes and

956
00:33:25,150 --> 00:33:26,500
it could be that the producer of

957
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:27,790
the show asked if he was okay

958
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:27,970
like

959
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,710
i i don't know you know but

960
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:32,620
it was i also feel like if

961
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:34,630
you are that person and i've been

962
00:33:34,630 --> 00:33:36,940
the person who is sensibly in charge

963
00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:38,980
at times and i look i have

964
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:41,890
ah i get frustrated and i can

965
00:33:41,890 --> 00:33:43,570
shut down and stuff like that but

966
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,100
i'm also the type of person that

967
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:48,130
can say hey everybody i'm sorry

968
00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:49,840
i'm having a hard time with this

969
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:51,160
you know what i mean like that

970
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,570
yeah i call it out that makes

971
00:33:52,570 --> 00:33:54,820
it somebody can just acknowledge a thing

972
00:33:54,850 --> 00:33:56,440
and say i know this is a

973
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:57,670
drag i know i'm being a drag

974
00:33:57,670 --> 00:33:59,140
right now i'm just having a hard

975
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:01,240
time with this thing getting this to

976
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:03,610
work you know whatever it is but

977
00:34:03,670 --> 00:34:06,430
to just not acknowledge to be to

978
00:34:06,430 --> 00:34:08,290
be miserable every day

979
00:34:08,290 --> 00:34:11,080
day you know without any acknowledgement of

980
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:13,213
it but everyone else is not miserable

981
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:14,560
but i do think we are going

982
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,270
through something personal it's different than being

983
00:34:16,270 --> 00:34:17,740
like oh i'm frustrated with this task

984
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:19,330
that we can't of course i'm slightly

985
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:21,370
you don't want to say because yeah

986
00:34:21,370 --> 00:34:23,650
it's like what ever i never say

987
00:34:23,650 --> 00:34:25,690
no and everyone on the crew knows

988
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:27,010
no there should be like there should

989
00:34:27,010 --> 00:34:28,450
be one friend on every

990
00:34:28,450 --> 00:34:31,720
i said thanks that they hired and

991
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,280
that you that like a sort of

992
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,640
entourage your st vinny had it right

993
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:38,680
in and eighteen in he was sitting

994
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:40,150
here there was no drama in his

995
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:41,560
life because he had three bros to

it was one interesting season where he

1004
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:02,020
went through some struggles and then they

1005
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:03,700
were like i was watching do that

1006
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:03,970

a good time and not be all

1009
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:10,120
depressed but i was watching this particular

1010
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:11,470
episode he was on the tonight show

1011
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:14,680
or something and oh yeah supposedly yea

1012
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:16,150
we mean any yes someone in the

1013
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:18,070
bathroom or in the last guy on

1014
00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:20,740
the show it's somebody going very poorly

1015
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:22,480
and it's like he's the exact same

1016
00:35:22,930 --> 00:35:24,130
he's already different he's

1017
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,410
not any different yeah he was fine

1018
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,630

1019
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:30,670
told me yeah he's on coke and

1020
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:31,870
he's fucking up his life i'm like

1021
00:35:31,870 --> 00:35:33,790
yes he seems exactly the same as

1022
00:35:33,790 --> 00:35:36,610
the last i saw the show well

1023
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:38,800
maybe it's not the fault of the

1024
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:39,370
writing

1025
00:35:40,570 --> 00:35:42,880

in every job in every job we

1031
00:35:56,230 --> 00:35:58,540
could all every job at all reach

1032
00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:00,340
out to our coworkers

1033
00:36:00,610 --> 00:36:02,590
if they're frustrated and just say hey

1034
00:36:02,650 --> 00:36:05,470
everything going okay yeah and just see

1035
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:07,360
true although she's out show business the

1036
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:08,830
only job where you can get away

1037
00:36:08,830 --> 00:36:11,020
with that where you can be like

1038
00:36:11,023 --> 00:36:14,230
an unpleasant person oh yeah well i

1039
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:16,030
know other jobs you have to be

1040
00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:17,503
like the boss do you know what

1041
00:36:17,503 --> 00:36:19,180
i mean or you have to be

1042
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:20,770
you have to be unpleasant to

1043
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:24,460
somebody who's a lateral well in hospitals

1044
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:26,800
like doctors to nurses and stuff like

1045
00:36:26,857 --> 00:36:30,070
they have a god complex true i

1046
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:30,550

1047
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:33,400

1052
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:50,470
scott that you know is if you

1053
00:36:50,470 --> 00:36:52,000
watched a lot of that very similar

1054
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,830
to show business to me like there's

1055
00:36:53,830 --> 00:36:56,260
a hierarchy and where the doctors are

1056
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:57,280
kind of like the stars of the

1057
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,630
show and they get to treat there's

1058
00:36:58,630 --> 00:37:01,570
an operating theatre yes and there are

1059
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,070
p h o yep

1060
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:06,910
i find the term p a confusing

1061
00:37:06,910 --> 00:37:10,450
because it is used for so many

1062
00:37:10,450 --> 00:37:13,510
different things yeah yes and all assistant

1063
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:15,400

00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:19,690
yes haw peer approved fizz what is

1065
00:37:19,690 --> 00:37:23,440
it with physician's assistant okay and other

1066
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:27,610
necessary pieces piano set for piss ass

1067
00:37:30,130 --> 00:37:31,030
in his ass

1068
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,060
we're gonna need to hire three piss

1069
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:34,390
acids

1070
00:37:36,730 --> 00:37:38,680
it would be so funny to train

1071
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:40,450
someone coming up she was gone i

1072
00:37:40,450 --> 00:37:42,370
got a job as their play on

1073
00:37:42,370 --> 00:37:44,620
the pitch when they're like doctor if

1074
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:45,190
someone hurt

1075
00:37:47,110 --> 00:37:48,190
so you hire a bunch of p

1076
00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:49,450
a's and they don't know anything about

1077
00:37:49,450 --> 00:37:51,070
show business and you tell them that

1078
00:37:51,070 --> 00:37:54,220
npa stands for business and they go

1079
00:37:54,250 --> 00:37:56,620
through their entire career thinking it's piss

1080
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:58,840
ass and then they start calling plays

1081
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,130
pissed like i was a piss ass

1082
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:00,753
for like five

1083
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:04,630
i worked my way up oh that

1084
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:05,470

i could do that no just for

1087
00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:12,850
that reason to make people call themselves

1088
00:38:12,850 --> 00:38:14,680
a pizzo yeah only reason

1089
00:38:15,790 --> 00:38:17,080

00:38:19,690 --> 00:38:20,710
that's what you you're going to be

1092
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:22,600
you shouldn't have a job and that's

1093
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,250
why you're gonna be yeah i just

1094
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:26,950
love the way you gotta li

1095
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:32,170
shouldn't every person doing have foxworthy shouldn't

1096
00:38:32,170 --> 00:38:33,460

00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:55,480
have they really some of these songs

1139
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:57,670
i'm like you've never heard this well

1140
00:39:57,850 --> 00:39:59,039
isn't it the case that one of

1141
00:39:59,050 --> 00:40:00,400
em maybe has heard it and brings

1142
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,390
it to the other i don't know

1143
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:04,210
but they also they also get requests

1144
00:40:04,270 --> 00:40:05,440
so it's like phil comrades in the

1145
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:06,820
air tonight that we're going to see

1146
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:08,787
a world where you're like their fifth

1147
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,270

1148
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:12,490
is there ever yeah once i didn't

1149
00:40:12,490 --> 00:40:14,170
say they'd never heard of any saw

1150
00:40:14,590 --> 00:40:16,208
scott you're trying to put origin but

1151
00:40:16,283 --> 00:40:17,680
i do think the concept not really

1152
00:40:17,704 --> 00:40:20,440
doctor it's very cute it's a very

1153
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:22,570
cute concept but it's like this should

1154
00:40:22,570 --> 00:40:23,650
be one video max

1155
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:28,180
everyone wants to monetize every fun thing

1156
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:31,180
that's true i do too so every

1157
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:33,100
person gets one show and they you

1158
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:34,990
can save it until you're you really

1159
00:40:34,990 --> 00:40:36,250
feel like you have a good idea

1160
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,950
what if you die yeah if you

1161
00:40:38,950 --> 00:40:40,060
die before you get to do it

1162
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:41,320
you have to donate your money to

1163
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:43,210
a cause you don't like so it

1164
00:40:43,210 --> 00:40:44,050
kind of gives you this

1165
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:46,990
sort of impetus so like what cuts

1166
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:50,710
don't like like why you don't something

1167
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:53,380
like antiabortion yeah something you're against and

1168
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:56,560
then you then so you know i

1169
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,180
better get this die to get this

1170
00:40:58,180 --> 00:41:00,400
done so to take long and so

1171
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,290
you kind of some people dude squander

1172
00:41:02,290 --> 00:41:03,700
it early because they care about peta

1173
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:04,690
i have to get this done before

1174
00:41:05,375 --> 00:41:08,015
yeah yeah so like if you're if

1175
00:41:08,015 --> 00:41:10,025

00:41:11,915 --> 00:41:13,655
you gotta make your shush child if

1178
00:41:13,655 --> 00:41:16,715
your make-a-wish child you or your pilot

1179
00:41:16,715 --> 00:41:18,635
is yeah it's like it's just like

1180
00:41:18,635 --> 00:41:19,925
anyone else i mean like you have

1181
00:41:20,135 --> 00:41:22,055
your wish is separate of that shirt

1182
00:41:22,055 --> 00:41:23,495
no you get your wish okay so

1183
00:41:23,495 --> 00:41:24,665
let's really break down one of the

1184
00:41:25,085 --> 00:41:25,445
children

1185
00:41:25,685 --> 00:41:27,395
what if your make-a-wish is to not

1186
00:41:27,395 --> 00:41:28,865
make the presentation and keep the money

1187
00:41:29,225 --> 00:41:32,907
whoa that only works once wait once

1188
00:41:32,915 --> 00:41:35,105
in your life chose one one kid

1189
00:41:36,335 --> 00:41:39,335
and and whoever's everything everything's first yeah

1190
00:41:39,425 --> 00:41:40,985
and then maybe then they do that

1191
00:41:41,405 --> 00:41:42,605
ah we had to make a wish

1192
00:41:42,605 --> 00:41:45,845
clause yeah exactly and if and if

1193
00:41:45,845 --> 00:41:47,645
that kid dies then another kid turns

1194
00:41:47,645 --> 00:41:49,925
into that kid oh this is good

1195
00:41:49,955 --> 00:41:51,575
oh i love that so it's what

1196
00:41:51,575 --> 00:41:54,365
freaky friday know it's the make-a-wish clause

1197
00:41:55,595 --> 00:41:59,075
ah because what good is dead they

1198
00:41:59,075 --> 00:42:02,315
don't trade places yeah yeah but that

1199
00:42:02,345 --> 00:42:03,785
wait how am i dad are they

1200
00:42:03,785 --> 00:42:05,795

p

1203
00:42:10,985 --> 00:42:12,935
but that is essentially trading places because

1204
00:42:12,965 --> 00:42:15,755

1205
00:42:15,875 --> 00:42:17,675

the beautiful voice who is deaf and

1312
00:46:11,075 --> 00:46:12,815
he find first of all when i

1313
00:46:12,815 --> 00:46:13,805
was a kid i was really confused

1314
00:46:13,805 --> 00:46:15,575
by this maybe because they

1315
00:46:15,755 --> 00:46:17,225
show a scene where they take he

1316
00:46:17,225 --> 00:46:18,635
takes his son to a parade and

1317
00:46:18,635 --> 00:46:20,705
there's these fire trucks going by with

1318
00:46:20,705 --> 00:46:22,625
really loud sirens and all these kids

1319
00:46:22,625 --> 00:46:23,825
are crying in his kid is not

1320
00:46:24,275 --> 00:46:26,285
looking at his watch but i thought

1321
00:46:26,765 --> 00:46:28,415
he went deaf from that i didn't

1322
00:46:28,415 --> 00:46:33,665
know ah ah and then in very

1323
00:46:33,695 --> 00:46:35,585
calmly wet so this gave you a

1324
00:46:35,585 --> 00:46:35,855
fear

1325
00:46:35,885 --> 00:46:37,925
of firetrucks i just didn't get it

1326
00:46:37,925 --> 00:46:39,395
i was like that's the explanation for

1327
00:46:39,395 --> 00:46:42,965
why he's deaf and then ah because

1328
00:46:42,965 --> 00:46:45,305
he's just the first step that burnt

1329
00:46:45,305 --> 00:46:46,955
know what's the name mr hollande figures

1330
00:46:46,955 --> 00:46:48,815
out that his son is deaf that's

1331
00:46:48,815 --> 00:46:51,035
how they initially figured out oh because

1332
00:46:51,035 --> 00:46:52,415
he's a baby and he's a baby

1333
00:46:52,415 --> 00:46:55,985
say okay got it and he um

1334
00:46:56,045 --> 00:46:57,785
shoving his baby why aren't you crying

1335
00:46:58,925 --> 00:47:00,273
but this is a wicker stay you

1336
00:47:00,273 --> 00:47:03,365
too good for this so he then

1337
00:47:03,365 --> 00:47:04,445
he's a teacher by the way i've

1338
00:47:04,445 --> 00:47:05,465
only seen this like once and it

1339
00:47:05,465 --> 00:47:07,985
was yeah this is like nineties or

1340
00:47:07,985 --> 00:47:11,082
something he's like a profess he's like

1341
00:47:11,082 --> 00:47:13,325
come what does it conductor music guy

1342
00:47:13,325 --> 00:47:15,575
orchestra teacher and then he teaches all

1343
00:47:15,575 --> 00:47:17,315
these things and then his son grows

1344
00:47:17,315 --> 00:47:18,995
up she's older things and

1345
00:47:19,415 --> 00:47:22,535

1346
00:47:22,895 --> 00:47:25,610
two and when he's grown up he's

1347
00:47:25,955 --> 00:47:28,325

1348
00:47:28,325 --> 00:47:30,255

finally leaves her to her new life

1372
00:48:10,385 --> 00:48:12,335

00:48:13,625 --> 00:48:14,555

1408
00:49:17,945 --> 00:49:19,415
of filmmaking

1409
00:49:20,075 --> 00:49:22,445
when big event movies didn't have to

1410
00:49:22,445 --> 00:49:24,395
have like huge concepts they were just

1411
00:49:24,395 --> 00:49:27,095
like you love this guy he's going

00:49:27,095 --> 00:49:29,045
to do something fucking crazy yes movie

1413
00:49:29,045 --> 00:49:30,815
you know being that simple is what

1414
00:49:30,815 --> 00:49:32,825
makes it so good yeah like just

1415
00:49:32,825 --> 00:49:34,895
this character and then the beginning i

1416
00:49:34,895 --> 00:49:36,155
mean it's a really fun movie too

1417
00:49:36,155 --> 00:49:37,775
because he's i forgot everything about it

1418
00:49:37,775 --> 00:49:38,855
and he's like an kind of a

1419
00:49:39,035 --> 00:49:40,085
jerk a bit

1420
00:49:40,205 --> 00:49:42,125
at his job he's like really specific

1421
00:49:42,125 --> 00:49:43,595
about how we didn't watch the jerk

1422
00:49:45,155 --> 00:49:46,985
he's got that pingpong gas station or

1423
00:49:46,985 --> 00:49:50,045
something he hasn't mentioned with glasses because

1424
00:49:50,045 --> 00:49:52,115
everyone's eyes cross someone shot motor oil

1425
00:49:53,345 --> 00:49:55,175
no but i mean you realize is

1426
00:49:55,175 --> 00:49:56,375
like it's like he's like working on

1427
00:49:56,375 --> 00:49:57,485
the schedule and life is all about

1428
00:49:57,485 --> 00:49:58,732
getting packages right on time i love

1429
00:49:58,835 --> 00:50:00,695
above and then he's like nothing to

1430
00:50:00,695 --> 00:50:02,615
do for four years sub stay alive

1431
00:50:02,675 --> 00:50:04,745
oh another thing i didn't get that

1432
00:50:04,745 --> 00:50:06,365
i did that because that jogged my

1433
00:50:06,365 --> 00:50:07,928
memory of ah that whole thing with

1434
00:50:07,955 --> 00:50:10,475
the deaf kid i didn't when i

1435
00:50:10,475 --> 00:50:11,825
was just watching castaway i kind of

1436
00:50:11,825 --> 00:50:13,232
didn't get something that was happening

1437
00:50:13,370 --> 00:50:14,043
i a little bit later i was

1438
00:50:14,043 --> 00:50:14,855
like oh my god i'm so stupid

1439
00:50:15,245 --> 00:50:17,375
so there's a part where he may

1440
00:50:17,375 --> 00:50:20,105
all agree he like he's at the

1441
00:50:20,105 --> 00:50:22,565
end of his you know fucking role

1442
00:50:22,565 --> 00:50:23,405
i was gonna say rope but then

1443
00:50:23,405 --> 00:50:24,335
he has to go get this rope

1444
00:50:24,335 --> 00:50:25,835
so he's because he's trying to use

1445
00:50:25,835 --> 00:50:27,095
trying to offer them so no but

1446
00:50:27,095 --> 00:50:29,165
that's that's not so i think they

1447
00:50:29,225 --> 00:50:31,205

00:50:59,045 --> 00:51:01,145
up a rope with a perfect new

1465
00:51:01,145 --> 00:51:01,295

1466
00:51:01,295 --> 00:51:03,065

1467
00:51:03,065 --> 00:51:05,195
log on it and in my head

1468
00:51:05,285 --> 00:51:06,785
he now he tried to kill him

1469
00:51:06,785 --> 00:51:08,795
yeah of course he was testing it

1470
00:51:09,065 --> 00:51:10,865
with this log but in my head

1471
00:51:10,865 --> 00:51:13,265
i go that last so crazy at

1472
00:51:13,275 --> 00:51:15,365
this summer that there was this new

1473
00:51:15,365 --> 00:51:18,305
saw on the island from like previous

1474
00:51:18,365 --> 00:51:19,685
so what did they cut up or

1475
00:51:19,699 --> 00:51:20,555
did they cut out

1476
00:51:22,155 --> 00:51:24,435
ever attempt suicide oh video you just

1477
00:51:24,435 --> 00:51:26,424
see that he pulls on disney baby

1478
00:51:26,424 --> 00:51:29,235
you guys okay i don't think no

1479
00:51:29,235 --> 00:51:30,855
i don't remember i remember there was

1480
00:51:30,855 --> 00:51:32,985
there have been something cut from the

1481
00:51:32,985 --> 00:51:34,815
beginning of the when they shot i've

1482
00:51:34,815 --> 00:51:37,215
been maybe a deleted they initially show

1483
00:51:37,215 --> 00:51:40,275
him it's weird that the volleyballs name

1484
00:51:40,275 --> 00:51:41,595
is wilson and his wife's name is

1485
00:51:41,595 --> 00:51:42,285
well i my

1486
00:51:42,315 --> 00:51:43,755
theory is that he needed to be

1487
00:51:43,755 --> 00:51:45,675
named wilson because he has a strong

1488
00:51:45,705 --> 00:51:48,045
connection he call her wilson he got

1489
00:51:48,045 --> 00:51:50,355
home he called the ball rita and

1490
00:51:50,355 --> 00:51:50,745
he calls

1491
00:51:52,575 --> 00:51:55,305
he calls his balls volunteer rita and

1492
00:51:55,305 --> 00:51:58,335
wilson oh um also it's the name

1493
00:51:58,335 --> 00:52:01,298
of the company's sports sports coach well

1494
00:52:01,455 --> 00:52:02,715
nobody said it had to be a

1495
00:52:02,715 --> 00:52:05,445
wilson ball because every character that he's

1496
00:52:05,445 --> 00:52:07,697
ever worked with any any any character

1497
00:52:07,697 --> 00:52:09,285
they become as close within a film

1498
00:52:09,465 --> 00:52:11,115
he has to have either the middle

1499
00:52:11,115 --> 00:52:11,895
name wilson or

1500
00:52:12,045 --> 00:52:14,855
huh sounds are free but right now

1501
00:52:14,865 --> 00:52:17,685
the way i'm thinking about volleyballs remember

1502
00:52:18,075 --> 00:52:20,205
that interview inside the extra studio but

1503
00:52:20,205 --> 00:52:21,765
he talked about this because he feels

1504
00:52:21,765 --> 00:52:22,755
like he's cheating if you know

1505
00:52:24,015 --> 00:52:25,755
it's like a kirk cameron thing what's

1506
00:52:25,755 --> 00:52:28,965
that because he's so religious he can't

1507
00:52:28,965 --> 00:52:32,471
kiss other actresses on screen oh so

1508
00:52:32,537 --> 00:52:34,995
he married his coworker them his wife

1509
00:52:35,175 --> 00:52:37,935
yeah oh and the public not getting

1510
00:52:37,935 --> 00:52:39,915
to see him fucking mad i watched

1511
00:52:39,915 --> 00:52:41,325
so his wife will always be will

1512
00:52:41,325 --> 00:52:43,245
always double for the kissing scene oh

1513
00:52:43,245 --> 00:52:43,755
so

1514
00:52:44,475 --> 00:52:46,875
that's that's really funny i watched she's

1515
00:52:46,875 --> 00:52:48,105
trying to hire her to kiss her

1516
00:52:48,105 --> 00:52:50,445
on edge oh and sushi and then

1517
00:52:50,445 --> 00:52:52,005
she has this woman for you

1518
00:52:53,085 --> 00:52:55,395
yeah where he stands in for her

1519
00:52:56,625 --> 00:52:59,115
okay you're gonna take either when i

1520
00:52:59,115 --> 00:53:00,135
didn't see this loophole coming

1521
00:53:03,945 --> 00:53:05,895

1530
00:53:28,905 --> 00:53:30,375
sure you know paul rust is in

1531
00:53:30,375 --> 00:53:32,355
inglorious basterds that's a little trivia i

1532
00:53:32,355 --> 00:53:34,545
know i've never seen it but um

1533
00:53:34,545 --> 00:53:36,213
your little trivia i know male masters

1534
00:53:36,220 --> 00:53:38,240
olden correctly but the trivia i know

1535
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:40,125
so brad pitt is in it he

1536
00:53:40,965 --> 00:53:43,755
quentin tarantino's supposedly like a script was

1537
00:53:43,815 --> 00:53:46,635
nine years old it wrong and he

1538
00:53:46,665 --> 00:53:46,845
clay

1539
00:53:46,845 --> 00:53:48,645
named her man juicy that i've heard

1540
00:53:48,645 --> 00:53:50,805
scripts are rife with spelling yes and

1541
00:53:50,805 --> 00:53:52,005
he was like that's because both words

1542
00:53:52,005 --> 00:53:54,765
are spelled wrong right i believe he

1543
00:53:54,765 --> 00:53:56,205
didn't know how to spell those words

1544
00:53:56,235 --> 00:53:58,245
but i think okay yeah everybody is

1545
00:53:58,245 --> 00:54:00,105
someone we all know boy that's the

1546
00:54:00,105 --> 00:54:01,935
truth could be a real live person

1547
00:54:01,935 --> 00:54:04,095
or fictional fictional character as long as

1548
00:54:04,095 --> 00:54:06,975
they're fairly ubiquitous each player is assigned

1549
00:54:07,005 --> 00:54:08,535
their celebrity by the person to their

1550
00:54:08,535 --> 00:54:10,905
left it's a secret usually write it

1551
00:54:10,905 --> 00:54:11,985
on a post-it and put it on

1552
00:54:11,985 --> 00:54:14,445
the player's forehead then everybody takes turns

1553
00:54:14,445 --> 00:54:16,275
asking yes or no questions about who

1554
00:54:16,275 --> 00:54:18,075
they are nobody can ask the same

1555
00:54:18,075 --> 00:54:20,325
question as someone else did per rotation

1556
00:54:20,595 --> 00:54:22,515
for instance if lawrence asks am i

1557
00:54:22,515 --> 00:54:23,895

1558
00:54:23,895 --> 00:54:25,125

disney character weird yeah that should be

1840
01:07:27,625 --> 01:07:30,265

1849
01:07:45,752 --> 01:07:47,695
but it's funny and definitely but the

1850
01:07:47,696 --> 01:07:49,645
powerful thing like he has more powers

1851
01:07:49,645 --> 01:07:51,475
than a human being does right but

1852
01:07:51,475 --> 01:07:52,735

have this together entourage really is one

2067
01:15:54,580 --> 01:15:56,440
of those special shows that isn't funny

2068
01:15:56,440 --> 01:15:58,210
and isn't dramatic so you're right

2069
01:15:58,270 --> 01:16:00,070
but supposed to be funny but also

2070
01:16:00,100 --> 01:16:01,960
i don't care about the drama yes

2071
01:16:02,200 --> 01:16:03,370

2072
01:16:03,370 --> 01:16:05,440
coming from but well i like it

2073
01:16:05,440 --> 01:16:07,267

character that we were referring i know

2075
01:16:08,710 --> 01:16:10,330
i know now in retrospect that paul

2076
01:16:10,330 --> 01:16:11,650
was referring to it for real so

2077
01:16:11,680 --> 01:16:12,700
to answer the call to try to

2078
01:16:12,700 --> 01:16:14,470
figure out what a show is by

2079
01:16:15,010 --> 01:16:16,780
hearing it's not a drama not a

2080
01:16:16,780 --> 01:16:18,310
