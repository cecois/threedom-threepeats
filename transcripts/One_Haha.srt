directly next door to them but

79
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,250
but i'm even further but this guy

80
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:22,380
was like really into it so i

81
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:24,270
haven't this is my first noise complaint

82
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:26,160
i've received in years and hours this

83
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,150
year i want i want i want

84
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:30,480
some details he's probably i'm guessing between

85
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,720
three and eighty nine wow and that's

86
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:37,710
a guess as it gets okay so

87
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:38,520
i'm not so

88
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:40,830
he could be to be could be

89
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:42,960
nine my question is more around your

90
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:46,230
age ah probably not he's probably younger

91
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:50,970
it's just very fucking ballsy bowles screams

92
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:53,460
very aggressive it's bolted to peek over

93
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:55,680
offense to whistle at some to whistle

94
00:03:55,682 --> 00:03:57,210
at someone and then to do it

95
00:03:57,210 --> 00:03:58,800
aggressively yeah

96
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,500
and then read the wolf whistle and

97
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,000
then rather than say could you turn

98
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,708
that down to say you want to

99
00:04:04,708 --> 00:04:06,300
turn that down yeah like it like

100
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,160
he's your dad or sansa yeah no

101
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,890
i don't fuck off and then and

102
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:12,480
then when i when i did it

103
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:14,010
any i still hadn't given him a

104
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:15,540

120
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:52,740
trying to have some tiny comfort in

00:04:52,749 --> 00:04:53,790
my miserable existence

122
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:57,270
and i think my girls i feel

123
00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:00,930
like i probably hit the hammer four

again because it wasn't done like and

128
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,280

bang bang from the person that i

204
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:50,160

205
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,960
i very definitely woken up in the

206
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,700
middle of the night who was on

207
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,680
the other side of the wall um

208
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:57,780
and i felt bad about that at

209
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:59,220
the time and then the next day

210
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:00,420
i felt bad that i'd put a

211
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:03,180
whole johnson on and did you hang

212
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:04,860
it up yeah of course i did

213
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:07,500
and didn't like it um i think

214
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,450
he i think he was very good

215
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:10,290
natured about and he thought

216
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,640
it was funny he conceded that it

217
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,440
was funny i he never betrayed that

218
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,060
he was upset that i fuckin put

219
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:15,270
all

220
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,170
oof it was a good spot though

221
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:20,670
you can hang something there very easily

222
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:23,310
yeah had one should keep it what's

223
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:26,880
so what are the worst like neighbors

224
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:29,580
with adjoining walls that you've ever had

225
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:32,790
i can remember one one we had

226
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:35,370
i was living with a girlfriend and

227
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:36,090
she

228
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:39,390
unfortunately gave this older woman who lived

229
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:42,270
underneath us her phone number which is

230
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:44,910
a big mistake because the old lady

231
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:46,770
very nicely was like oh hey what's

232
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:48,120
your phone number in case i ever

233
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,500

we eh

237
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,740
ever we're just talking at ten thirty

238
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:00,240
at night we would get a call

239
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,350
and she'd be like what do you

240
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:03,900

00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:02,040
i've definitely had a lot of bad

271
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,360
neighbors and i'm sure i told the

272
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,530
story of when i thought with my

273
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,830
neighbor about the trash can yes um

274
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:10,170
that was pretty intense but did you

275
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:11,550
get a trading card from him too

276
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:14,220
or it was a woman and oh

277
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:15,390
someone with a trash can was a

278
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:17,760
woman there's egg on my face and

279
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:19,485
you did it i was just remembering

280
00:10:19,485 --> 00:10:20,715
this story from i don't know if

281
00:10:20,715 --> 00:10:21,675
i've ever told you this so when

282
00:10:21,675 --> 00:10:23,115
i was living in chicago in an

283
00:10:23,115 --> 00:10:27,976
apartment um i had to harness me

284
00:10:27,976 --> 00:10:30,255
to pay me and i was it

285
00:10:30,255 --> 00:10:33,345
was a third floor um apartment cope

286
00:10:34,335 --> 00:10:36,560
walk up and we always were coming

287
00:10:36,597 --> 00:10:38,535
going and so we left our apartment

288
00:10:38,535 --> 00:10:41,385
door unlocked all the time not that

289
00:10:41,415 --> 00:10:42,435
there are two doors to get into

290
00:10:42,435 --> 00:10:43,485
the building and then we would just

291
00:10:43,485 --> 00:10:45,045
leave our door open because we always

292
00:10:45,045 --> 00:10:46,815
were there when people come and go

293
00:10:46,815 --> 00:10:48,705
and people coming over whatever and there

294
00:10:48,705 --> 00:10:49,965
was only one other apartment on the

295
00:10:49,965 --> 00:10:52,365
floor so it felt like no real

296
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:52,875
risk

297
00:10:53,955 --> 00:10:56,445
and one day i was not there

298
00:10:56,445 --> 00:10:56,715
but

299
00:10:57,825 --> 00:10:59,325
my friend my one roommate had a

300
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:01,575
guy friend who was visiting and he

301
00:11:01,575 --> 00:11:02,835
was sleeping in her room in the

302
00:11:02,835 --> 00:11:05,355
bed she was at work and my

303
00:11:05,385 --> 00:11:08,535
other friend was um not home i

304
00:11:08,535 --> 00:11:09,525
think it was just that guy was

305
00:11:09,525 --> 00:11:10,425
just there but we left the door

306
00:11:10,425 --> 00:11:11,715
unlocked and that's not that's it we

307
00:11:11,715 --> 00:11:14,565
all did that so whatever he's people

308
00:11:14,565 --> 00:11:16,395
broke into the apartment building walked right

309
00:11:16,395 --> 00:11:17,895
into our apartment and took

310
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:20,805
my roommate's laptop and mine was right

311
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:22,065
next to it they didn't take mine

312
00:11:22,485 --> 00:11:23,925
i think they were running out out

313
00:11:23,925 --> 00:11:26,175
by then and then they the guy

314
00:11:26,175 --> 00:11:27,794
woke up and he like heard the

315
00:11:27,794 --> 00:11:29,265
music kind of yelling but he was

316
00:11:29,265 --> 00:11:30,285
like really small guy like there was

317
00:11:30,285 --> 00:11:31,005
a kind of know you know it

318
00:11:31,005 --> 00:11:32,355
was just like a crazy sort of

319
00:11:32,355 --> 00:11:34,335
moment he was gonna do something and

320
00:11:34,335 --> 00:11:36,105
then he chased after them a little

321
00:11:36,105 --> 00:11:37,245
bit but they ran back down they

322
00:11:37,245 --> 00:11:38,025
ran through the whole apart

323
00:11:38,055 --> 00:11:40,005
and down the back stairs and ran

324
00:11:40,005 --> 00:11:41,475
away and then that night they came

325
00:11:41,475 --> 00:11:44,835
back later whoa because it was mocked

326
00:11:44,865 --> 00:11:47,145
or yeah they tried again so we

327
00:11:47,385 --> 00:11:49,335
we were scared it was stupid we

328
00:11:49,335 --> 00:11:51,735
were scared after that happened so we

329
00:11:51,735 --> 00:11:53,205
had a bunch of friends over and

330
00:11:53,205 --> 00:11:54,555
we were all sitting in and they

331
00:11:54,555 --> 00:11:57,795
started jostling the back door and then

332
00:11:58,005 --> 00:11:58,215
two

333
00:11:58,245 --> 00:11:59,715
guys ran out after them and tried

334
00:11:59,715 --> 00:12:03,405
to get them and um they just

335
00:12:03,405 --> 00:12:05,655

337
00:12:08,716 --> 00:12:10,845

389
00:14:04,965 --> 00:14:07,425
to her place and says um hey

401
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:30,525

would wear what he would just walk

424
00:15:14,235 --> 00:15:16,755
around and he would come up to

425
00:15:16,755 --> 00:15:18,765
me and my friends and i always

426
00:15:18,765 --> 00:15:20,445
would go shopping when i was in

427
00:15:20,445 --> 00:15:21,705
like fifth grade we can't be sure

428
00:15:21,705 --> 00:15:24,435
babies um with by two friends and

429
00:15:24,435 --> 00:15:25,995
he would say three musketeers who'd yelled

430
00:15:25,995 --> 00:15:27,795
us from down the street three musketeers

431
00:15:28,065 --> 00:15:30,045
three musketeers that he'd started and we'd

432
00:15:30,045 --> 00:15:31,095
go like oh no and like

433
00:15:31,215 --> 00:15:32,985
we have taught us got real good

434
00:15:33,018 --> 00:15:33,795
guys get two yours

435
00:15:35,085 --> 00:15:35,955
and then he would come up to

436
00:15:35,955 --> 00:15:37,185
us and be like were you carrying

437
00:15:37,185 --> 00:15:39,735
swords yeah and we had our stupid

438
00:15:39,735 --> 00:15:40,995
feathers in our cabs and he would

439
00:15:40,995 --> 00:15:41,355
always

440
00:15:42,945 --> 00:15:43,965
he would always go on and on

441
00:15:43,965 --> 00:15:44,685
about how you have to wear a

442
00:15:44,685 --> 00:15:45,825
helmet but you could never get away

443
00:15:45,825 --> 00:15:46,785
and we were like ten so you

444
00:15:46,785 --> 00:15:47,955
didn't really really know how to you

445
00:15:47,955 --> 00:15:51,045
know and he would just ah tell

446
00:15:51,045 --> 00:15:51,735
you that you have to wear a

447
00:15:51,735 --> 00:15:53,145
helmet because he think he would tell

448
00:15:53,145 --> 00:15:54,885
his whole accident everything that happened was

449
00:15:54,885 --> 00:15:56,085
kinda living he said and he would

450
00:15:56,085 --> 00:15:57,105
just walk around and tell people about

451
00:15:57,105 --> 00:16:00,135
that oh that's sad that's very soon

452
00:16:00,465 --> 00:16:01,785
but he probably helped a lot of

453
00:16:01,785 --> 00:16:02,115
people

454
00:16:02,985 --> 00:16:05,475
i mean i never forgot helmet awareness

455
00:16:05,655 --> 00:16:08,685
probably was not you know that widespread

456
00:16:08,685 --> 00:16:10,755
back then right and i didn't want

457
00:16:10,755 --> 00:16:11,595
to wear one because i thought it

458
00:16:11,595 --> 00:16:13,515
wasn't cool yeah i mean that's the

459
00:16:13,515 --> 00:16:14,865
prob do you know i didn't like

460
00:16:14,865 --> 00:16:16,335
wearing a bike i did not like

461
00:16:16,335 --> 00:16:18,105

463
00:16:19,335 --> 00:16:20,385
didn't wear a bike helmet for the

464
00:16:20,385 --> 00:16:22,695
longest time um until

465
00:16:22,695 --> 00:16:23,835
bill and i may have told you

466
00:16:23,835 --> 00:16:26,265

467
00:16:26,265 --> 00:16:28,935
got serious and then i realized oh

someday yes yes i if i think

480
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:55,365

00:16:58,815 --> 00:16:59,955
i think i'm on my way to

483
00:16:59,955 --> 00:17:01,275
u c b or something like it

484
00:17:01,275 --> 00:17:02,985
was nelson's eye

485
00:17:03,225 --> 00:17:05,145

486
00:17:05,355 --> 00:17:07,035
its nose before i got to gelson

487
00:17:07,065 --> 00:17:08,955

00:17:12,315 --> 00:17:14,865
and i was riding past the swords

490
00:17:14,865 --> 00:17:16,695
moving back from the microphone like she

491
00:17:16,695 --> 00:17:18,825
will just go on interrupting i'm not

492
00:17:18,825 --> 00:17:19,395
interrupting

493
00:17:22,095 --> 00:17:23,685
she's just in awe of the story

494
00:17:23,685 --> 00:17:25,935
like a pall on a bike i

495
00:17:25,935 --> 00:17:27,225
got to sit back for this one

496
00:17:28,035 --> 00:17:30,525
i'm just letting it be told very

497
00:17:30,525 --> 00:17:32,205
briefly to my goddamn life

498
00:17:33,735 --> 00:17:35,955
do you think the musketeers do you

499
00:17:35,955 --> 00:17:37,695
think they were bummed out by their

500
00:17:37,725 --> 00:17:38,925
dumb hats or do you think they

501
00:17:38,925 --> 00:17:41,265
were proud of them the actual people

502
00:17:41,655 --> 00:17:43,485
yes huh i think they are proud

503
00:17:43,485 --> 00:17:45,285
of them that seems probably very probably

504
00:17:45,285 --> 00:17:46,875
in fashion at the time so things

505
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:48,795
like check these out and and it

506
00:17:48,795 --> 00:17:50,685
was very like eye catching and it

507
00:17:50,685 --> 00:17:53,175
was it was elaborate on fathering them

508
00:17:53,205 --> 00:17:53,415
yeah

509
00:17:53,415 --> 00:17:55,755
and they're and they're super memorable yeah

leather cap yeah

512
00:18:04,935 --> 00:18:06,495
maybe i'll bring back the musketeer hat

513
00:18:07,367 --> 00:18:09,165
it's it is weird when things that

514
00:18:09,165 --> 00:18:10,935
would be super come back into fashion

515
00:18:10,935 --> 00:18:13,515
like platform shoes i did except so

traffic or whatever and they were trying

684
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:08,480
to say and they wanted to jack

685
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,450
your car know as a reprisal he

686
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:13,040

whatever but yeah don't ever coach like

690
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:20,240
good there's fucking crazy people out there

691
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,800
so you gotta keep cool on the

692
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,240
road and it's hard too because i

693
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:25,310
haven't had a bear i've barely driven

694
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:27,920
in a whole year but five minutes

695
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,000
on the road i was like going

696
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:31,250
fuck you screaming go

697
00:24:33,530 --> 00:24:34,760
but i mean for the most part

698
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:36,170
i think i i used to have

699
00:24:36,170 --> 00:24:37,520
way worse road rage and i feel

700
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,380
like now i'm i'll just kind of

701
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:42,260
casually flip people off but beyond that

702
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:43,910
i like take it pretty slow and

703
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:45,440
like let people in and like i'm

704
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,570
not i really don't i think that's

705
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:49,100
the problem with road rages like you're

706
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,900
you are so polite and you let

707
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,340
people in and to see someone who's

708
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:52,430
nah

709
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:54,770
not polite yeah it enrages you yeah

710
00:24:54,770 --> 00:24:56,900
it does therapists i

711
00:24:59,090 --> 00:25:00,920

like how much do you pay your

715
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:07,610

00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:26,720
me and i didn't want to like

725
00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:28,970
accelerate to go through it so you

726
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:31,760

1044
00:36:54,910 --> 00:36:56,860
would say this is representation it's more

1045
00:36:56,890 --> 00:36:59,080
abstract when you say it's abstract it's

1046
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,340
adaption that's and that's what i find

1047
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:02,200
humorous about it and i think too

1048
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:05,140

fairy houses when people build those into

1151
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:38,290
the trees when they put like a

1152
00:40:38,290 --> 00:40:40,720

1156
00:40:48,130 --> 00:40:49,270
like to have one of those on

1157
00:40:49,270 --> 00:40:50,410
a tree like i would like to

1158
00:40:51,185 --> 00:40:52,265
things like that i think that's so

1159
00:40:52,265 --> 00:40:55,775
q to miserable did pippi longstocking have

1160
00:40:55,775 --> 00:40:58,475
a tree like ah ah a hiding

1161
00:40:58,475 --> 00:41:00,005
space in a tree what am i

1162
00:41:00,785 --> 00:41:04,745
lacking common into your world what i

1163
00:41:04,745 --> 00:41:06,815
don't want that that's what it is

1164
00:41:06,905 --> 00:41:08,075
i feel like there there was a

1165
00:41:08,075 --> 00:41:09,845
book i read as a kid with

1166
00:41:09,845 --> 00:41:11,285
a female protagonist who

1167
00:41:11,285 --> 00:41:13,115
i had a secret hiding place in

1168
00:41:13,115 --> 00:41:14,795
the nod of a tree although am

1169
00:41:14,795 --> 00:41:16,145
i thinking of to kill a mockingbird

1170
00:41:16,175 --> 00:41:17,675
i think that's what you're thinking of

1171
00:41:17,705 --> 00:41:19,355
okay i wanted i read your logs

1172
00:41:19,505 --> 00:41:20,944
to be like talking about a singer

1173
00:41:20,945 --> 00:41:21,815
in the back of my head

1174
00:41:23,375 --> 00:41:25,707
that makes sense what what i was

1175
00:41:25,707 --> 00:41:27,035
saying or what she was saying because

1176
00:41:27,215 --> 00:41:28,955
talking at the same time yeah it

1177
00:41:28,955 --> 00:41:30,485
was great i could tune out completely

1178
00:41:30,545 --> 00:41:33,785
i put anger through my hair and

1179
00:41:33,815 --> 00:41:37,055
i made the wired braids yes that's

1180
00:41:37,055 --> 00:41:38,346
the way to do it it's not

1181
00:41:38,346 --> 00:41:41,555
changing i've there i feel like pippi

1182
00:41:41,555 --> 00:41:43,205
longstocking had a thing with a tree

1183
00:41:43,205 --> 00:41:44,045
e but i don't know what it

1184
00:41:44,045 --> 00:41:45,785
was like a secret headquarters in a

1185
00:41:45,785 --> 00:41:47,495
tree and there also by the way

1186
00:41:47,585 --> 00:41:48,845
there was a book series i read

1187
00:41:48,845 --> 00:41:51,635
about people investing about kids investigating crimes

1188
00:41:51,635 --> 00:41:53,405
and they had a secret layer underneath

1189
00:41:53,405 --> 00:41:55,925
a junkyard that was considered hide out

1190
00:41:56,195 --> 00:41:58,445
that fascinated me and i i tried

1191
00:41:58,445 --> 00:42:00,035
to replicate it once when my dad

1192
00:42:00,035 --> 00:42:01,205
dug up a tree in our front

1193
00:42:01,205 --> 00:42:03,365
yard and we did a secret fort

1194
00:42:03,425 --> 00:42:04,925
underneath in the big hole in the

1195
00:42:04,925 --> 00:42:06,365
ground with like a plank of wood

1196
00:42:06,365 --> 00:42:07,595
and put dirt over it and then

1197
00:42:07,595 --> 00:42:09,125
surprise people who would come by by

1198
00:42:09,125 --> 00:42:10,415
jumping out of it so i've always

1199
00:42:10,865 --> 00:42:12,005

1226
00:43:19,985 --> 00:43:20,165
said

1227
00:43:20,195 --> 00:43:21,245
we could make money off of this

1228
00:43:21,275 --> 00:43:23,075
yeah well the heirs to say he

1229
00:43:23,075 --> 00:43:25,115
didn't want out there no he ah

1230
00:43:25,265 --> 00:43:27,785
there's discussion about this he apparently knew

1231
00:43:27,785 --> 00:43:29,075
when he died all this stuff would

1232
00:43:29,075 --> 00:43:30,185
come out and he's fine with it

1233
00:43:30,665 --> 00:43:32,195
and then other people think well no

1234
00:43:32,195 --> 00:43:33,185
he didn't want any of it to

1235
00:43:33,185 --> 00:43:35,915
come out but his state feels that

1236
00:43:36,245 --> 00:43:37,595
he wanted all of this to come

1237
00:43:37,595 --> 00:43:38,855
out and so they're they're putting it

1238
00:43:38,855 --> 00:43:40,235
out but but as he put this

1239
00:43:40,235 --> 00:43:40,325
in

1240
00:43:40,325 --> 00:43:41,405
in writing anywhere

1241
00:43:42,605 --> 00:43:44,195
i know he had no will he

1242
00:43:44,195 --> 00:43:46,685
had no winner that's a big problem

1243
00:43:46,805 --> 00:43:48,485
that's why we all can lay claim

1244
00:43:48,485 --> 00:43:49,895
to anything of his yes

1245
00:43:51,305 --> 00:43:52,205

but the the reason i i preordered

1256
00:44:17,255 --> 00:44:19,115
it is because if you buy the

1257
00:44:19,145 --> 00:44:21,425
super deluxe version it includes a blu

1258
00:44:21,425 --> 00:44:24,305

00:44:35,705 --> 00:44:36,845
this was one i did not see

1266
00:44:39,215 --> 00:44:41,525

she li or the time or sometimes

1269
00:44:45,785 --> 00:44:46,985
no but there was i feel like

1270
00:44:46,985 --> 00:44:48,815
there was always like an extraneous celebrity

1271
00:44:48,815 --> 00:44:49,925
who would show up and get on

1272
00:44:49,925 --> 00:44:52,175
stage for two centers dance during the

1273
00:44:52,205 --> 00:44:53,735
yeah sometimes it was going to

1274
00:44:53,795 --> 00:44:56,795
funny sometimes it was i don't remember

1275
00:44:57,515 --> 00:44:59,015
i think kim kardashian was there once

1276
00:44:59,106 --> 00:45:00,815
yeah yeah dance and then everybody who

1277
00:45:00,815 --> 00:45:02,885
got friends was like or whatever yeah

1278
00:45:02,945 --> 00:45:04,415

that's ah did not already have it

1440
00:51:06,255 --> 00:51:07,965
looks like a civil war hat it

1441
00:51:07,965 --> 00:51:09,735
is it's it from the union navy

1442
00:51:09,735 --> 00:51:11,595
it's a replica of ah reproduction of

1443
00:51:11,595 --> 00:51:14,475
a union navy hat that i came

1444
00:51:14,475 --> 00:51:16,485
across you know like it just got

1445
00:51:16,515 --> 00:51:18,645
stuck in my feed somehow right and

1446
00:51:18,645 --> 00:51:19,875
this is from thing

1447
00:51:19,875 --> 00:51:23,025
instagram ad knows from an instagram mattos

1448
00:51:23,025 --> 00:51:24,915
i was shopping for something else and

1449
00:51:24,915 --> 00:51:27,465
then this popped up some other kind

1450
00:51:27,465 --> 00:51:29,235
of hat or whatever and then for

1451
00:51:29,235 --> 00:51:32,835
some reason i got very paranoid

1452
00:51:34,125 --> 00:51:36,045
that it was a confederate right that

1453
00:51:36,045 --> 00:51:37,215
it was the on the wrong side

1454
00:51:37,215 --> 00:51:38,985
because i saw i saw an officer's

1455
00:51:38,985 --> 00:51:40,935
hat that had the same insignia and

1456
00:51:40,935 --> 00:51:42,135
i was like oh shit what the

1457
00:51:42,135 --> 00:51:43,995
fuck did i do right and so

1458
00:51:43,995 --> 00:51:46,095
i look i was like in bed

1459
00:51:47,325 --> 00:51:49,395
scrolling and searching and trying to find

1460
00:51:49,395 --> 00:51:51,195
like and then i finally

1461
00:51:52,785 --> 00:51:55,035
like fortune in bed

1462
00:51:57,315 --> 00:51:58,365
and then i finally was able to

1463
00:51:58,365 --> 00:52:00,165
confirm that it was the correct side

1464
00:52:00,525 --> 00:52:03,555
ah yeah you stamped it out that's

1465
00:52:03,555 --> 00:52:05,565

last time i remember wearing it was

1495
00:53:04,875 --> 00:53:07,395
to jimmy paros podcast thumb when he

1496
00:53:07,395 --> 00:53:10,515
was still doing it at what stage

1497
00:53:10,665 --> 00:53:12,825
nothing stuff by party jimmy pesto flipper

1498
00:53:14,595 --> 00:53:17,325
it's very hard to say and um

1499
00:53:17,685 --> 00:53:18,825
so i wore it because it was

1500
00:53:18,825 --> 00:53:19,965
around christmas time and so i wore

1501
00:53:19,965 --> 00:53:21,915
this you know sort of dickensian christmas

1502
00:53:21,915 --> 00:53:24,885
outfit to show yeah i remember this

1503
00:53:25,155 --> 00:53:27,825
and ah and then i never saw

00:53:27,825 --> 00:53:29,385
it again and i don't know what

1505
00:53:29,385 --> 00:53:31,785
happened to it and my sneaking suspicion

1506
00:53:31,785 --> 00:53:33,015
is you sat on it and became

1507
00:53:33,015 --> 00:53:33,645
a normal hat

1508
00:53:34,725 --> 00:53:37,695
yeah became normal and i can look

1509
00:53:37,846 --> 00:53:40,575
right at it flat pancake black hat

1510
00:53:40,935 --> 00:53:41,865
i think i ate it i think

1511
00:53:41,955 --> 00:53:43,748
points zero upon it and i was

1512
00:53:43,748 --> 00:53:44,983
like this thing because bird but it's

1513
00:53:44,983 --> 00:53:45,465

1514
00:53:46,785 --> 00:53:50,295
