by the way there are probably four

208
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,560
people in our texts never done a

209
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,300
word who must i think of them

210
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:46,470
now every single time we do in

211
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:48,780
like waking up going fucking lie getting

212
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:50,370
the like the muted us you know

213
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:51,750
what sucks about meeting on your phone

214
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:53,310
you can mute the do not disturb

215
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:56,130
on that that thread however it still

216
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:58,050
tells you you have a mistake and

217
00:07:58,050 --> 00:07:59,403
they seem as well i don't think

218
00:07:59,403 --> 00:07:59,760
you should

219
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:01,260
sigh oh i don't think shitty i

220
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:02,460
hope that they get them and go

221
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:04,140
god bless these guys are still doing

222
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:05,310
it i love that they go while

223
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:07,470
they're all live you know yeah in

224
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:08,610
a way we don't know if these

225
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:09,930
people are alive is proof of lying

226
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:10,890
but i do feel like we should

227
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:13,110
probably stop it soon you're the one

228
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:14,400
who started it i know they i

229
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,290
remember but here's what i'm thinking because

230
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:18,360
john was started by saying let's i'll

231
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,860
do this and compete with each other

232
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:21,540
yeah yeah and and in a way

233
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:23,070
it was great to keep elegant fun

234
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:25,080
for a while and there's still like

235
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,510
it i still why don't i enjoy

236
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:27,930
just like it but here's what i

237
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:31,170
would think but tall john said when

238
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:32,940
he got he didn't get it right

239
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:34,980
he got x out of six he

240
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:36,480
said he was gonna quit buster and

241
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,550
then he didn't quit let's write because

242
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:39,900
we reward him i think

243
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,060
whoever every time one of us get

244
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:43,380
doesn't get it you have to stop

245
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:45,990
sending beauty playing we just kept sending

246
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:48,870
it and then eventually it'll well it'll

247
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:51,090
go down yeah you liked everyone sends

248
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:53,970
it yeah i do i don't dislike

249
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:55,140
that everyone sends it i'm just i'm

250
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:57,120
ready for it to wind down yeah

251
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:58,710
if it stopped for life to wind

252
00:08:58,710 --> 00:08:59,160
down soon

253
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:03,630
okay that's upsetting judy's well with another

254
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:04,560
thirty years or so

255
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,870
i was like oh we want like

257
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,010
why just slapped wonder how do you

258
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:12,660
feel about aging like how long would

259
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:14,190
you like to live do you feel

260
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:15,380
like there's a cutoff where it's like

261
00:09:15,427 --> 00:09:16,650
well i don't want to live that

262
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:18,240
long just talking to my mom about

263
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,350
this the other day and she said

264
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:22,530
that sometimes talking your mom to oh

265
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:25,290
shit she said someone at our church

266
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:25,920
said ab

267
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,560
after eighty it's just basically game over

268
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:29,670
like it's all down and i don't

269
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:31,290
believe that i don't believe that enough

270
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:33,300
for everyone exactly the same frame i

271
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,250
mean look at william shatner who

272
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:37,920
space the final okay

273
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:41,400
like there's a lot of people who

274
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:43,380
have a lot of energy passed up

275
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,110
yeah like like ah he was doing

276
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,060
shit your dad says at like eighty

277
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:49,590
two or something like that you know

278
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:51,150
and he's still kicking around ninety or

279
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:52,500
whatever it's like i'm sure it's fine

280
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,510
for some people but i think people

281
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:57,810
have also of my parents' generation you

282
00:09:57,810 --> 00:09:59,040
know i think i told you that

283
00:09:59,040 --> 00:09:59,250
my

284
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,870
dad had an over the hill party

285
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:02,940
at forty yeah where it was like

286
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:05,370
here's here's you know your cane old

287
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:07,110
man yeah stuff like that so she

288
00:10:07,116 --> 00:10:09,540
truly was like a lot of people

289
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:11,490
that they knew you know died at

290
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:14,400
forty five or fifty really yeah so

291
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:17,370
yeah so anyway i remember like having

292
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:19,110
a heart attack at fifty seemed like

293
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:19,440
a

294
00:10:20,125 --> 00:10:21,133
i'm and say i was like yeah

295
00:10:21,145 --> 00:10:22,135
unlikely quebec it was the thing that

296
00:10:22,135 --> 00:10:23,365
was going to happen but look here's

297
00:10:23,365 --> 00:10:24,385
the other thing i've been watching a

298
00:10:24,385 --> 00:10:26,815
lot of old movies recently everyone smokes

299
00:10:26,965 --> 00:10:28,345
and then oh yeah and so it's

300
00:10:28,345 --> 00:10:29,815
like a yeah the more you see

301
00:10:29,815 --> 00:10:30,865
that the more you go like oh

302
00:10:30,865 --> 00:10:32,785
of course everyone was having yes and

303
00:10:32,785 --> 00:10:34,585
fifty they're all killing themselves and each

304
00:10:34,585 --> 00:10:37,255
other yeah yeah yeah so um i

305
00:10:37,645 --> 00:10:39,145
i feel like it is a quality

306
00:10:39,145 --> 00:10:39,895
of life thing

307
00:10:40,465 --> 00:10:43,885
um where if i'm if i'm still

308
00:10:44,005 --> 00:10:45,205
look i want to live as long

309
00:10:45,205 --> 00:10:46,945
as i can if i'm still doing

310
00:10:46,945 --> 00:10:48,385
good san juan mean i wanna live

311
00:10:48,385 --> 00:10:49,795
as long as i can yeah i

312
00:10:49,795 --> 00:10:52,345
don't feel like it's it's wild to

313
00:10:52,345 --> 00:10:55,375
me the idea although i know it

314
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:57,595
is for some people to get to

315
00:10:57,595 --> 00:10:59,665
that point like my mother went into

316
00:10:59,665 --> 00:11:00,445
hospice care before

317
00:11:00,445 --> 00:11:02,575
she died that was her decision like

318
00:11:02,575 --> 00:11:05,395
she went off of dialysis because of

319
00:11:05,425 --> 00:11:07,135
other issues that she had and the

320
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:10,015
doctor's like if you keep doing this

321
00:11:10,015 --> 00:11:10,975
your quality of life is going to

322
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:12,475
get worse and worse or you could

323
00:11:12,475 --> 00:11:13,525
do this and let nature take its

324
00:11:13,525 --> 00:11:15,115
course and she did it and like

325
00:11:15,145 --> 00:11:16,585
and i may have i feel like

326
00:11:16,585 --> 00:11:17,875
now i've talked about this on here

327
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:20,605
before murder mariah so but the idea

328
00:11:20,665 --> 00:11:22,825
of being able to say like i've

329
00:11:22,825 --> 00:11:24,805
lived enough life like that's i can

330
00:11:24,835 --> 00:11:26,635
i can let go is like because

331
00:11:26,665 --> 00:11:27,805
where i am in life right now

332
00:11:27,805 --> 00:11:30,325
is like climbing like please let yeah

333
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:32,335
yeah live it seems like something that

334
00:11:32,335 --> 00:11:33,475
i don't know that i'd be able

335
00:11:33,475 --> 00:11:35,095
to exist like oh no this has

336
00:11:35,095 --> 00:11:37,705
been good yeah ma yeah but then

337
00:11:37,705 --> 00:11:39,145
i guess if you do live long

338
00:11:39,145 --> 00:11:40,495
enough if you make it to your

339
00:11:40,525 --> 00:11:40,765
age

340
00:11:40,765 --> 00:11:42,085
s or whatever you will be a

341
00:11:42,085 --> 00:11:44,665
better judge of what constitutes a life

342
00:11:44,665 --> 00:11:47,185
lived yeah well as my father said

343
00:11:47,185 --> 00:11:49,765
someone said to him like something like

344
00:11:49,795 --> 00:11:51,445
oh it's seventy it's all kind of

345
00:11:51,445 --> 00:11:54,145
over whatever and he's like yeah i'll

346
00:11:54,145 --> 00:11:56,005
talk to you when you're seventy you

347
00:11:56,005 --> 00:11:58,135
know yeah it's like it doesn't really

348
00:11:58,135 --> 00:11:59,725
feel that way yeah everyone just wants

349
00:11:59,725 --> 00:12:00,925
to smoke spots yeah

350
00:12:01,225 --> 00:12:04,255
much younger inside yeah it's so true

351
00:12:04,285 --> 00:12:06,175
what a cruel trick that fate plays

352
00:12:06,355 --> 00:12:08,815
really is horrible i lately even think

353
00:12:08,825 --> 00:12:10,615
about it a lot we're just see

354
00:12:10,615 --> 00:12:12,055
someone walking in a struggle they're gonna

355
00:12:12,055 --> 00:12:12,355
die

356
00:12:13,645 --> 00:12:17,035
ah i'm not really happy about it

357
00:12:17,065 --> 00:12:18,385
it's like my brain's been doing that

358
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:20,095
for me where i'm just going like

359
00:12:20,695 --> 00:12:22,405
on that person has a whole life

360
00:12:22,405 --> 00:12:24,085
and then that's gonna end or something

361
00:12:24,115 --> 00:12:25,525
so i just say oh god it

362
00:12:25,555 --> 00:12:27,685
is i'm just beginning to feel the

363
00:12:27,685 --> 00:12:28,825
thing of

364
00:12:30,145 --> 00:12:33,445
feeling younger inside than my body is

365
00:12:33,775 --> 00:12:34,675
like the last time we did a

366
00:12:34,675 --> 00:12:36,835
show and then there was a scene

367
00:12:36,835 --> 00:12:39,115
where you died and you just collapsed

368
00:12:39,115 --> 00:12:40,585
on the floor yeah and then i

369
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:43,045
then later there was a mirroring of

471
00:15:45,985 --> 00:15:46,735

fine but yeah aging aging stuff if

478
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:05,095
you could stop aging at what age

479
00:16:05,095 --> 00:16:07,795
would you like physically because some video

480
00:16:07,795 --> 00:16:09,175
ho you know how when you look

481
00:16:09,175 --> 00:16:10,915
at like you you feel old when

you're not cool

652
00:21:56,730 --> 00:21:59,700

653
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:01,710
their work friends are just so uncool

654
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:04,950

655
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:07,380
job by guys you're just like oh

656
00:22:07,384 --> 00:22:08,910
and why that retail jobs where i

657
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:10,200
liked a lot of the people children

658
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,520
maybe a little different because you're all

659
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:14,280
about the same retails pretty cool i

660
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:16,140
don't like my waiting table jobs unless

661
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:16,890
it was in the middle

662
00:22:16,890 --> 00:22:17,760
out of nowhere it was a bunch

663
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,440
of old ladies in may most of

664
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,030
the time is like young kids that

665
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:22,320
you would maybe hang out with but

666
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:23,550
but like if you're working in an

667
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:26,850
office job everyone around you sucks right

668
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,830
so you gotta you gotta figure out

669
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:29,940
ways to get out there and meet

670
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:31,410
people in other areas but i think

671
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:32,850
the internet has made this so much

672
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:35,610
easier that there are now like get

673
00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:37,050
together kind of things

674
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:38,610
is that you can go well there

675
00:22:38,610 --> 00:22:40,440
is an app to make friends yeah

676
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:41,580
so when i oh it's like you're

677
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:43,470
saying it's like tinder for friends or

678
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:45,780
something i think that it was like

679
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:46,770
i heard about that i thought that

680
00:22:46,770 --> 00:22:49,440
was the sweetest nicest thing um are

681
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,360
generally swim lay around and be like

682
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,940
no thank these churches yeah i think

683
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,860
i think that would i would not

684
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:57,210
put passing them i don't know

685
00:22:57,210 --> 00:22:59,100
add up your mind mister option using

686
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:00,090
one of those apps because you can

687
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:02,490
make a friend and mechanical and then

688
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:05,340
i feel like it's tough because it's

689
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:07,890
like if you have one friend maybe

690
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:09,150
it's like if you have one friend

691
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:10,530
you asked them to bring another friend

692
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:11,812
when you hang out or some yeah

693
00:23:11,812 --> 00:23:13,800
yeah hey time and row the group

694
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:16,860
anxiety yay yeah all thirty yeah also

695
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:17,370
by the way you

696
00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:18,810
you can as a woman you can

697
00:23:18,810 --> 00:23:20,430
go to a bar you're speaking as

698
00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:21,840
shows so what are you gonna tell

699
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:22,800
me i can do you can go

700
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,300
to a bar and meet a million

701
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:27,300
people that is not true yeah go

702
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:28,500
to a bar so you to belong

703
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:29,970
to everyone will start talking no yeah

704
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:30,990
no one wants to

705
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:34,860
read ma'am i think you would maybe

706
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:37,560
sign up for an activity like trivia

707
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:39,630
night or something like that or like

708
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,130
but it's hard to cool alone to

709
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:42,690
things like i think you'll like what

710
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:43,890
do you like like knitting or something

711
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:45,090
like with something that's kind of a

712
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:46,620
solo activity that you could take a

713
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:49,350
class and meet people yeah there's i

714
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:51,690
feel like what's good about one of

715
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:52,170
the things that is

716
00:23:52,170 --> 00:23:53,400
is good about the internet is that

717
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,350
it's easier to connect with people now

718
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:56,700
than it ever has been you can

719
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:59,310
find those sorts of places to go

720
00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:00,600
where there's going to be groups of

721
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,820
like-minded people that you can at least

722
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:04,950
you will have a a jumping off

723
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:06,840
point for a conversation like it's like

724
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,160
you all like the same tv show

725
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,420
or you all like you know some

726
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:10,950
kind of game or something i once

727
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:12,090
went to a band

728
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:16,140
alone and meet a concert a concert

729
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:19,050
yeah and i started talking to someone

730
00:24:19,050 --> 00:24:21,630
because i thought i recognize them and

731
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:24,330
realized quickly that it wasn't the person

732
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:25,380
i thought of but we struck up

733
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:27,600
a conversation it's it's that easy i

734
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:29,280
just think it's funny because we both

735
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:32,070
have the interest of this band yeah

736
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:32,490
yeah

737
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:34,560
yeah i mean you know it's it's

738
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,820
a really hard thing though because i

739
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:37,050
think so many of my friendships were

740
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:38,760
just made from doing improperly and i

741
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,860
know just naturally met people and yeah

742
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,390
but i've i was very lucky to

743
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:43,440
have that because i always think when

744
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,640
i moved to new york i moved

745
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,990
to la and i had that as

746
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:47,940
like a thing i was doing but

747
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:48,750
a number of class if you don't

748
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:50,040
think that sucks you might not if

749
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:50,893
you listen to this you might think

750
00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:51,990
perhaps fun you could take an improv

751
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:52,380
class

752
00:24:52,770 --> 00:24:54,690
i've never been upset at someone who

753
00:24:54,690 --> 00:24:57,030
just starts a conversation though well i

754
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:59,250
mean they're well that's true but yeah

755
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:00,990
those you know any normal who just

756
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:02,130
someone i don't know who's just like

757
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:04,890
you chatting yeah chatting with another alone

758
00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:06,030
person i also think the other thing

759
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:06,960
is you have to say yes to

760
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,100
a lot of opportunities like if you

761
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:09,360
get invited to a party you have

762
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,170
to go even if you don't like

763
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:12,120
the move last man yeah you know

764
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:12,810
because i would just

765
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:13,980
not want to do that random movie

766
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:16,050
yes man just watch that do what's

767
00:25:16,066 --> 00:25:17,610
like hanging out with friends yeah jim

00:25:17,610 --> 00:25:19,410
carrey different guys struck up a conversation

with me on an airplane which normally

770
00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:23,100
i would hate but and i do

771
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:24,210
not like it we started talking to

773
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:27,240

still have the card yeah also have

792
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:04,680
a baby and bring it to a

793
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:07,890
park or a dog have a dog

794
00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:09,540
baby well it's interesting i think get

795
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:10,620
on the news that baby has a

796
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:12,870
baby riding a dog a wide yard

797
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:13,290
or p

798
00:26:13,290 --> 00:26:14,490
people constantly coming up to you and

799
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:15,990
talk no not at all i'm no

800
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:17,280
no one's doing that um i also

801
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,540
think covert plays a role with that

802
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:20,850
too but like guy thing covert plays

803
00:26:20,878 --> 00:26:23,640
around sneezing and having people spaces now

804
00:26:23,670 --> 00:26:25,230
maybe this for you a person who's

805
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:26,430
listening i don't know anything about you

806
00:26:26,430 --> 00:26:28,110
maybe you have a pet maybe i

807
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:30,810
would dumb but like getting together with

808
00:26:30,810 --> 00:26:32,580
someone who also has a baby is

809
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:33,391
a thing where it's like you kind

810
00:26:33,391 --> 00:26:33,450
of

811
00:26:33,487 --> 00:26:36,150
make friends like i'm making friends solely

812
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:38,160
based on that i mean yeah and

813
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,751
it's like that's not something i do

814
00:26:39,751 --> 00:26:40,920
in my life like seek out new

815
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,030
people to hang out with and like

816
00:26:42,090 --> 00:26:43,414
make a plan and go to it's

817
00:26:43,414 --> 00:26:44,820
like that's usually a lot of effort

818
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:46,290
for me i was just i like

819
00:26:46,290 --> 00:26:48,420
to just hang out usually it seems

820
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:49,440
like all the friends that i made

821
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,790
in my life where like okay i

822
00:26:50,819 --> 00:26:53,610
graduate college and then i was

823
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:55,830
they were all work friends until i

824
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:57,330
started doing comedy and then they became

825
00:26:57,330 --> 00:26:59,190
all comedy friends right so it's like

826
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:01,080
if if the people at your job

827
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:02,760
end up sucking which they probably will

828
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,050
but maybe they won't you know maybe

829
00:27:04,050 --> 00:27:05,460
they won't maybe maybe this person is

830
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:07,710
gonna work somewhere like relatively cool or

831
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:09,480
something like yeah i'm like happy whole

832
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:11,910
really tesla like something like that like

833
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:13,560
be friends with you on mosque where

834
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:13,770
are you

835
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:16,140
you might meet someone who's like minded

836
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:17,880
because you're both interested in the job

837
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:18,690
and then you can hang out in

838
00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:20,160
goods yeah but then you have to

839
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,030
ask people to hang out and that

840
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:22,260
sucks and it's hard but you do

841
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:25,080
it it's true like getting that's why

842
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:26,700
i think if you can if you

843
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:28,620
can get yourself into a situation where

844
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:30,960
there is something that you all have

845
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,520
in common that draws you there whether

846
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:33,930
it's a trivia night or whatever

847
00:27:33,930 --> 00:27:36,360
are themed around something than at least

848
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:38,250
you have an icebreaker there's something you

849
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:40,050
could definitely use to start a com

850
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,000
if you have a job where there's

851
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:44,220
five people who would go to a

852
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:46,350
trivia game with you invite all of

853
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:47,760
them even if you don't like them

854
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:50,700
too will be like fuck this and

855
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:53,130
fuck you yeah and then you'll weed

856
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:54,090
them out

857
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:55,650
if anyone says fuck you i ain't

858
00:27:55,650 --> 00:27:59,460
they're not negative perception people in offices

859
00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:01,500
yeah because maybe they're cool did you

860
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,449
ever worked in an office yeah but

861
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:05,130
like working a warehouse of one where

862
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:07,230
the warehouse for example your office an

863
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:08,490
office and i've met met yeah and

864
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:10,170
they're all there yeah and they are

865
00:28:10,170 --> 00:28:12,150
friends with each other but yeah maybe

866
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:14,160
the problem is you buck that

867
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:18,150
ah um but basing friends around your

868
00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:20,040
common interests is really good because it

869
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,360
gives you something to talk about and

870
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,380
then whenever there's like a thing that

871
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:24,030
comes up you can go do togethers

872
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:25,860
where if if it's music it's like

somewhere and you can go do that

877
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:34,410

1152
00:38:09,390 --> 00:38:11,520
in a way yeah yeah you know

1153
00:38:11,730 --> 00:38:13,710
um so yeah those were

1154
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:15,660
but but but that was never explained

1155
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:16,950
to me so until i was like

1156
00:38:16,950 --> 00:38:18,390

you yeah they hid everything from me

1159
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:24,300
parents lie and lauren i'm sorry but

1160
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:25,470
you're gonna end up lying too but

1161
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:26,880
who already am who you say the

1162
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:27,510
side

1163
00:38:28,590 --> 00:38:29,850
ooh is like a baby all the

1164
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:31,560
time who is to decide what they're

1165
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,030
going to be called well just narrowly

1166
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:37,290
side i mean my family now that

1167
00:38:37,290 --> 00:38:39,390
my grandparent you know the grandparents of

1168
00:38:39,390 --> 00:38:41,460
my child have decided that what they

1169
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:42,990
want to be called yes but i

1170
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:44,610
don't know if that was how that

1171
00:38:44,610 --> 00:38:46,950
always went like i don't know i

1172
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:48,750
mean i think that's more current yeah

1173
00:38:48,846 --> 00:38:50,190
i think it is and i think

1174
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:52,320
that it also you can decide what

1175
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,850
you want to be called but then

1176
00:38:54,030 --> 00:38:55,380
ultimately it's kind of up to the

1177
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:57,180
baby what the baby ends up being

1178
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:59,040
able to pronounce right well that's true

1179
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:00,840
like like some of the names that

1180
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:02,310
we use now are based on my

1181
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:05,550
nephew could say exactly yeah my sister

1182
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:08,910

people like oh

1212
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:20,400

the other languages are not being dubbed

1370
00:46:23,855 --> 00:46:26,675

1375
00:46:33,155 --> 00:46:35,615
yeah alright and your debate begins now

1376
00:46:36,065 --> 00:46:37,205
alright so i went down to the

1377
00:46:37,235 --> 00:46:38,675
city center the other day and you

1378
00:46:38,675 --> 00:46:40,835
know what everywhere i looked there was

1379
00:46:40,835 --> 00:46:42,155
a koala and i was like this

1380
00:46:42,155 --> 00:46:44,315
is so cute i showed them to

1381
00:46:44,315 --> 00:46:45,755
my kids i showed them to my

1382
00:46:45,755 --> 00:46:48,845
grandparents and nothing in between and i

1383
00:46:48,845 --> 00:46:51,185
thought that you know there's a perfect

1384
00:46:51,185 --> 00:46:52,685
amount of quality here right now because

1385
00:46:52,685 --> 00:46:55,295
if there were less koalas and that's

1386
00:46:55,295 --> 00:46:57,365
your time mister mom is like completely

1387
00:46:57,365 --> 00:46:59,675
i disagree obviously not only because i

1388
00:46:59,675 --> 00:47:01,565
was told to but because actually i

1389
00:47:01,595 --> 00:47:03,245
think there are too many koalas in

1390
00:47:03,245 --> 00:47:05,285
the city centre i cannot go shopping

1391
00:47:05,285 --> 00:47:06,515
without one of them crawling into my

1392
00:47:06,515 --> 00:47:08,310
shopping bag and biting my hand giving

1393
00:47:08,310 --> 00:47:10,985
me clomid i will not live this

1394
00:47:10,985 --> 00:47:12,935
way i don't want anyone to be

1395
00:47:12,935 --> 00:47:16,295
at risk they spread illness and they

1396
00:47:17,255 --> 00:47:17,509
and

1397
00:47:17,525 --> 00:47:18,155

00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:21,605

when you just talked about how you

1403
00:47:29,795 --> 00:47:32,495

1404
00:47:32,735 --> 00:47:34,505
that no men would have sex with

1405
00:47:34,505 --> 00:47:36,515

to die she wouldn't so amendment fire

1415
00:47:56,435 --> 00:47:58,175
no one believes you obviously know everyone

1416
00:47:58,175 --> 00:47:59,525
plays to fire

1417
00:47:59,525 --> 00:48:01,505
yeah no one should be getting up

1418
00:48:01,505 --> 00:48:06,215
because yeah okay anyway i thought it

1419
00:48:06,215 --> 00:48:07,595
was really strange that you just kissed

1420
00:48:07,595 --> 00:48:09,545
me right then you have chlamydia i

1421
00:48:09,545 --> 00:48:12,245
don't want it like it's just it's

1422
00:48:12,275 --> 00:48:14,135
it's unprofessional first of all during a

1423
00:48:14,135 --> 00:48:16,205
debate we're supposed to be on opposite

1424
00:48:16,205 --> 00:48:17,615
sides i was trying to prove a

1425
00:48:17,615 --> 00:48:19,655
point regarding the ways in

1426
00:48:19,685 --> 00:48:21,905
which i am a great kisser now

1427
00:48:21,905 --> 00:48:23,585
let me count the ways okay used

1428
00:48:23,585 --> 00:48:24,365
way too much tongue

1429
00:48:26,165 --> 00:48:29,705
you had the moderator five seconds later

1430
00:48:29,735 --> 00:48:30,755
okay now you have to route your

1431
00:48:30,785 --> 00:48:31,865
closing arguments please

1432
00:48:33,185 --> 00:48:35,225
ah long story short i feel like

1433
00:48:35,225 --> 00:48:36,515
it's very clear that we don't want

1434
00:48:36,515 --> 00:48:37,925
to koalas in the city center there

1435
00:48:37,925 --> 00:48:40,955
causing much havoc and they're completely unruly

1436
00:48:40,955 --> 00:48:43,505
and they should be in conservatories short

1437
00:48:43,505 --> 00:48:46,085
story long i think koalas are rad

1438
00:48:46,115 --> 00:48:47,105
i think the more that we see

1439
00:48:47,105 --> 00:48:49,625
them there's they're cute i think that

1440
00:48:49,625 --> 00:48:51,125
we can eat them if there ever

1441
00:48:51,125 --> 00:48:52,895
becomes too many

1442
00:48:53,045 --> 00:48:54,995
the problem refer to things that happen

1443
00:48:56,855 --> 00:48:58,295
i know i didn't think i'd think

1444
00:48:58,295 --> 00:49:00,155

1445
00:49:00,185 --> 00:49:01,655

1446
00:49:01,775 --> 00:49:03,575

1450
00:49:10,325 --> 00:49:11,435
