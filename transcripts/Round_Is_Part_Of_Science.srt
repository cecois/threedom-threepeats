00:13:12,025 --> 00:13:14,095
oh it was like slag tights might

374
00:13:14,095 --> 00:13:15,385
grow from the ceiling but they don't

375
00:13:16,165 --> 00:13:18,055
know that it

376
00:13:19,285 --> 00:13:20,515
i don't know i don't say but

377
00:13:20,515 --> 00:13:21,685
i don't think it's ah i remember

378
00:13:21,685 --> 00:13:25,075
reading the the phrase the pace of

379
00:13:25,105 --> 00:13:26,695
about still lag mites and select tights

380
00:13:26,695 --> 00:13:29,545
when i was seven in a spiderman

381
00:13:29,545 --> 00:13:30,685
comic and i always remembered it but

382
00:13:30,685 --> 00:13:32,455
i've forgotten it this point still like

383
00:13:32,515 --> 00:13:34,075
i'm gonna look it up slags look

384
00:13:34,075 --> 00:13:39,265
it up mites might be the ones

385
00:13:39,445 --> 00:13:41,815
you like just allow me it's all

386
00:13:41,815 --> 00:13:44,605
based on i like yes to lag

387
00:13:44,605 --> 00:13:48,025
tides it's a tight squeeze squeeze as

388
00:13:48,025 --> 00:13:49,375
to when i used to lag or

389
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:52,765
not okay wait this is interesting oh

390
00:13:52,765 --> 00:13:55,375
finally guys stakes have been raised on

391
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:57,787
this about fourteen minutes in we finally

392
00:13:58,135 --> 00:13:59,425
really i think many people

393
00:13:59,425 --> 00:14:01,105
will find this exactly not interesting but

394
00:14:01,105 --> 00:14:02,965
i do think it's interesting the difference

395
00:14:02,965 --> 00:14:04,375
and this isn't really a fun phrase

396
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:06,085
but it's a thing the difference is

397
00:14:06,085 --> 00:14:08,635
that a stalactite hangs from the ceiling

398
00:14:08,635 --> 00:14:11,125
while a stalagmite rises from the floor

399
00:14:11,395 --> 00:14:13,825
a mnemonic device popular among schoolchildren holds

400
00:14:13,825 --> 00:14:16,045
that the sea and stalactite stands for

401
00:14:16,045 --> 00:14:18,295
ceiling while the g and stalagmite stands

402
00:14:18,295 --> 00:14:19,555
for ground another use

403
00:14:19,585 --> 00:14:21,718
vol one is hang tight so still

404
00:14:21,718 --> 00:14:23,155
like tights go from the ceiling it

405
00:14:23,155 --> 00:14:24,565

406
00:14:24,745 --> 00:14:26,305

418
00:14:50,785 --> 00:14:53,605
whoever whoever gets really upset has to

419
00:14:53,605 --> 00:14:54,265
jump pool

420
00:14:55,525 --> 00:14:58,490
ah and swim away if you get

421
00:14:58,492 --> 00:15:00,535
really you have to jump the bullets

422
00:15:00,685 --> 00:15:02,935
that's the role you got really upset

423
00:15:02,935 --> 00:15:04,825

427
00:15:12,445 --> 00:15:13,705

434
00:15:27,535 --> 00:15:31,165
delicious it tasted like marshmallow crock so

435
00:15:31,165 --> 00:15:33,385
you still lacked the pudding i thought

436
00:15:33,385 --> 00:15:36,037
you said still lag marshmallow there's still

437
00:15:36,055 --> 00:15:37,675
eg types like my still like marshmallow

438
00:15:37,975 --> 00:15:41,185
stalag mites might grow from

439
00:15:41,215 --> 00:15:42,235
the ceiling but they don't that's what

440
00:15:42,235 --> 00:15:43,765
it is i guess my point was

441
00:15:43,765 --> 00:15:46,615
that my grandfather got so tired oh

442
00:15:46,615 --> 00:15:47,905
yeah and didn't want to deal with

443
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:50,455
us that while we convinced him that

444
00:15:50,455 --> 00:15:51,625
we could go see an r rated

445
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:52,765
movie and he just gave up and

446
00:15:52,765 --> 00:15:54,355
was like yeah we'll drop you off

447
00:15:55,106 --> 00:15:56,335
when we were not allowed i mean

448
00:15:56,365 --> 00:15:59,005
i was eleven or twelve hours of

449
00:15:59,005 --> 00:16:01,285
war that's the bag o c a

450
00:16:01,345 --> 00:16:02,605
kid i don't give a shit at

451
00:16:02,605 --> 00:16:03,865
the best to go to an already

452
00:16:03,866 --> 00:16:05,305
movie when you're too young oh my

453
00:16:05,305 --> 00:16:07,915
god that's absolutely sneak in my parents

454
00:16:07,915 --> 00:16:10,285
let me see cujo because they they

455
00:16:10,285 --> 00:16:11,965
would go see an r rated movie

456
00:16:11,965 --> 00:16:14,845
occasionally and then deem whether it was

457
00:16:14,935 --> 00:16:15,985
okay for us to see and that

458
00:16:15,985 --> 00:16:18,295
was just based on violence so if

459
00:16:18,295 --> 00:16:19,495
it was that was the only thing

460
00:16:19,525 --> 00:16:20,365
i was the only thing it was

461
00:16:20,365 --> 00:16:21,505
violent it was fine and

462
00:16:21,535 --> 00:16:23,725
the same thing with like fine i

463
00:16:23,725 --> 00:16:25,435
get that's not worth nine you save

464
00:16:25,435 --> 00:16:26,725
it was to find if there was

465
00:16:26,725 --> 00:16:28,315
sex it was bad what about swear

466
00:16:28,315 --> 00:16:30,535
words swear words i think they would

467
00:16:30,535 --> 00:16:32,035
get upset and at an f word

468
00:16:32,035 --> 00:16:33,025
but i also think you were able

469
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:35,545
to say f words in pg movies

470
00:16:35,545 --> 00:16:36,445
at the time when you know you

471
00:16:36,475 --> 00:16:38,275
could say asshole on bravo and i

472
00:16:38,275 --> 00:16:40,705

00:16:51,025 --> 00:16:52,705
was free to say then because you

480
00:16:52,705 --> 00:16:55,045

498
00:17:23,995 --> 00:17:25,195

00:17:27,745 --> 00:17:29,635
myself the time i'm not going to

502
00:17:31,195 --> 00:17:32,155
change the work and i tell you

503
00:17:32,155 --> 00:17:34,525
something that drives me crazy and it

504
00:17:34,615 --> 00:17:36,385
is not from a not from a

505
00:17:36,385 --> 00:17:38,665
level of prudery but

506
00:17:39,775 --> 00:17:42,265
kurt when people curse so much on

507
00:17:42,265 --> 00:17:43,855
like a thing where you're not allowed

508
00:17:43,855 --> 00:17:46,105
to curse so much and there's constant

509
00:17:46,105 --> 00:17:49,765
bleeping yeah it's like no one that's

510
00:17:49,765 --> 00:17:51,415
fine for the studio audience that got

511
00:17:51,415 --> 00:17:53,905
to hear that word but it's irritating

512
00:17:53,905 --> 00:17:55,495
to me as a viewer if it's

513
00:17:55,495 --> 00:17:57,805
just constant yeah leaping it's like a

514
00:17:57,805 --> 00:17:59,905
grade that's like you're writing it

515
00:17:59,905 --> 00:18:01,315
it come up with a better thing

516
00:18:01,315 --> 00:18:02,755
so i don't have to listen to

517
00:18:02,755 --> 00:18:04,165
know every i mean we would do

518
00:18:04,165 --> 00:18:05,545
it on bang but we were allowed

519
00:18:05,905 --> 00:18:08,845
five curse words never never what they

520
00:18:08,845 --> 00:18:10,885
called the fcc which was fuck clinton

521
00:18:10,885 --> 00:18:13,855
cock sucker um but we were allowed

522
00:18:13,855 --> 00:18:16,075
as a little intense it's a little

523
00:18:16,075 --> 00:18:18,775
intensive smoker i feel like condo would

524
00:18:18,805 --> 00:18:20,065
become less intense

525
00:18:20,065 --> 00:18:21,385
it's yeah yeah i think people are

526
00:18:21,385 --> 00:18:23,785
going whatever but we were allowed three

527
00:18:23,785 --> 00:18:25,225
or five as i recalled before we

528
00:18:25,225 --> 00:18:26,665
had to bleep him and so if

529
00:18:26,665 --> 00:18:27,685
we ever and we just wrote it

530
00:18:27,685 --> 00:18:29,695
without thinking about bleeps but if we

531
00:18:29,695 --> 00:18:32,785
ever had more than three then became

532
00:18:32,785 --> 00:18:34,735
the discussion of which of these is

533
00:18:34,735 --> 00:18:37,225
funnier bleeped yeah and which are like

534
00:18:37,225 --> 00:18:39,355
yeah when you can't do believe and

535
00:18:39,355 --> 00:18:40,225
that's very sparing

536
00:18:40,225 --> 00:18:42,115
only which i think is fine everyone's

537
00:18:42,145 --> 00:18:43,465
one other b show where we curse

538
00:18:43,476 --> 00:18:44,995
six times though and it would be

539
00:18:44,995 --> 00:18:46,855
like oh fuck which which of these

540
00:18:46,885 --> 00:18:48,685

1028
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:46,670
of weird things that we do but

1029
00:35:47,030 --> 00:35:48,920

1033
00:35:53,570 --> 00:35:55,610
it's comforting and sweet with the cave

1034
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:57,740
ah coincide with like okay now it's

1035
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:58,970

not not not minister okay because that's

1038
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,620
what that's what i think of when

1039
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:09,440
like around six thirty is when i

1040
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:12,080
finally walk the the dogs and it's

1041
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,460
time to open up a bottle

1042
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:17,330
yeah i did not pull the curtains

1043
00:36:17,870 --> 00:36:19,370
so the sun doesn't come in let's

1044
00:36:19,370 --> 00:36:21,440
open up a bottle doors and loretta

1046
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:25,550
i don't really drink at home which

1047
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:27,650
has been a disappointment during this time

1048
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:29,870
i think i have no choice because

1049
00:36:29,870 --> 00:36:31,250

1127
00:39:04,010 --> 00:39:05,900
is it his work well it's one

1128
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:07,610
of the weirdest characters that started off

1129
00:39:07,610 --> 00:39:10,460
in a car commercial yeah it was

1130
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:12,470
it was local car commercials out here

1131
00:39:12,470 --> 00:39:14,090
in l a he just started doing

1132
00:39:14,090 --> 00:39:16,130
it for these commercials that's astounding right

1133
00:39:16,130 --> 00:39:17,450
he would talk to the camera and

1134
00:39:17,450 --> 00:39:18,860
be like hey you gotta go down

1135
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:20,630
to ford whatever you know what i

1136
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:22,130
mean vern yeah they

1137
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:25,280
have great deals and they springboard that

1138
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,500
into a successful movie french really no

1139
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:29,360
word return really is confusing to me

1140
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:31,520
as there was a national soda campaign

1141
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:35,270
first he did speakers for sprite ah

1142
00:39:35,270 --> 00:39:37,160
and then the movies why i think

1143
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:38,930
he was a groundling that's what i

1144
00:39:38,930 --> 00:39:40,122
would guess he might have been yeah

1145
00:39:40,122 --> 00:39:42,320
yeah wow

1146
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:44,060
isn't it i mean what look there's

1147
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:46,010
so many different ways to get into

1148
00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:48,110
showbiz i love that i love that

1149
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:49,460

and then i didn't do any one

1156
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:05,480

1157
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:07,370

1159
00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:12,650
yeah google how we yeah turn search

1160
00:40:12,650 --> 00:40:14,390
term animal house will find that commercial

1161
00:40:14,390 --> 00:40:14,540
because

1162
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:16,070
that was the that was my line

1163
00:40:16,070 --> 00:40:17,180
in it but it was the theme

1164
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:18,470
of it because it was an animal

1165
00:40:18,470 --> 00:40:19,370
it was a grocery that was the

1166
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:22,670
first iranian movie i ever saw true

1167
00:40:22,730 --> 00:40:23,960
so the bing dot com commercials were

1168
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:26,720
like a um sounds familiar train of

1169
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:28,820
thought like ah one person says one

1170
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:30,080
word that represented says what makes them

1171
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:31,190
think of the deadly that kind of

1172
00:40:31,190 --> 00:40:32,540
thing yeah and so it's all these

1173
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:34,400
people like and isaiah campbell

1174
00:40:35,405 --> 00:40:36,455
oh but that was my word i

1175
00:40:36,455 --> 00:40:37,355
worked at the grocery store and like

1176
00:40:37,445 --> 00:40:39,545

circling each other in a fight i

1482
00:51:12,975 --> 00:51:15,135

00:51:15,135 --> 00:51:17,025
and wear a tank top oh no

1484
00:51:17,025 --> 00:51:19,875

00:51:19,875 --> 00:51:21,915
it down just from that in the

1486
00:51:21,915 --> 00:51:23,745
past i did things like that when

1487
00:51:23,745 --> 00:51:25,305
i was when i was younger in

1488
00:51:25,305 --> 00:51:27,445
fact they wanted to eat everything lately

1489
00:51:27,465 --> 00:51:29,565
got a naked baby from the nirvana

1490
00:51:29,595 --> 00:51:31,695
nevermind skyler and grown-up

1491
00:51:31,905 --> 00:51:33,255
jimmy kimmel once and i was like

1493
00:51:36,165 --> 00:51:38,711
with a little dick out they wanted

1494
00:51:38,715 --> 00:51:39,855
him to show that it's likely the

1495
00:51:39,855 --> 00:51:41,565
same you got a little dick right

1496
00:51:41,565 --> 00:51:43,905
you'd be shocked by how some things

1497
00:51:43,905 --> 00:51:46,095
haven't changed so we had to do

1498
00:51:46,095 --> 00:51:48,495
multiple takes of this thing the kids

1499
00:51:48,525 --> 00:51:51,195
up split going to multiple takes of

1500
00:51:51,195 --> 00:51:53,295
this thing and it was not the

1501
00:51:53,295 --> 00:51:55,725
thing that was so mortifying for me

1502
00:51:55,755 --> 00:51:56,175
and everyone

1503
00:51:56,175 --> 00:51:57,555
one was fine like nobody was i

1504
00:51:57,555 --> 00:51:59,565
wasn't holding things up or anything but

1505
00:51:59,595 --> 00:52:05,505
i it was so non taxing you

1506
00:52:05,505 --> 00:52:06,975
know what i mean i was having

1507
00:52:07,095 --> 00:52:08,234
i was struggling with what did you

1508
00:52:08,295 --> 00:52:10,755
do we circle each other to all

1509
00:52:10,755 --> 00:52:12,765
his dialogue and then i rushed the

1510
00:52:12,765 --> 00:52:14,715
guy and the idea is i'm very

1511
00:52:14,715 --> 00:52:16,335
drunk and so the

1512
00:52:16,335 --> 00:52:19,005
guy just like gently takes my shoulders

1513
00:52:19,005 --> 00:52:20,535
and guides me down to the floor

1514
00:52:20,805 --> 00:52:23,295
it was it's funny really funny and

1515
00:52:23,295 --> 00:52:25,125
i instantly pass out i'm like as

1516
00:52:25,125 --> 00:52:26,385
soon as as soon as he touches

1517
00:52:26,385 --> 00:52:27,735
me i just pass out and i

1518
00:52:27,735 --> 00:52:29,715
just go down i just slowly gently

1519
00:52:29,715 --> 00:52:30,435
go down to the floor

1520
00:52:32,295 --> 00:52:33,825
but i would like when i would

1521
00:52:33,825 --> 00:52:35,835
get depending on how i landed

1522
00:52:37,725 --> 00:52:38,925
it would be like i'd be out

1523
00:52:38,925 --> 00:52:41,115
of breath and it was i was

1524
00:52:41,115 --> 00:52:43,635
so i had to fight so hard

1525
00:52:43,635 --> 00:52:46,275
to not just be full of self-loathing

1526
00:52:46,275 --> 00:52:47,325
it's like no you have to do

1527
00:52:47,325 --> 00:52:48,765
your job and you'll do that you

1528
00:52:48,765 --> 00:52:49,695
have to be good at it and

1529
00:52:49,695 --> 00:52:50,895
you have to be funny and the

1530
00:52:50,895 --> 00:52:53,535
character can't be self-loathing current healthcare can't

1531
00:52:53,535 --> 00:52:55,725

1556
00:53:37,665 --> 00:53:39,825
all the time like where pictures end

1557
00:53:39,825 --> 00:53:41,595

00:53:41,715 --> 00:53:43,695
yeah during turns movie you know there

1559
00:53:43,695 --> 00:53:45,375

1561
00:53:46,605 --> 00:53:48,825

you know before i've killed a few

1564
00:53:52,755 --> 00:53:54,435
but it's like this situation it's like

1565
00:53:54,615 --> 00:53:56,325
these are the only pictures they're taking

1566
00:53:56,325 --> 00:53:58,905
of me yeah so it's fine but

1567
00:53:59,475 --> 00:54:02,775
it was i it was a really

1568
00:54:02,805 --> 00:54:04,485
internal thing because it was making me

1569
00:54:04,515 --> 00:54:06,075
i was like i can't let it

1570
00:54:06,075 --> 00:54:08,685

00:54:13,815 --> 00:54:15,795
go and do it get about it

1576
00:54:15,795 --> 00:54:18,495

1577
00:54:18,495 --> 00:54:19,815

1578
00:54:19,815 --> 00:54:21,015
in a bathing suit it's a year

1579
00:54:21,015 --> 00:54:23,085
thinking about all these things like yeah

1580
00:54:23,175 --> 00:54:24,435
great now i have to walk from

1581
00:54:24,435 --> 00:54:25,665

same mobile but it's like it's too

1583
00:54:27,045 --> 00:54:28,605
much to you how do you just

1584
00:54:28,605 --> 00:54:29,685
have to not think about it but

1585
00:54:29,685 --> 00:54:30,885
then that's that's like a

1586
00:54:31,005 --> 00:54:32,715
strength it is so like it's like

1587
00:54:32,715 --> 00:54:34,635
a muscle you like it's ok i

1588
00:54:34,635 --> 00:54:36,165
don't care what i have to make

1589
00:54:36,165 --> 00:54:37,725

your own shows and star in that

1591
00:54:39,735 --> 00:54:40,875

about that when i watched the wrong

1595
00:54:46,515 --> 00:54:48,555
missy because i i of course instantly

1596
00:54:48,555 --> 00:54:49,695

that yeah what if i had to

1598
00:54:51,045 --> 00:54:51,135

in a bathing suit but i don't

1600
00:54:52,935 --> 00:54:54,825
know it's it's also it's harder for

1601
00:54:54,825 --> 00:55:00,225
me to have sympathy for people yeah

1602
00:55:00,375 --> 00:55:02,265
i haven't been sin and being fat

1603
00:55:02,295 --> 00:55:04,065
it's harder for me totally i get

1604
00:55:04,065 --> 00:55:05,535
it but i'm saying like even then

1605
00:55:05,535 --> 00:55:07,425
like you're still thinking like of quot

1606
00:55:07,425 --> 00:55:09,375

to do like a majorly touching like

1663
00:57:00,165 --> 00:57:01,245
it wasn't in the script oh by

1664
00:57:01,245 --> 00:57:02,895
the way you're gonna go like take

1665
00:57:02,895 --> 00:57:05,085
the bottle away from the main character

1666
00:57:05,115 --> 00:57:07,785
and be really concerned and so every

1667
00:57:07,785 --> 00:57:09,045
other thing i'd shot i'd been doing

1668
00:57:09,045 --> 00:57:11,325
really like sarcastically and like with a

1669
00:57:11,325 --> 00:57:12,855
weird character and then they were like

1670
00:57:12,855 --> 00:57:13,695
oh by the way you have to

1671
00:57:13,695 --> 00:57:15,825
be really this is the emotional core

1672
00:57:15,825 --> 00:57:16,605
of the movie it was like

1673
00:57:17,115 --> 00:57:19,155
it's little schizophrenia performance i'd ever given

1674
00:57:19,155 --> 00:57:20,775
but you also had to drive in

1675
00:57:20,775 --> 00:57:22,155
it and there's a really funny school

1676
00:57:22,845 --> 00:57:25,215
where a car pulls up and paul

1677
00:57:25,215 --> 00:57:26,955

1678
00:57:26,955 --> 00:57:30,885

1700
00:58:17,535 --> 00:58:20,475
i did two commercials one for the

1701
00:58:20,475 --> 00:58:23,145
ford focus where i was the voice

1702
00:58:23,145 --> 00:58:25,755
of an orange puppet that the commercials

learned why like puppets don't have suits

1715
00:58:51,825 --> 00:58:54,495

language

1839
01:03:25,885 --> 01:03:27,415

words like big bird or it has

1841
01:03:29,815 --> 01:03:31,225

is it can be a sentence one

1845
01:03:36,355 --> 01:03:37,495
of us thinks of that word then

1846
01:03:37,495 --> 01:03:40,465
another one of us says any word

1847
01:03:40,915 --> 01:03:42,115
okay the person who thinks of the

1848
01:03:42,115 --> 01:03:44,305
secret word keeps it to themselves the

1849
01:03:44,365 --> 01:03:45,775
one of us says n

1850
01:03:45,775 --> 01:03:47,275
any word and then we go around

1851
01:03:47,275 --> 01:03:51,235
clockwise saying whatever word that makes us

1852
01:03:51,235 --> 01:03:51,985
think of

1853
01:03:53,245 --> 01:03:55,945
and the person with the secret word

1854
01:03:55,945 --> 01:03:57,745
is trying to steer it so one

1855
01:03:57,745 --> 01:04:00,025
of us says word okay and and

1856
01:04:00,025 --> 01:04:02,965
if that happens they win otherwise if

1857
01:04:02,965 --> 01:04:04,345
we take too long or if we

1858
01:04:04,345 --> 01:04:06,265
repeat a word then we're out and

1859
01:04:06,265 --> 01:04:09,685
give that same one march right down

1860
01:04:09,685 --> 01:04:11,635

1861
01:04:11,905 --> 01:04:13,345
be honest about it unless i think

1862
01:04:13,375 --> 01:04:14,695
you're gonna forget i need to hear

1875
01:04:38,245 --> 01:04:39,625
trying to get anyone to say that

1876
01:04:39,625 --> 01:04:40,915
secret was a person who thinks of

1877
01:04:40,915 --> 01:04:42,355
the secret word is trying to lead

1878
01:04:42,385 --> 01:04:44,725
us into saying like so i would

1879
01:04:44,725 --> 01:04:47,125
eventually like bamboo and then you'd be

1880
01:04:47,125 --> 01:04:49,015
like lee panda and then that you'd

1881
01:04:49,015 --> 01:04:50,425
be like oh eucalyptus and then i'd

1882
01:04:50,425 --> 01:04:50,905

something that someone's already said we're out

1888
01:05:01,675 --> 01:05:03,295
