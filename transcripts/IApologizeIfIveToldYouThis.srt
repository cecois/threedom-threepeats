1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:00,570
three

2
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:12,510
the people beeping

3
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:19,200
um yeah my neighbor dee dabba dabba

4
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,150
you know about boop and beep but

5
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:23,220
what about bip have been saying this

6
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:25,620
for years we are not getting enough

7
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:27,150
bip up in this clip

8
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,936
because bob yes obvious topic bob up

9
00:00:31,936 --> 00:00:33,390
up up up what if we did

10
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:35,310
that as a three year warranty but

11
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:36,870
we just say it out loud how

12
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,370
do you play bobby ahead yeah it

13
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:40,050
was a machine you have to have

14
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:42,780
a machine the machine like a cotton

15
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:45,210
gin those weird yeah lady michelle vacuum

16
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:46,560
cleaner you know when you'd get one

17
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,760
of those and you'd be like i'm

18
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:48,480
now this is my

19
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,010
the thing i remember when baba was

20
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:51,927
known it was a whole personnel was

21
00:00:51,927 --> 00:00:56,550
so mean what constitutes a machine ah

22
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:57,510
you're wanting one

23
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:01,200
your one your one of your part

24
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,520
i think parts yeah i think you

25
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:04,642
nailed it yeah part it turns on

26
00:01:04,653 --> 00:01:05,880
turns off but does it have to

27
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,200
have a use or can it just

28
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,150
be a machine that does nothing well

29
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:11,850
i think like me oh wow also

30
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:13,170
if a machine is broken it is

31
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:15,660
still a machine that's so timing such

32
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:17,250
a philosopher if a heart is broken

33
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:18,480
it's still a heart this is so

34
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:21,630
deep although you're dead yeah is a

35
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:23,010
body which it comes to the brokenhearted

36
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,840
they die is the body machine because

37
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,520
it's a lot of muscle machines it's

38
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,590
a beautiful machine extraordinary machine but once

39
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:30,270
it dies and decomposes is it still

40
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:31,560
a machine no

41
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:34,110
thank you for answering all my questions

42
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:35,550
here's why a lot of the parts

43
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:37,920
went away oh so if you have

44
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,690
a tire that's part of a machine

45
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:42,900
but it's not a car okay so

46
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:45,420
wait if you have a tire but

47
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:47,460
hook it up to any like flat

48
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:49,530
surface it's suddenly a machine any flat

49
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:52,530
surface yes exactly a board that's like

50
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:52,770
so

51
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,670
that's right yeah yeah a lot of

52
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:55,680
science project i did where i would

53
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,330
just kinda like start gluing stuff together

54
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,560
i'm just like it's something

55
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:03,030
what were the ah and we've talked

56
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:04,098
i don't know i didn't want no

57
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,150
science projects now don't think so i

58
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:07,710
didn't glue a tire to a board

59
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,420
but i did do i did one

60
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:10,950
that was actually very involved i didn't

61
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:12,270
think you actually glue but my dad

62
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:14,640
was heavily also involved in making it

63
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,940
um but it was probably middle school

64
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:19,920
and this was like maybe it was

65
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,620
elementary school it's to admit it would

66
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:23,730
be clear that i had helped in

67
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:25,740
elementary school but anyways the idea was

68
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:28,890
it was a self-watering plant so you

69
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,846
have water or even a watering can

70
00:02:30,846 --> 00:02:32,100
that's on a timer so oh okay

71
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:34,260
i had a watering can on a

72
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:36,690
sort of ah which we call it

73
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:39,570
how often we also know water plants

74
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:40,080
you know

75
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:40,380
no

76
00:02:41,708 --> 00:02:43,170
give me a flat like it was

77
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:44,988
you or you're doing miami so little

78
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:46,800
air actually okay there was a wheel

79
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,080
wholly but i meant the things i

80
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,599
meant the rubber like i'm sort of

81
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:52,410
like excusing when it goes around what

82
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:54,000
she's doing i didn't she's trying to

83
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:56,670
make this look like gaslighting yes okay

84
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:57,750
are you done ladies

85
00:03:01,574 --> 00:03:04,560
um yeah anger i mean you know

86
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,110
like you know like put your finger

87
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:08,912
in that hole but your finger in

88
00:03:08,912 --> 00:03:10,680
that hole but putting them here i'm

89
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:14,040
gonna conveyor belt conveyor belts around it

90
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,330
and then it had a ton so

91
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:16,650
it was attached to a timer and

92
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:18,879
the timer was made the

93
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,850
the wheel move which i often was

94
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:23,790
time to go backwards go it i'm

95
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:25,410
sure it was sixty seconds i mean

96
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:27,990
you're watering your plant every six cycles

97
00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:31,320
every midst it's a concept piece i

98
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,300
didn't have the tools this was what

99
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,530
it could be let's say if you

100
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:36,420
had a kitchen timer that went for

101
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:38,220
an owl why aren't there timers that

102
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:38,910
go for like

103
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:41,700
water play twenty four hours yeah why

104
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,080
aren't there times they do everything for

105
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,820
kitchen timers to do twenty four hours

106
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:47,040
their job you need two hands to

107
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:47,310
drink

108
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:51,029
yeah i want to invent one oh

109
00:03:51,029 --> 00:03:52,200
love that put an egg in a

110
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,514
pot i guess it's not inventing it's

111
00:03:53,514 --> 00:03:55,140
just making i'm making my famous twenty

112
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:55,890
four hour eggs

113
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:59,340
oh yummy there they're only twenty four

114
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:01,950
hour ray they're completely grey they're absolute

115
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:05,400
shock enjoy so for my science projects

116
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,020
when i was i think an eighth

117
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:09,630
grade um our teacher at the beginning

118
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:10,740
of the year was like ok you're

119
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:11,880
going to have to do a science

120
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,110
project this year and you're gonna have

121
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:14,310
to clear it through me and it's

122
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:15,840
going to be like half of your

123
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,010
grain it's going to be a big

124
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:17,250
thing

125
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,990
you have to make a huge presentation

126
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:22,020
and i get the patent yes but

127
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:23,880
so i was so lazy i wish

128
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,370
to shark tank with things that students

129
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:27,450
didn't they just act like it was

130
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:30,030
there they have a pull out three-sided

131
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:33,300
board and it has three sided born

132
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:35,070
in this phone boards that have three

133
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:36,718
sides that stand out but they say

134
00:04:36,718 --> 00:04:37,440
like science proj

135
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,420
fact yeah it's like it's it's like

136
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:40,890
carbone but you just fold it like

137
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:43,260
a gatefold yeah whatever you needed to

138
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:44,970
be called okay honey you don't know

139
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:45,840
what a something has

140
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,170
when you say something has three sides

141
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:51,420
that's hard to picture while a triangle

142
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:55,140
isn't hard to picture something huh three

143
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:57,930
sides yeah about a person top bottom

144
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:58,290
middle

145
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,860
i stood corrected both sides asking

146
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:04,620
um so i never said that i

147
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:05,970
was so lazy that i just said

148
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:08,220
like my my idea for a project

149
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:09,420
was we had a poodle at the

150
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:11,430
time and it was something to the

151
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:15,000
effect of like how how long does

152
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,980
a poodle survive underwater

153
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:19,237
and then we didn't have a poodle

154
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:20,010
and i had to go to a

155
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:22,470
counselor it was like how long does

156
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:25,625
a poodle be outside versilia

157
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,110
suitable pianos

158
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:31,020
how long is it considered abuse if

159
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:33,240
it's outside hello does a poodle build

160
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:37,440
your name pepsi me

161
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,990
wow

162
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:45,540
i forgot about that mc the poodle

163
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:48,780
but basically just entailed me like staring

164
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:50,550
at my poodle all day for a

165
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:52,740
few days and writing down my findings

166
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,240
oh i love when kids do survive

167
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,406
that and they think that's like a

168
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,500
project and it got cleared and then

169
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:00,240
i'm sorry what was experiment again how

170
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,920
long how awesome hobbies

171
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:04,890
a poodle of psi of poodle outside

172
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:07,770
long ago i'm not what people do

00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:10,410
what dat poodle do doe or maybe

174
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:12,060
it was like how often how often

175
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,500
does a poodle sleep i don't i

176
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,519
don't remember what it was but it

177
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:18,090
just i just remember sleep you gotta

178
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:19,290
figure stuff like that now you can

179
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:20,490
just look it up here i'm gonna

180
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:21,870
look at it yeah please no way

181
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,720
i've known that or does a poodle

182
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:31,050
sleep sleep approximately thirteen hours and only

183
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:35,760
at night ah um total thirteen in

184
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,840
their life sleep during

185
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:40,650
they're so tight their lives and over

186
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,660
a year they're running on fumes okay

187
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:44,670
it can be normal versatile use these

188
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:46,590
running a few some dogs can sleep

189
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:49,020
as much as twenty hours a day

00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:51,240
well that's early hours a day duck

nber barely doing the gatefold fold out

195
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:01,859
and just kind of like doing it

196
00:07:01,859 --> 00:07:04,800
with a marker and no pictures or

197
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,420
anything i think i just like stapled

198
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:08,790
my the the lines paper where i

199
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:10,440
wrote down what it'll take to it

200
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,240
or something i got a terrible grade

201
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,520
in high school my first year of

202
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,590
high school i had this class called

203
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:18,240
ah i p s intraday

204
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,910
victory physical sign your swing penis irritable

205
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:22,676
penis syndrome you just poop out of

206
00:07:22,676 --> 00:07:24,120
your dick all day yeah and it

207
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:24,780
makes you irritable

208
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,170
i used to do this we had

209
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:30,295
to do this experiment we are not

210
00:07:30,295 --> 00:07:31,320
experiment we had to do it we

211
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,790
had to redo a report and i

212
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:35,580
can't remember what the broad assignment was

213
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:39,270
but i did a report on computer

214
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:41,700
languages which really i'm wearing which by

215
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:43,770
the way who bip bip probably came

216
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:45,990
into play bip absolutely gaming

217
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,880
this ties into our connections the other

218
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:50,220
day computer links right that one i

219
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:53,400
did not understand not complete you finally

220
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,870
did get the computer languages i was

221
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:55,920
but that was the first one i

222
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:57,300
don't know i didn't get it i

223
00:07:57,330 --> 00:07:59,340
that was a line i didn't understand

224
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:01,080
or it was just ah i left

225
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,550
to i don't know what happened it

226
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:04,020
was bad you gave it to god

227
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:05,880
i gave that one to god through

228
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:06,210
god

229
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,710
never gives you a connections that you

230
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:09,240
can't solve that's not true

231
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:12,180
you're just not trying hard enough oh

232
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:14,370
and so it was like i didn't

233
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:16,440
know what i was doing it was

234
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,480
my idea do you know anything about

235
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:21,660
computers no ah that go beep boop

236
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:23,100
yeah that's right that's all i put

237
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:25,380
up ip i think where i failed

238
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:26,910
but i got a failing grade on

239
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:29,760
that paper no baldacci was like

240
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:31,650
this is one of this was the

241
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:34,380
beginning of my problems with science at

242
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:37,890
school where everyone assumed that i should

243
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:40,170
be good at it why because he

244
00:08:40,170 --> 00:08:41,520
had good because i had good grades

245
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:44,580
otherwise be right guys shy war go

246
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:44,940
to school

247
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:50,550
yeah your name was nikola tesla and

248
00:08:50,869 --> 00:08:52,920
i was just like i didn't know

249
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,990
what i couldn't i couldn't do any

250
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:57,630
science that had math attached to it

251
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:00,090
i also just a lot really didn't

252
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:02,580
know yeah except biology great yeah they

253
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:03,840
moved me and they moved me into

254
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:06,240
the slightly dumber track o in biology

255
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:08,940
ology yes really yes and then i

256
00:09:08,942 --> 00:09:10,321
was like this is where i belong

257
00:09:10,327 --> 00:09:12,030
baby i was talking on the sun

258
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:14,340
mike's pod tracker but i was talking

259
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:17,654
about um that in my so i

260
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:20,220
skipped it into biology freshman year of

261
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:21,810
high school because you were allowed to

262
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:23,070
save it to sophomore year if you

263
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:24,390
want to but no one did that

264
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:25,530
i just didn't want to do it

265
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:26,400
yeah and so i

266
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:27,118
did it in the next year but

267
00:09:27,118 --> 00:09:28,200
that i was in class with all

268
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:31,710
freshmen hot and two other sophomores because

269
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:33,000
it was like mostly freshmen

270
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:37,320
modes and i had to do a

271
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,840
project where we had me we had

272
00:09:39,843 --> 00:09:42,270
a whole semester long project where we

273
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:44,190
had to like a season long arc

274
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:46,050
you had to be doing this the

275
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:49,230
whole time doing what whatever your project

276
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:50,610
directing a baby pig

277
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,640
god one year they tear it apart

278
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,680
the next year the next together they

279
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:56,790
put it back together we've talked about

280
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:59,760
that oh yeah disgusting um what was

281
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,260
your project so i didn't have anything

282
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:02,490
i didn't think about it for months

283
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:04,170
i just was like i don't care

284
00:10:05,905 --> 00:10:07,195
but this is and it is weird

285
00:10:07,195 --> 00:10:08,605
that they make you take sides like

286
00:10:08,605 --> 00:10:10,675
what bearing does it have on your

287
00:10:10,675 --> 00:10:12,295
life at all i mean i remember

288
00:10:12,295 --> 00:10:13,525
a couple things from it but anyways

289
00:10:13,525 --> 00:10:16,343
so like what the one we loved

290
00:10:16,343 --> 00:10:18,415
about deet so i remember but what

291
00:10:18,415 --> 00:10:20,605
deet is from silent spring that's where

292
00:10:20,605 --> 00:10:21,895
the kids grind at each other

293
00:10:23,515 --> 00:10:26,215
ah

294
00:10:27,295 --> 00:10:30,355
say i the last second it was

295
00:10:30,355 --> 00:10:31,285
due and i was like i gotta

296
00:10:31,285 --> 00:10:32,875
figure this out so like the weekend

297
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:34,165
before it was due i i don't

298
00:10:34,165 --> 00:10:36,865
know somebody's friends mom my friends mom

299
00:10:36,895 --> 00:10:39,415
helped me they knew a biologist who

300
00:10:39,415 --> 00:10:41,095
is going to like the creek to

301
00:10:41,095 --> 00:10:42,865
like do a study on how do

302
00:10:42,865 --> 00:10:44,425
they know this person it was so

303
00:10:44,425 --> 00:10:46,255
lucky wait this sounds familiar to me

304
00:10:46,495 --> 00:10:47,395
i probably told it well

305
00:10:47,395 --> 00:10:48,505
well on this i've talked about the

306
00:10:48,505 --> 00:10:49,975
bug man of the bug man of

307
00:10:49,975 --> 00:10:53,965
alcatraz previously i made talked about this

308
00:10:53,965 --> 00:10:57,115
then but this person took me to

309
00:10:57,115 --> 00:10:59,485
like the creek or the river whatever

310
00:10:59,485 --> 00:11:00,265
the fuck it was and you were

311
00:11:00,265 --> 00:11:01,525
never seen again and i want to

312
00:11:01,525 --> 00:11:01,975
hear emma

313
00:11:03,445 --> 00:11:05,695
and we got a big waiters on

314
00:11:05,695 --> 00:11:06,535
and that was like in the water

315
00:11:06,535 --> 00:11:09,415
like getting getting samples and like looking

316
00:11:09,415 --> 00:11:10,986
at the samples of what the semitones

317
00:11:10,986 --> 00:11:12,925
on the spores and like in a

318
00:11:12,925 --> 00:11:15,360
microscope water right just like yeah okay

319
00:11:15,415 --> 00:11:17,545
it's like justin this shit and yeah

320
00:11:17,545 --> 00:11:18,325
and then i had to write a

321
00:11:18,325 --> 00:11:19,645
paper about it and they did nothing

322
00:11:19,645 --> 00:11:20,995
worse than a creek they took pictures

323
00:11:20,995 --> 00:11:23,155
of me on yeah disposable

324
00:11:23,215 --> 00:11:25,075
camera yeah yeah it does in my

325
00:11:25,135 --> 00:11:28,315
book right yeah see my decor yeah

326
00:11:28,345 --> 00:11:29,905
honestly i'm like i didn't know i

327
00:11:29,935 --> 00:11:31,945
did great wow yeah congrats because i

328
00:11:31,945 --> 00:11:33,115
just dated everything like it was all

329
00:11:33,115 --> 00:11:34,375
different times and stuff

330
00:11:35,635 --> 00:11:37,315
that was the only science

331
00:11:38,575 --> 00:11:40,735
report that i can remember that i

332
00:11:40,735 --> 00:11:43,435
ever did well i i did biology

333
00:11:43,735 --> 00:11:45,445
twice because we did it in junior

334
00:11:45,445 --> 00:11:47,485
high and then also in ninth grade

335
00:11:48,055 --> 00:11:50,365
and we've discussed before i dissected both

336
00:11:50,365 --> 00:11:52,405
a frog and a worm i did

337
00:11:52,405 --> 00:11:55,825
worm frog pig i did pig frog

338
00:11:56,035 --> 00:11:58,195
i think the end pig frog the

339
00:11:58,195 --> 00:11:58,525
end

340
00:11:58,825 --> 00:12:01,165
pigs that's the worst that's the worst

341
00:12:01,225 --> 00:12:02,545
it's horrible that it's the most like

342
00:12:02,545 --> 00:12:05,275
a human that's really well you look

343
00:12:05,275 --> 00:12:05,695
like one

344
00:12:06,835 --> 00:12:11,755
just cheese weight and looks wise yeah

345
00:12:11,755 --> 00:12:14,335
you're like two pounds and you're covered

346
00:12:14,335 --> 00:12:14,755
in mud

347
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:18,745
so your best business partner would discussing

348
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:21,175
and i was able to skip chemistry

349
00:12:21,295 --> 00:12:21,925
investments just

350
00:12:23,275 --> 00:12:25,795
ah but then i had to take

351
00:12:25,795 --> 00:12:27,745
physics which i don't remember anything oh

352
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:30,565
that seems than irresistible force and shit

353
00:12:30,595 --> 00:12:33,565
you resistible force in my high school

354
00:12:33,655 --> 00:12:34,885
you only have to take three years

355
00:12:34,885 --> 00:12:36,895
of science senior year i did not

356
00:12:36,895 --> 00:12:39,205
take one i was thrilled huh yeah

357
00:12:39,205 --> 00:12:40,885
that's why schematic in here but that

358
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:42,325
was my mistake yeah i didn't have

359
00:12:42,325 --> 00:12:43,315
to do math and science my

360
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:45,325
senior year yeah and we also did

361
00:12:45,325 --> 00:12:46,765
not have a p program at my

362
00:12:46,765 --> 00:12:49,525
school wow guys you never got to

363
00:12:49,525 --> 00:12:51,415
see other dudes naked know you want

364
00:12:51,415 --> 00:12:53,995
to know yeah i've never seen a

365
00:12:53,995 --> 00:12:57,055
penis isn't that crazy it was crazy

366
00:12:57,055 --> 00:12:58,615
i don't i don't not even running

367
00:12:58,615 --> 00:13:00,655
around the school or know nothing i

368
00:13:00,655 --> 00:13:02,125
mean there was a sports program but

369
00:13:02,125 --> 00:13:03,145
we did not have to do p

370
00:13:03,175 --> 00:13:03,445
that's

371
00:13:03,475 --> 00:13:06,775
nice right right hated it every day

372
00:13:06,925 --> 00:13:09,805

i hope so i think i think

405
00:14:10,825 --> 00:14:12,403
it's a cursory cleaning at best because

406
00:14:12,403 --> 00:14:14,155
they're wiping with paper towels you guys

was in fourth grade i couldn't switch

445
00:15:21,925 --> 00:15:23,875
i can swim forever obviously and when

446
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:24,535
i was in fourth grade

447
00:15:24,634 --> 00:15:25,975
a book about a girl couldn't swim

448
00:15:25,975 --> 00:15:27,537
and it was called wrote a book

449
00:15:27,565 --> 00:15:30,085
by rata but read a chapter book

450
00:15:30,475 --> 00:15:32,665
the alice books not go ask alice

451
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:34,194
but it was a separate thing it

452
00:15:34,194 --> 00:15:35,785
was real alice always had trials and

453
00:15:35,785 --> 00:15:39,295
tribulations and she couldn't swim and she

454
00:15:39,685 --> 00:15:42,175
learned by and someone told her like

455
00:15:42,235 --> 00:15:44,575
pop up like a champagne cork

456
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:48,355
i love shrooms go yeah corkscrew yeah

457
00:15:49,105 --> 00:15:50,485
and i just remember that and then

458
00:15:50,485 --> 00:15:51,535
i just did that you just sit

459
00:15:51,565 --> 00:15:53,755
back great and i passed and then

460
00:15:53,755 --> 00:15:55,105
i that i was able to do

461
00:15:55,105 --> 00:15:57,145
all the activities and like i did

462
00:15:57,355 --> 00:15:59,335
probably got better at swimming because of

463
00:15:59,335 --> 00:16:02,095
it but it was always it's also

464
00:16:02,095 --> 00:16:03,322
horrible cause you're gonna bathing suit in

465
00:16:03,325 --> 00:16:04,846
your with poison it's

466
00:16:04,915 --> 00:16:06,835
so gross it's bad and you don't

467
00:16:06,835 --> 00:16:08,845
know your body that's yeah it just

468
00:16:08,845 --> 00:16:10,645
seemed insane that it used to be

469
00:16:10,675 --> 00:16:11,965
to teach someone to swim you just

470
00:16:11,965 --> 00:16:13,285
take them down to the watering hole

471
00:16:13,285 --> 00:16:15,115
and throw him in yeah and that

472
00:16:15,115 --> 00:16:16,555
was it yeah because i lived in

473
00:16:16,555 --> 00:16:17,275
our town as well

474
00:16:19,735 --> 00:16:20,995
no but just you know a hundred

475
00:16:20,995 --> 00:16:23,005
hours ago i mean my parents would

476
00:16:23,005 --> 00:16:24,685
write i was the that was the

477
00:16:24,685 --> 00:16:26,785
theory they tried many times for me

478
00:16:26,785 --> 00:16:28,315
to swim i just always quit because

479
00:16:28,315 --> 00:16:29,605
i would just start panicking i'll get

480
00:16:29,635 --> 00:16:31,555
a little bit better every time i

481
00:16:31,555 --> 00:16:32,605
kind of start from scratch over and

482
00:16:32,605 --> 00:16:33,505
over and i'm not a great swimmer

483
00:16:33,505 --> 00:16:34,525
i had tried i remember going to

484
00:16:34,525 --> 00:16:37,165
camp when we had swimming that was

485
00:16:37,165 --> 00:16:38,515
the worst that can it was

486
00:16:38,515 --> 00:16:41,275
cause i remember being like i could

487
00:16:41,395 --> 00:16:43,585
i could survive said yeah you know

488
00:16:43,675 --> 00:16:46,525
thank god yeah yeah yeah yeah otherwise

489
00:16:46,525 --> 00:16:47,245
it would be to them

490
00:16:48,385 --> 00:16:49,885
oh we never would have had this

491
00:16:49,885 --> 00:16:51,625
show if you died would have been

492
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:53,695
to them oh no you definitely would

493
00:16:53,695 --> 00:16:54,595
have done a podcast together

494
00:16:56,035 --> 00:16:57,865

502
00:17:10,675 --> 00:17:12,445

plus five and then people yes but

508
00:17:22,345 --> 00:17:23,605
i was so scared of the swimming

509
00:17:23,605 --> 00:17:25,225
lessons and so scared of drowning that

510
00:17:25,225 --> 00:17:27,775
i ran away out of the pool

511
00:17:27,805 --> 00:17:29,635
and the pool it was a community

512
00:17:29,635 --> 00:17:30,595
pool and it was next to a

513
00:17:30,595 --> 00:17:32,815
graveyard and i ran into the gravy

514
00:17:32,845 --> 00:17:34,315
i ran into the graveyard and hid

515
00:17:34,315 --> 00:17:36,430
behind the gravestones i this is less

516
00:17:36,445 --> 00:17:36,757
narrative

517
00:17:38,065 --> 00:17:38,815
what a creep

518
00:17:41,291 --> 00:17:44,455
cool next to the graveyard so scary

519
00:17:44,485 --> 00:17:47,335
this cemented too many scary things happening

520
00:17:47,425 --> 00:17:49,105
there's just not enough room we've got

521
00:17:49,105 --> 00:17:50,485
to put it right here my eight

522
00:17:50,485 --> 00:17:52,825
is quite well first of all why

523
00:17:52,825 --> 00:17:57,205
have graveyards well you know that is

524
00:17:57,415 --> 00:17:59,035
good that is a question we need

525
00:17:59,035 --> 00:18:00,115
to consider because they feel

526
00:18:00,115 --> 00:18:02,005
over time there's there's not going to

527
00:18:02,005 --> 00:18:04,705
be space why didn't we bury people

528
00:18:04,735 --> 00:18:07,705
standing when you drive into new york

529
00:18:07,945 --> 00:18:09,745
from the airport yeah and you'd go

530
00:18:09,745 --> 00:18:13,285
pass those very long amounts of graves

531
00:18:13,525 --> 00:18:16,285
yeah then they the skyscrapers just hanging

532
00:18:16,285 --> 00:18:17,215
out right behind them just go like

533
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:19,975
this is just one step to the

534
00:18:19,975 --> 00:18:20,275
next

535
00:18:20,275 --> 00:18:22,555
ks we live we die it's just

536
00:18:22,555 --> 00:18:24,895
very very depressing to preview of the

537
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,245
future when you go into the big

538
00:18:26,245 --> 00:18:28,465

00:25:43,690 --> 00:25:45,460
to us they amped it up

742
00:25:45,490 --> 00:25:47,080
to where it feels like there's five

743
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,812
or six more than the first sees

744
00:25:48,812 --> 00:25:50,620
there were so many and and you're

745
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:51,700
it does feel like you want to

746
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:52,930
go like let's just get to yeah

747
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,760
but you also need to see of

748
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:57,370
course ah yeah because you don't know

749
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:58,930

755
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:07,300

805
00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:47,740
the next one i got mafia and

806
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:48,070
i said

807
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:49,120
everyone i am mafia

808
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:52,178
wow and they voted me out and

809
00:27:52,178 --> 00:27:54,340
i was like that proves oh but

810
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:57,034
but then but then it's dropped into

811
00:27:57,034 --> 00:27:58,690
the next round you don't tell right

812
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:02,050
i will we were playing that game

813
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:04,390
secret hitler or the board game which

814
00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:05,800
i'm now certain i mean the real

815
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:06,820
one was bad enough

816
00:28:08,034 --> 00:28:09,190
you know what i mean the the

817
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:11,841
public one anyways yeah we went to

818
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:13,600
watch a game night and we were

819
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:16,600
thinking about private hitler yeah i think

820
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:17,320
he's in the army

821
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:23,590
private hitler reporting for duty nine anyways

822
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:25,930
the same game essentially right yeah um

823
00:28:25,930 --> 00:28:27,040
but it's a board game version of

824
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,120
that but this way you get to

825
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:30,550
think about it i know it's not

826
00:28:30,550 --> 00:28:32,740
good but anyways what's worse mafia or

827
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:34,660
hitler make anyone think of a werewolf

828
00:28:34,690 --> 00:28:36,250
but hitler if he went to a

829
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:38,380
board game or game nightmare like this

830
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:38,500
was

831
00:28:38,530 --> 00:28:41,740
years ago and we we all smoked

832
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:44,800
weed this was years ago yeah okay

833
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:46,600
okay so three years ago

834
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:49,870
but i think i was definitely way

835
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,610
more high than anybody else and i

836
00:28:51,610 --> 00:28:53,200
didn't really know the other i can

837
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,430
see that very little

838
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:58,990
and so it was like my close

839
00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:00,700
friends who were hosting them to other

840
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:01,900
couples and eyes and like i didn't

841
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:03,490
really know the other couples like maybe

842
00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:04,840
my first time hanging out with them

843
00:29:05,350 --> 00:29:06,910
and were playing this game and i

844
00:29:06,910 --> 00:29:08,020
like to get very into games like

845
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:10,630
this like i i want to win

846
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:11,860
it's fun and but i was also

847
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:13,600
really high so in the game like

848
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,700
your great grandma oh yeah

849
00:29:16,090 --> 00:29:17,350
i'm very competitive and also out of

850
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:19,570
my mind you're like you pull cards

851
00:29:19,570 --> 00:29:21,220
and you're determined whether you're a fascist

852
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:22,840
or liberal which is the famous traitor

853
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:26,980
faithful and then i like the the

854
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:28,750
way the cards work like the other

855
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:31,090
person like will like you basically you

856
00:29:31,090 --> 00:29:32,680
pull cards and you can go like

857
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,210
ok since i am a fascist my

858
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:35,860
goal is to push the fan

859
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:37,990
fascist agenda so i'm going to try

860
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:39,400
to give this other person who gets

861
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,620
to choose for my cards only fat

862
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:42,790
you know they kind of have to

863
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:44,020
go with what i'm trying to push

864
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:47,860
anyway it involves lying involves being like

865
00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:50,500
a little thoughtful i'm right meanwhile you're

866
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:52,300
high yeah and then i gave the

867
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:54,040
cards and then they were like i

868
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,270
had to put a fascist site

869
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:57,460
damn it i want to tell you

870
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:58,660
you're wrong by the way you're hiring

871
00:29:58,810 --> 00:30:00,880
nicely tell everyone this is too confusing

872
00:30:00,910 --> 00:30:02,830
anyway i literally just go like i

873
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:04,330
said exactly the wrong thing but i

874
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:05,620
was so adamant about it and i

875
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:07,480
was like i had to put ahead

876
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,980
a profession to give me all liberals

877
00:30:09,010 --> 00:30:09,970
or whatever like it was like it

878
00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:11,560
didn't make sense and i was like

879
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,480
why and i was like so strong

880
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,440
and then i was like he's hitler

881
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,207
he told me like

882
00:30:16,905 --> 00:30:18,615
maybe because i'm pointing through the bathroom

883
00:30:18,675 --> 00:30:19,545
i was like when everyone had their

884
00:30:19,545 --> 00:30:21,345
eyes closed he said he was like

885
00:30:21,345 --> 00:30:21,705
i was like

886
00:30:23,355 --> 00:30:24,675
and everyone was like hating it and

887
00:30:24,675 --> 00:30:26,745
it was not cool i can feel

888
00:30:26,745 --> 00:30:28,125
the room turn against me and the

889
00:30:28,125 --> 00:30:29,715
game was bad if you ever seen

890
00:30:29,745 --> 00:30:31,995
any of those people ever again um

891
00:30:32,025 --> 00:30:33,225
i don't remember who one of the

892
00:30:33,225 --> 00:30:35,145
couples was and then the other one

893
00:30:35,145 --> 00:30:36,225
yes but i always feel like the

894
00:30:36,225 --> 00:30:37,965
guys kind of like hey here there's

895
00:30:38,865 --> 00:30:42,285

thing we got we got cushy loves

945
00:32:30,495 --> 00:32:32,325

950
00:32:44,595 --> 00:32:46,095
and like the towns in that time

951
00:32:47,475 --> 00:32:49,515
i don't know that joke please don't

952
00:32:49,515 --> 00:32:50,535
explain it yeah well

953
00:32:51,855 --> 00:32:55,995
ah um but a very very strange

954
00:32:55,995 --> 00:33:00,195
musical about racist maybe his whole life

955
00:33:00,195 --> 00:33:02,445
has their multiple actors playing him no

956
00:33:02,445 --> 00:33:05,085
known well know there are there are

957
00:33:05,325 --> 00:33:07,365
child actors it but but the the

958
00:33:07,365 --> 00:33:10,155
conceit of it is is mtv in

959
00:33:10,155 --> 00:33:11,805
nineteen ninety three

960
00:33:11,865 --> 00:33:14,565
comes to a rehearsal for his concert

961
00:33:14,565 --> 00:33:16,245
in order to interview him in the

962
00:33:16,785 --> 00:33:19,245
the tough but fair interviewer wants to

963
00:33:19,275 --> 00:33:21,615
she wants to make a real documentary

964
00:33:21,615 --> 00:33:23,445
about it and ask him real questions

965
00:33:23,955 --> 00:33:26,985
and they're all it'll be amusing that

966
00:33:26,985 --> 00:33:28,635
is needed to have this sort of

967
00:33:28,635 --> 00:33:30,015
kunci i think he'd just go like

968
00:33:30,015 --> 00:33:31,995
it's his life story what a wish

969
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:35,205
yeah so so they isn't there just

970
00:33:35,205 --> 00:33:37,455
enough there like to go like child

971
00:33:37,455 --> 00:33:39,105
star we all know the story yeah

972
00:33:39,165 --> 00:33:40,185
yeah i guess i assumed it was

973
00:33:40,185 --> 00:33:41,895
more of a jukebox kind of thing

974
00:33:41,895 --> 00:33:43,635
that was not necessarily was it was

975
00:33:43,635 --> 00:33:45,705
a strange combination of like him talking

976
00:33:45,705 --> 00:33:47,325
about his life and you flashing back

977
00:33:47,325 --> 00:33:49,275
to the sixties when he's in the

978
00:33:49,275 --> 00:33:50,835
jackson five as a kid and

979
00:33:51,975 --> 00:33:54,165
yeah exactly all these and they're singing

980
00:33:54,165 --> 00:33:55,935
the actual songs as these are songs

981
00:33:55,935 --> 00:33:57,375
and we are the people singing them

982
00:33:57,405 --> 00:34:00,525
right and then suddenly hill like starts

983
00:34:00,765 --> 00:34:02,955
in the present day feeling really bad

984
00:34:02,955 --> 00:34:04,995
about something and then start singing it's

985
00:34:04,995 --> 00:34:08,115
like i'm a stranger in moscow and

986
00:34:08,475 --> 00:34:10,128
like it's not a song they'd ranger

987
00:34:10,128 --> 00:34:10,935
in my scalp

988
00:34:12,255 --> 00:34:13,365
happy that it's scary

989
00:34:15,135 --> 00:34:16,240
i'm afraid it was that after he

990
00:34:16,275 --> 00:34:16,995
his haircut burnt

991
00:34:20,356 --> 00:34:22,485

992
00:34:25,485 --> 00:34:26,535

and he sings it to her the

996
00:34:31,335 --> 00:34:34,785
interviewer and they dance around and then

997
00:34:34,785 --> 00:34:36,525
she's like i love i love the

998
00:34:36,525 --> 00:34:38,205

to make another movie that's like it's

1040
00:36:02,205 --> 00:36:04,005
perfect capstone of the end of his

1041
00:36:04,185 --> 00:36:05,715

1042
00:36:05,715 --> 00:36:07,665
and yes he should but his name

1043
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:09,735
was adult disease why don't more celebrities

1044
00:36:09,735 --> 00:36:12,015
run for president because we found like

it like anyone could but that's there

1049
00:36:22,125 --> 00:36:24,225
was like after trump there was like

1050
00:36:24,225 --> 00:36:26,685
the spate of like all these fucking

1051
00:36:26,685 --> 00:36:28,395
people that had never been in politics

1052
00:36:28,515 --> 00:36:30,015
for of doing like i'm going to

1053
00:36:30,015 --> 00:36:31,905
run for office but well there all

1054
00:36:31,905 --> 00:36:33,375
your life that fame is better than

1055
00:36:33,375 --> 00:36:33,945
politics

1056
00:36:35,385 --> 00:36:37,035
why was it like incredibly famous and

1057
00:36:37,035 --> 00:36:38,895

00:36:53,145 --> 00:36:55,275
money being corrupt because the one thing
