left a real impression i'm sure it

132
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:14,190
was a man we're trying to do

133
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:16,620
this for kids now um i was

134
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:18,450
on a very busy street called los

135
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:21,630

heard of it i got on to

137
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,290
a bad juncture and that was on

138
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:27,870
me and so what happens is it's

139
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:29,610
three landed and narrow sure to

140
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,940
another juncture wouldn't be prudent it narrows

141
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:34,950
from three lanes to two lanes and

142
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:36,120
then of course there's all the people

143
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,010

144
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,780

always cars parked but then you can

148
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:47,070
go a long way exact cars pop

149
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:49,110
exactly and so i let someone in

150
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:50,070

but await but so they're counting on

394
00:14:16,245 --> 00:14:17,895
people not remembering that there was a

395
00:14:17,902 --> 00:14:20,685
joe millionaire dead premises this so the

396
00:14:20,685 --> 00:14:23,475
first year top screaming in me the

397
00:14:23,475 --> 00:14:25,005
first joe millionaire they didn't know until

398
00:14:25,005 --> 00:14:26,175
the end that he wasn't really a

399
00:14:26,175 --> 00:14:27,855
millionaire right so the whole time they

400
00:14:27,855 --> 00:14:29,985
thought he's a millionaire this time there's

401
00:14:30,105 --> 00:14:31,935
they surprised the woman there's two men

402
00:14:32,265 --> 00:14:33,705
and they said one is a millionaire

403
00:14:33,705 --> 00:14:34,245
and one

404
00:14:34,245 --> 00:14:35,925
it is not one is worth ten

405
00:14:35,925 --> 00:14:37,815
million dollars and one is worth not

406
00:14:37,845 --> 00:14:40,155
so jimmy a millionaire and no millionaire

407
00:14:40,335 --> 00:14:41,955
yeah basically and then they both they

408
00:14:41,955 --> 00:14:42,795

409
00:14:42,795 --> 00:14:43,815

the dollars actually right right right right

477
00:16:52,035 --> 00:16:52,965

good selling point for a bachelor it's

486
00:17:06,345 --> 00:17:07,515
also just tough even if you met

487
00:17:07,515 --> 00:17:08,475

because of demand no demand is going

579

580
00:19:54,885 --> 00:19:56,835

865
00:29:36,170 --> 00:29:38,000
smaller one never mind

866
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:39,860
to think that

867
00:29:41,210 --> 00:29:44,210
alright that's fine why does that why

868
00:29:44,210 --> 00:29:45,500
do they even make the big ones

869
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:47,660
then are you are you like drawing

870
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:49,580
a comic yes

871
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,600
i read a book recently yes all

872
00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:56,754
on what i'd like to do more

873
00:29:56,754 --> 00:29:58,130
wrote a book what was the book

874
00:29:58,130 --> 00:29:58,880
you read do you want to talk

875
00:29:58,910 --> 00:30:01,430
about it oh that it's a private

876
00:30:01,430 --> 00:30:01,700
book

877
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,710
it was a book called the thursday

878
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:09,920
murder club and was very enjoyable book

879
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,390
but the thing is there were it

880
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:15,260
shifted between um perspectives so there was

881
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:18,470
like a third person last tool exactly

882
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:20,330
so there was a third person perspective

883
00:30:20,330 --> 00:30:21,410
but then there was a first person

884
00:30:21,410 --> 00:30:22,910
perspective in the form of a journal

885
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:27,345
doctors and lawyers ca what's that what's

886
00:30:27,345 --> 00:30:29,205
it what what chomsky harriet the spy

887
00:30:29,535 --> 00:30:32,205
which helps which ascii tom hanks movie

888
00:30:33,255 --> 00:30:36,675
library cloud atlas cloud atlas i believe

889
00:30:36,675 --> 00:30:37,785
the book is sort of like that

890
00:30:37,785 --> 00:30:38,955
is not i do not know i

891
00:30:38,955 --> 00:30:39,885
have not read it nor have i

892
00:30:39,885 --> 00:30:42,165
seen the film neither have i but

893
00:30:42,165 --> 00:30:43,785
the thing is when they switched perspect

894
00:30:43,785 --> 00:30:46,305
gives the journal was a different font

895
00:30:46,425 --> 00:30:48,705
whoa not writing much smut it wasn't

896
00:30:48,915 --> 00:30:51,105
necessary it wasn't really handwriting but it

897
00:30:51,105 --> 00:30:52,515
was so much smaller than the other

898
00:30:52,515 --> 00:30:53,925
one that i had to constant cause

899
00:30:53,925 --> 00:30:55,455
i was reading on a cat's annoy

900
00:30:55,515 --> 00:30:57,615
i keep bumping it up yeah and

901
00:30:57,615 --> 00:30:58,755
then when i would go back to

902
00:30:58,755 --> 00:31:00,315
the the third person font it was

903
00:31:00,315 --> 00:31:02,445
now so big that it was a

904
00:31:02,445 --> 00:31:03,945
quietly mortified show

905
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:07,035
should it should use a tor yeah

906
00:31:07,095 --> 00:31:07,935
it was like this is good enough

907
00:31:07,965 --> 00:31:09,765
for you as well it should account

908
00:31:09,765 --> 00:31:11,865
for your text size on the first

909
00:31:11,865 --> 00:31:14,205

982
00:33:52,248 --> 00:33:52,635
boys

983
00:33:52,665 --> 00:33:52,965
her

984
00:33:54,587 --> 00:33:56,175
six months yeah

985
00:33:56,505 --> 00:33:58,815
was gonna do the madness but ah

986
00:33:58,935 --> 00:34:02,475
six pumps and me odd udi you're

987
00:34:02,475 --> 00:34:04,335
going to be challenging but it's it's

988
00:34:04,335 --> 00:34:06,105
getting more and more fun for me

989
00:34:06,105 --> 00:34:07,485
because first of all i feel better

990
00:34:07,485 --> 00:34:10,215
physically which is helping but i she's

991
00:34:10,215 --> 00:34:12,135
getting so funny and she's so yeah

992
00:34:12,315 --> 00:34:13,665
what do you hope her first word

993
00:34:13,665 --> 00:34:15,075
is i would love for it to

994
00:34:15,075 --> 00:34:17,805
be mama really when there are deals

995
00:34:18,135 --> 00:34:18,795
updates

996
00:34:19,065 --> 00:34:23,445
other than car but isn't mama what's

997
00:34:24,135 --> 00:34:25,935
there to say right yeah data is

998
00:34:25,965 --> 00:34:27,375
easier to change your name to data

999
00:34:27,465 --> 00:34:29,775
yeah she's saying that by accident yeah

1000
00:34:29,805 --> 00:34:31,365
we your people are just saying oh

1001
00:34:31,365 --> 00:34:32,715
he oh they said they said it

1002
00:34:32,745 --> 00:34:34,665
now no no no they have to

1003
00:34:34,965 --> 00:34:36,735
i think it's if it's data if

1004
00:34:36,735 --> 00:34:38,205
it's mama it's like it's obviously you're

1005
00:34:38,205 --> 00:34:39,165
saying me if it's

1006
00:34:39,225 --> 00:34:40,935
gotta they have to include a point

1007
00:34:41,025 --> 00:34:42,435
in like sort of a they have

1008
00:34:42,435 --> 00:34:44,175
a gesture like a repeated gesture like

1009
00:34:44,175 --> 00:34:45,765
know this person well you know a

1010
00:34:45,773 --> 00:34:46,965
part of it is i have to

1011
00:34:46,965 --> 00:34:49,035
start calling us that now i guess

1012
00:34:49,035 --> 00:34:50,415
because she has no she's not gonna

1013
00:34:50,415 --> 00:34:51,975
say ma mushin which isn't i don't

1014
00:34:51,975 --> 00:34:54,885
often say mama right what do you

1015
00:34:54,885 --> 00:34:56,655
say lauren i don't say anything i

1016
00:34:56,655 --> 00:34:58,785
just i don't never tell her to

1017
00:34:58,785 --> 00:34:59,385
come to mom i

1018
00:34:59,391 --> 00:35:01,005
don't speak a word to her

1019
00:35:03,135 --> 00:35:05,265
ask her why i've said it i've

1020
00:35:05,265 --> 00:35:06,435
tried to make a point because now

1021
00:35:06,435 --> 00:35:07,665
she's at the point where six months

1022
00:35:07,665 --> 00:35:08,535
is where they start to learn their

1023
00:35:08,535 --> 00:35:10,545
own name so you have to be

1024
00:35:10,545 --> 00:35:12,855
more specific so you call her nicknames

1025
00:35:12,855 --> 00:35:14,175
and stuff you'd be more specific you

1026
00:35:14,205 --> 00:35:16,485
call the specific name and then she'll

1027
00:35:16,485 --> 00:35:18,455
start to recognize that means her and

1028
00:35:18,455 --> 00:35:20,445
then so that's i would say probably

1029
00:35:20,445 --> 00:35:21,375
now is a good time to start

1030
00:35:21,375 --> 00:35:22,005
putting in that

1031
00:35:22,215 --> 00:35:24,435
he's that and i'm some bubble oh

1032
00:35:24,435 --> 00:35:25,935
right yeah so you don't feel like

1033
00:35:25,935 --> 00:35:26,925
you have to stop calling your dip

1034
00:35:26,925 --> 00:35:29,355
shit yeah yeah she'll start figuring out

1035
00:35:29,625 --> 00:35:31,539
what we're talking about oh what if

1036
00:35:31,575 --> 00:35:34,785
we came over to record and now

1037
00:35:34,785 --> 00:35:36,435
we haven't seen her since like week

1038
00:35:36,495 --> 00:35:38,295

some kind of stressful to have a

1134
00:38:52,065 --> 00:38:53,625
bunch of sheep you have to like

1135
00:38:53,865 --> 00:38:54,795

00:38:59,775 --> 00:39:01,275
okay anyway if i were a sheep

1140
00:39:01,275 --> 00:39:03,795

00:39:11,685 --> 00:39:14,535
this garage often and it was a

1146
00:39:14,535 --> 00:39:16,995
very um scary thing to go up

1147
00:39:16,995 --> 00:39:18,045
to the garage

1148
00:39:18,375 --> 00:39:19,305
to the point where the dog would

1149
00:39:19,305 --> 00:39:21,495
sense you outside because then it would

1150
00:39:21,495 --> 00:39:23,175
like jump up in the windows little

1151
00:39:23,175 --> 00:39:25,365
willow garage and it was like it

1152
00:39:25,365 --> 00:39:26,325
was like there was a monster in

1153
00:39:26,325 --> 00:39:27,915
there because it would not it wasn't

1154
00:39:27,915 --> 00:39:29,535
tall enough to stay in the window

1155
00:39:29,805 --> 00:39:31,305
but it would jump up just barking

1156
00:39:31,305 --> 00:39:34,605
like crazy scary it was a horrifying

1157
00:39:34,635 --> 00:39:35,685

to have a big dog like that

1179
00:40:17,565 --> 00:40:19,065

00:42:45,330 --> 00:42:47,850
the best one of the coolest things

1257
00:42:47,850 --> 00:42:50,430
our society does is is public schooling

1258
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,430
yeah but the teachers are paid two

1259
00:42:53,430 --> 00:42:55,530
cents and no i mean yes we

1260
00:42:55,530 --> 00:42:56,940
should put more money into it but

1261
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:58,680
it's like it's it's honestly like when

1262
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:00,120
you think about it and amazing thing

1263
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:01,470

bum you out now it's great well

1287
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:47,600
because holly's going to school in a

00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:49,260
mere four and a half years i

1289
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:51,120
know they're trying to take care of

1290
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:52,710
all these issues legitimate question are you

1291
00:43:52,710 --> 00:43:53,910
already having to look at shit like

1293
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:57,750
you like probably by the time she's

1294
00:43:57,750 --> 00:43:58,830

1295
00:43:58,830 --> 00:43:59,610

kid to be embarrassed self-conscious about much

1317
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:37,295

had either just broke us sandwiches growing

1377
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:26,790

get to school like i would have

1381
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:32,460
my sandwich with turkey and then i'd

1382
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:34,650
get there like the turkey yeah yeah

1383
00:46:35,130 --> 00:46:37,530
alone oh man my ma butter i

1387
00:46:43,620 --> 00:46:45,750

once and put them in the freezer

1389
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:50,010
whoa and then i would set them

1390
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:52,800
stay at oh it does here's why

1391
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:55,020
it doesn't work because what you should

1392
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:56,550
do is you take the next day

1393
00:46:56,550 --> 00:46:58,530
sandwich out the night before right and

1394
00:46:58,530 --> 00:46:59,310
you put it in the fridge

1395
00:46:59,310 --> 00:47:01,140
age yeah so that it thaws out

1396
00:47:01,350 --> 00:47:02,550
and then you could put condiments on

1397
00:47:02,550 --> 00:47:04,050
it or whatever yeah common instead of

1398
00:47:04,050 --> 00:47:06,288
what i did i put all bunnymen

1399
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:09,200
big condom it's like putting soda in

1400
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:11,640
tinfoil i would forget about it until

1401
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:12,720
the morning i would grab it out

1402
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:14,010
of the freezer in the morning so

1405
00:47:17,310 --> 00:47:18,510

1417
00:47:41,070 --> 00:47:42,240
keep up with production and they didn't

1418
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:43,710
expect it at all it looks like

1419
00:47:43,710 --> 00:47:45,390
baloney or it looks like it's just

1420
00:47:45,390 --> 00:47:46,800
one of those sheet masks but it's

1421
00:47:47,100 --> 00:47:48,480
but a red circle and it looks

1422
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:49,860
like money comes in an oscar meyer

1423
00:47:49,860 --> 00:47:51,990

imagine a turkey in a pic and

1509
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:41,550
a ham that's just respectful that would

1510
00:50:41,550 --> 00:50:44,070
be awesome i don't know i guess

1511
00:50:44,070 --> 00:50:45,360
it was a combination of turkey and

00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:46,740
ham i don't know but it is

1513
00:50:46,740 --> 00:50:48,240
