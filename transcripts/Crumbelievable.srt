558
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:05,180
ah a song cannot be a rock

559
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:07,340
and roll song unless it has x

560
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:10,745
yeah insane but i also remember when

561
00:20:10,745 --> 00:20:12,065
i want to play what i was

562
00:20:12,065 --> 00:20:14,105
doing i was told to put to

563
00:20:14,135 --> 00:20:16,535
you the clarinet first as a warmup

564
00:20:16,535 --> 00:20:18,065
instrument to learn the sex about when

565
00:20:18,065 --> 00:20:19,445
i was in fifth or sixth grade

566
00:20:19,715 --> 00:20:20,585
and then i play the clarinet and

567
00:20:20,585 --> 00:20:22,085
i was horrible i never got anything

568
00:20:22,085 --> 00:20:24,695
better maybe a saxophone was more expensive

569
00:20:24,755 --> 00:20:25,805
and they were like let's just tell

570
00:20:25,805 --> 00:20:27,455
her because made of brass i rented

571
00:20:27,455 --> 00:20:27,665
it

572
00:20:28,865 --> 00:20:31,775
oh my brother rented an accordion i

573
00:20:31,775 --> 00:20:34,595
remember this having to go to accordion

574
00:20:34,655 --> 00:20:36,965
lessons even though i wasn't taking it

575
00:20:36,965 --> 00:20:38,405
but my mom was like make me

576
00:20:38,405 --> 00:20:39,425
go to

577
00:20:40,835 --> 00:20:42,485
because there's something for you to do

578
00:20:42,605 --> 00:20:44,105
well yeah like well like she needed

579
00:20:44,105 --> 00:20:45,961
to watch me yeah and she needed

580
00:20:45,961 --> 00:20:47,315
to drive him so i just she

581
00:20:47,315 --> 00:20:48,245
had to sit there and wait for

582
00:20:48,245 --> 00:20:49,115
him she had to sit there and

583
00:20:49,115 --> 00:20:50,495
wait for him so i just remember

584
00:20:50,555 --> 00:20:52,625
and this is like nineteen seventy five

585
00:20:52,625 --> 00:20:54,455
i think nineteen seventy six just like

586
00:20:54,455 --> 00:20:56,251
this video screens have been invented yet

587
00:20:56,299 --> 00:20:57,845
there's nothing else to do yeah i

588
00:20:57,845 --> 00:20:59,285
just remember that that scene that was

589
00:20:59,285 --> 00:21:00,725
my whole childhood is being in

590
00:21:00,725 --> 00:21:02,405
the seventy s going to drug stores

591
00:21:02,435 --> 00:21:04,325
and accordion lessons and just like sitting

592
00:21:04,355 --> 00:21:06,065
around a station wagon you just had

593
00:21:06,065 --> 00:21:07,175
to wait around all the time i

594
00:21:07,175 --> 00:21:08,435
was always waiting in the car or

595
00:21:08,435 --> 00:21:10,355
like hiding in the clothes at the

596
00:21:10,355 --> 00:21:12,095
store oh yeah i would do that

597
00:21:12,095 --> 00:21:14,765
too never like carpet stores too yeah

598
00:21:14,825 --> 00:21:16,084
yeah you died in the close but

599
00:21:16,084 --> 00:21:18,365
yeah rhymes going to like um like

600
00:21:18,365 --> 00:21:20,195
the upholstery but i feel like that

601
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:20,855
was like a place where

602
00:21:20,915 --> 00:21:22,085
went to a lot with fabric stores

603
00:21:22,115 --> 00:21:23,405
fabric store but when they do the

604
00:21:23,405 --> 00:21:24,875
curtains and the things yeah so then

605
00:21:24,875 --> 00:21:26,405
i'd be so bored because it was

606
00:21:26,405 --> 00:21:28,235
the most boring shit editor well yeah

607
00:21:28,235 --> 00:21:29,525
there's nothing for a kid to look

608
00:21:29,525 --> 00:21:30,815
at at a fabric store i remember

609
00:21:30,815 --> 00:21:32,045
going to my mlis you're interested in

610
00:21:32,045 --> 00:21:34,265

michael seven ads

615
00:21:41,075 --> 00:21:43,175
michael michael doesn't have an apostrophe doesn't

616
00:21:43,775 --> 00:21:45,095
i don't fucking know i needed as

617
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:47,285
ralph's that's right and you know why

618
00:21:47,585 --> 00:21:48,867
because it was more expensive think to

619
00:21:48,895 --> 00:21:52,115
sign the apostrophe exactly far more expensive

620
00:21:52,145 --> 00:21:55,505
really don't be cheap put the apostrophe

621
00:21:55,565 --> 00:21:58,145
dbc pga have isos before i thought

622
00:21:58,145 --> 00:21:59,465
this a million times if i had

623
00:21:59,465 --> 00:22:01,147
a business you're like even if i

624
00:22:01,205 --> 00:22:02,855
a mcdonald's franchise or something like that

625
00:22:02,855 --> 00:22:04,115
like if you had ah even yeah

626
00:22:04,355 --> 00:22:05,465
but i'm saying i wouldn't call that

627
00:22:05,465 --> 00:22:07,025
my own business like maybe it is

628
00:22:07,025 --> 00:22:08,045
i don't know but i think you're

629
00:22:08,045 --> 00:22:09,935
a small business owner if you frankly

630
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:11,345
somebody asked you what you do for

631
00:22:11,345 --> 00:22:13,025
a living that's your business okay i

632
00:22:13,025 --> 00:22:14,285
run sales is big don't do it

633
00:22:14,555 --> 00:22:16,325
oh i had a store but this

634
00:22:16,325 --> 00:22:17,435
but i usually think about when i

635
00:22:17,465 --> 00:22:20,045
think about fast food when the lights

636
00:22:20,075 --> 00:22:21,305
are out of the

637
00:22:21,725 --> 00:22:24,575
don't sing that song when the lights

638
00:22:25,235 --> 00:22:26,135
i don't know it's i think you

639
00:22:26,135 --> 00:22:28,681
make everything it goes out on in

640
00:22:28,681 --> 00:22:31,175
the day yeah oh

641
00:22:32,705 --> 00:22:35,465
huh think about when there's a big

642
00:22:35,495 --> 00:22:36,995
m and then part of it's greenway

643
00:22:37,025 --> 00:22:38,705
give me a minute think about when

644
00:22:38,705 --> 00:22:39,905
it's happening and it's great because the

645
00:22:39,905 --> 00:22:41,900
light is out behind that yeah you

646
00:22:41,915 --> 00:22:44,255
are doing this already would be to

647
00:22:44,255 --> 00:22:47,495
replace any light bulbs in the signs

648
00:22:47,495 --> 00:22:49,325
on my business are you running for

649
00:22:49,325 --> 00:22:49,835
mcdonnell

650
00:22:51,665 --> 00:22:55,445
yeah we already are mcmc but yeah

651
00:22:55,466 --> 00:22:56,525
i would because i always think it

652
00:22:56,525 --> 00:22:57,935
looks like dirty when they don't have

653
00:22:57,935 --> 00:23:00,215
that right and then i'm thinking this

654
00:23:00,215 --> 00:23:01,745
isn't a great establishment even though of

655
00:23:01,745 --> 00:23:03,665

656
00:23:03,665 --> 00:23:05,075

during the bang bang writers room of

968
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:08,300
lakeman the world's biggest slider which happened

970
00:34:15,770 --> 00:34:19,040

write like a crackers

972
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:23,900
there's not much more to it just

973
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:26,176
probably why it ended up not being

974
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:27,470
a sketch but it was a funny

975
00:34:27,470 --> 00:34:28,430
concept development

1019
00:35:53,930 --> 00:35:55,640
the next time we do we shouldn't

1020
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:57,590

1022
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:02,420
discussion now yeah oh this is this

1023
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:05,240
new business we gotta finish all business

1024
00:36:05,270 --> 00:36:07,790
first we gotta talk about something else

1025
00:36:07,970 --> 00:36:08,262
okay

1026
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,950
have to switch it up now did

1027
00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:11,570
you guys ever have clubs like we

1028
00:36:11,570 --> 00:36:13,070
had a clubhouse that my dad built

1029
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:15,140
for us the chef did you have

1030
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:17,630
to do the president vice president like

1031
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:19,250
that seemed to have to or get

1032
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:20,780
to that seem to be all clubhouse

1033
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:22,310
business was deciding who is going to

1034
00:36:22,310 --> 00:36:23,630
do the specials and then you take

1035
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:25,550
the minutes and the secretary always got

1036
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:27,261
the worst part of it because secretary

1037
00:36:27,261 --> 00:36:28,490
and student council i took the mini

1038
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:29,990
it's because the secretary had to write

1039
00:36:29,990 --> 00:36:31,760
everything down meanwhile the president gets to

1040
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,560
be popular and do nothing vice president

1041
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:35,060
gets to do absolutely nothing and then

1042
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:37,040
treasurer keeps money of which there is

1043
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,780

be substitute teachers okay that's a good

1145
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,350
idea as a trio you know what

was a substitute teacher for a while

1150
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:37,850
and she had like a consistent class

1151
00:40:37,850 --> 00:40:40,040
because the teacher had to have happened

1152
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:41,780
and it was right yeah well that

1153
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:42,170
