00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:00,630
title

00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:09,120

6
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,820

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,320
and took something it means

8
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:33,780
it's like an alert alert alert alert

9
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:35,940
jack wiring test for me when you

10
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:37,560
were a kid yeah i remember him

11
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,240
from when i'm going to adult i

12
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,800
had to ah it's awesome to get

13
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:44,100
your hearing checked ah relatively recently wow

14
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:45,390
i haven't i guess i should do

15
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:46,650
it it seems like a good idea

16
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:48,420
yeah i had it i examined their

17
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:49,680
day which of course i do annual

18
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,780
ali i mean yeah um and i

19
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:52,950
had to get my eyes dilated which

20
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:54,480
is always the worst because your eyes

21
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,860
right now they have those dollar signs

22
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:57,090
in them yeah because you were just

23
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:59,370
looking at ah paul i'm trying to

24
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:01,620
sell them yeah i can just see

25
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:03,240
i want to get and it's quite

26
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:04,800
alluring i see a big roast chicken

27
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:07,140
yeah so we're a different places huh

28
00:01:07,146 --> 00:01:07,710
see

29
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:11,910
okay it can be both um but

30
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:13,620
now think about selling the chicken how

31
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:16,680
like nice suits to dollar signs for

32
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,020
paul my eyes anymore

33
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:24,180
my doctor told me last year i

34
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:27,060
doctor told me you're better i thought

35
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:28,800
it was like i said dean tang

36
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,140
while being being my doctor my doctor

37
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:34,968
told me your pupils i'll die lay

38
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,830
they're gun feel sticky and that's my

39
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:39,660
favorite part of getting dig the drops

40
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:41,520
we like sticky in the cruise two

41
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,040
drops you liked that part um and

42
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:46,980
she cares she told me you really

43
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:48,720
like i do it gives me what

44
00:01:48,723 --> 00:01:50,340
i'm like i don't like any of

45
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,830
the the process but last year she

46
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:54,510
told me that my contact lenses i've

47
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:56,850
been wearing contexts since i was fourteen

48
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,620
i have had glasses since i was

49
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:00,000
eight wow

50
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,850
she told me and i haven't worn

51
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:04,230
the same exact ones the whole time

52
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:05,640
but i yeah that would be weird

53
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,750
if you were the same pair of

54
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:09,750
glasses roll glasses i mean my contacts

55
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:12,150
i i eventually swearing her of god

56
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,430
i started wearing dailies many years ago

57
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,260
yeah and then last year she told

58
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:18,240
me she's like a new doctor that

59
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,800
i was seeing she was like these

60
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,160
cons

61
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,270
next just you know like do you

62
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:22,110
like these and i was like yeah

63
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:23,280
and she's like these are like the

64
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,960
iphone four of contacts and i was

65
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:28,860
like wow i should not be wearing

66
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:31,050
these oh and it was no one

67
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:32,190
because everyone just always says are they

68
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:33,360
okay like you like come and i'm

69
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,400
like meaning though that they're now upgrade

70
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:37,410
now they're thinner they're lighter they're better

71
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:39,720
there now and so i got the

72
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,320
new ones

73
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:42,210
and this because last year i got

74
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:43,710
a different new one i realised oh

75
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:44,580
it wasn't the one she was talking

76
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:45,720
about this year i got the right

77
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,330
one and i put them in amazing

78
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,943
really i can feel the difference and

79
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:52,380
feel like your eyes are being kissed

80
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:54,900
by these cons by god and god

81
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,870
i also my prescriptions my prescriptions so

82
00:02:57,879 --> 00:03:00,480
very bad my right i got by

83
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,480
better why right eye contacts know right

84
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:06,870
i got better that's because i contact

85
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:07,560
no

86
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,020
as you're getting older your eyes get

87
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:14,550
worse and worse my but and then

88
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:16,740
at a certain point your your eye

89
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:18,480
like around this age even secure i

90
00:03:18,497 --> 00:03:21,900

93
00:03:26,649 --> 00:03:28,470

risk that's a breakup the floater and

123
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,020
then you have a million more and

124
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:21,000

170
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,540
all gross okay um but yeah i

171
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:05,940
it was only recently that i was

172
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:07,260
like this has been going on for

173
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:09,300
a while and maybe it's a serious

174
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,860
issue well yeah when i had this

175
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,360
floater i got really scared because i

176
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,860
was seeing it for like a week

177
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:15,002
and then going like oh god what

178
00:06:15,002 --> 00:06:17,250
does this is like something and then

179
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:18,420
i went in and they were just

180
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:19,470
you and you could see it on

181
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:20,280
the thing which is very

182
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,810
validating like when i do that you're

183
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:23,370
not crazy well yeah like in their

184
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:25,560
cars and then everyone's everyone already gaslight

185
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,850
you that there was no floater well

186
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:28,230
because it seems like it's just a

187
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:30,270
figment of your imagination it doesn't feel

188
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:31,920
like it's a thing in your eye

189
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:34,650
yes like the exact see yeah and

190
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:36,030
so it's very interesting that it's like

191
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:37,470
no it's just some debris because it's

192
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:38,820
sort of like you're you see a

193
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:40,560
thing in the slight disk

194
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,740

during your visions yeah right yeah there

196
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:47,820

kinda lives in my brain and there

228
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:47,100

cola i haven't seen that one i

236
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:05,700
used to be i used to be

237
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:07,500
current with all of the pixar's and

238
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,550
there's a few now that i mean

239
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:10,500
i've been turning red and learning but

240
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,060
i love that her disguise i don't

241
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:12,690
think that's pixar

242
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,227
though it's not that's just dreamworks no

243
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,970
no just disney disney now oh rising

244
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:21,120
the that style of animation okay but

245
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,860
i will say the one thing like

246
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:25,170
with soul and inside out and all

247
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:27,780
this it's like pixar they're very interested

248
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:30,810
in like these undefinable concepts like putting

249
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:32,400
rules on them like i don't know

250
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:32,880
if you say yeah

251
00:08:32,975 --> 00:08:34,950
so like okay so you need a

252
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:37,770
patch that like it's like like these

253
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:39,660
are unexplainable explainable concepts we don't need

254
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:43,410
to like you know confine what's interesting

255
00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:45,750
because for movie you do though that's

256
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:46,710
the part i don't like about it

257
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:47,910
is like here are the rules for

258
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,320
to get back your soul you need

259
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,460
five patches

260
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:53,370
but full patches i know it was

261
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,500
it was just as valid as

262
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:58,950
any beliefs that well that's the that's

263
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:00,210
the problem is they're trying to start

264
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:01,710
their own religion i don't like it

265
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:04,500
because i'm a scientologist to say i

266
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:05,850
want to cut that and use that

267
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:07,740
i have to say that i can

268
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:09,030
use one when you said i'm a

269
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:10,470
scientologist to be a quote that will

270
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:12,720
oh because she's all right

271
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,850
a once and use twice you're gonna

272
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:15,900
cut it out of the episode but

273
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:18,387
then use it like i just said

274
00:09:18,387 --> 00:09:20,070
it in real life no one can

275
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:22,260
ever cut or use that okay um

276
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:24,750
but the movie soul i really liked

277
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:26,010
and mike and i were watching that

278
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:28,440
were like sobbing and this was like

279
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:30,210
early pandemic i wanna say my comment

280
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:31,950
i mean definitely came out on christmas

281
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:32,850
when wonder woman night

282
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,398
eighty four yes okay so it was

283
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:35,940
a definitely do it was a pandemic

284
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:37,920
because we watched both of those alone

285
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,390
it was the first christmas after the

286
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:42,390
during the pin yeah and i loved

287
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:43,680
it but then i as you're saying

288
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,110
this i'm thinking okay if a child

289
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:49,650
is getting education from this yeah about

290
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,990
death they're gonna think that they when

291
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:53,040
they die they need to get

292
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,690
at five patches well it won't matter

293
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:57,150
then but i think that the idea

294
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:59,370
that you have an image in your

295
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:00,840
brain of what it looks like that's

296
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,370
a little confusing to me like if

297
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:04,230
let's say somebody they knew died then

298
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:06,062
they're like picturing the little green world

299
00:10:06,062 --> 00:10:07,200
and all these things that are happening

300
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,094
in that and like i don't know

301
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:09,300
yeah is that good almost just the

302
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:12,150
sole way again six grams i'm saying

303
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:13,200
grams twenty four

304
00:10:13,905 --> 00:10:17,085
grams between one and one million grams

305
00:10:17,085 --> 00:10:18,588
we can agree on that right golden

306
00:10:18,645 --> 00:10:20,735
theory how much does the soul way

307
00:10:20,805 --> 00:10:22,545
so the soul is worth it's weight

308
00:10:22,545 --> 00:10:24,015
in golden grahams

309
00:10:25,845 --> 00:10:27,735
the key is soul weighs two thousand

310
00:10:27,825 --> 00:10:31,125
eight hundred two pounds oh okay but

311
00:10:31,125 --> 00:10:33,495

00:10:33,495 --> 00:10:36,465

00:13:00,555 --> 00:13:02,205
her for being there and she stared

373
00:13:02,205 --> 00:13:03,945
service this i thanked her for her

374
00:13:03,946 --> 00:13:06,195
service i saluted her i presented her

375
00:13:06,195 --> 00:13:08,655
with a folded flag you always carry

376
00:13:08,655 --> 00:13:10,425
went around i always and it never

377
00:13:10,425 --> 00:13:12,345
touches the ground never

378
00:13:12,435 --> 00:13:13,815
because i burn it yeah but it's

379
00:13:13,815 --> 00:13:15,375
always one inch above the ground that

380
00:13:15,705 --> 00:13:18,105
early yeah because it's imagined burning it

381
00:13:19,755 --> 00:13:21,645
i'm flag edging yeah isn't burning it

382
00:13:21,645 --> 00:13:23,205
like a little bit dramatic it's sort

383
00:13:23,205 --> 00:13:25,997
of like ruining something so focused like

384
00:13:25,997 --> 00:13:26,925
guys you could just throw it on

385
00:13:26,925 --> 00:13:30,045
the ground saying the idea of flags

386
00:13:30,045 --> 00:13:31,875
being so secret is so funny it's

387
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:33,645
really like a little yeah and it's

388
00:13:33,645 --> 00:13:35,745
only because everyone says they have to

389
00:13:35,745 --> 00:13:38,085
be that way yeah but but it's

390
00:13:38,085 --> 00:13:39,015
a law like

391
00:13:39,315 --> 00:13:41,475
yeah it's crazy thinking is a law

392
00:13:41,505 --> 00:13:43,725
that's stupid oh saw you trip and

393
00:13:43,725 --> 00:13:45,225
fall holding a flag in public so

394
00:13:45,735 --> 00:13:46,785
i don't think it's wrong because i

395
00:13:46,785 --> 00:13:47,895
think you can do whatever you want

396
00:13:48,075 --> 00:13:50,025
but if you're in the army or

397
00:13:50,745 --> 00:13:52,095
navy i don't want to wind up

398
00:13:52,095 --> 00:13:53,505
on bad legal takes i don't think

399
00:13:53,505 --> 00:13:56,595
it's a law anyway yeah banks dot

400
00:13:56,715 --> 00:13:58,305
org yeah don't work

401
00:13:59,565 --> 00:14:04,095

nice it's very fun yeah very funny

481
00:16:52,305 --> 00:16:54,465
really it's a weird thing and again

482
00:16:54,945 --> 00:16:57,045
you guys voted to call yourself that

483
00:16:57,075 --> 00:16:58,545
that's the thing i explained that to

484
00:16:58,545 --> 00:16:59,955
ari shapiro and everyone i was

485
00:16:59,955 --> 00:17:02,565
like i don't like this personally yeah

486
00:17:02,595 --> 00:17:04,125
but we have to abide by the

487
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:05,745
vote because what are we if not

488
00:17:05,745 --> 00:17:07,545
a democracy it's hard as you know

489
00:17:07,545 --> 00:17:09,165
is hard when you as a journalist

490
00:17:09,165 --> 00:17:10,665
should understand that i think when you

491
00:17:10,665 --> 00:17:12,435
create something you can go to places

492
00:17:12,435 --> 00:17:13,815
you weren't expecting and yeah part of

493
00:17:13,815 --> 00:17:14,955
what it is to be an artist

494
00:17:14,955 --> 00:17:15,585
and i think that we have to

495
00:17:15,585 --> 00:17:16,621
accept that you guys want to be

496
00:17:16,621 --> 00:17:17,982
called a piss pig and you can't

497
00:17:17,982 --> 00:17:19,275
put the frankenstein back in the box

498
00:17:19,305 --> 00:17:19,875
yeah

499
00:17:20,145 --> 00:17:21,315
but you can't put the doctor back

500
00:17:21,315 --> 00:17:22,995
in the bag you can't put baby

501
00:17:22,995 --> 00:17:25,665
in a corner you can't you mustn't

502
00:17:25,755 --> 00:17:28,035
you can though nobody but nobody no

503
00:17:28,035 --> 00:17:30,495
nobody not sure that's what nobody does

504
00:17:30,525 --> 00:17:31,965
nobody does but you can do it

505
00:17:32,025 --> 00:17:34,755
it's totally absolutely physically impossible but just

506
00:17:34,755 --> 00:17:37,125
nobody does it nobody does yeah why

507
00:17:37,605 --> 00:17:39,645
why would you you gotta wonder

508
00:17:40,275 --> 00:17:42,885
guess it would feel anti-climactic like suddenly

509
00:17:42,885 --> 00:17:43,965
it's like oh look babies in the

510
00:17:43,965 --> 00:17:47,115
corner yeah well i've always i've always

511
00:17:47,115 --> 00:17:49,575
wondered what that would look like i

512
00:17:49,575 --> 00:17:51,285
guess i could picture in my mind

513
00:17:54,255 --> 00:17:54,585

686
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:55,500

00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,060
twenty four one bucks at twenty six

688
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:58,560

i got two that were twenty four

690
00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:02,430
so it's actually forty eight bag hit

691
00:24:02,490 --> 00:24:04,140

692
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:05,280
for this was like a dollar a

693
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:05,970
bag at that point

694
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:09,000
ooh okay so you spent fifty dollars

695
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,220
on this forty eight dollars yeah don't

696
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:12,060
you go to the store and buy

697
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:14,040
shit and spend fifty bucks i don't

698
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:16,230
i've never spent more than thirty three

699
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:17,910
dollars at the store wow at any

700
00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:19,890
store same i bring thirty three dollars

701
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:22,110
exactly in cash that's that seems really

702
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:23,730
hard and what sucks is i don't

703
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:26,040
look at the prices then i yeah

704
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:27,270
you know the the

705
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:28,530
cashier will ring it up and i'll

706
00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:29,970
say can you take that off please

707
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:31,860
because i have yeah it's like fill

708
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:33,210
a card and i tell you though

709
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:34,920
i'm no i've talked about this that

710
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,300
i had a friend whose father would

711
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:40,140
do that at the supermarket and would

712
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,247
like they'd ring it up and it

713
00:24:41,247 --> 00:24:43,020
would be like one hundred and fifty

714
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:45,060
five dollars and he'd say i'll give

715
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:47,430
you a hundred for ah

716
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:50,220
this sounds vaguely familiar and half the

717
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:53,130
time uncle at the half time they

718
00:24:53,130 --> 00:24:54,540
would call the manager over and just

719
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:57,630
be like okay because it was worth

720
00:24:57,630 --> 00:24:59,040
it to not have to it's too

721
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,450
annoying to put everything back on the

722
00:25:00,450 --> 00:25:02,010
ship because he would go like if

723
00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:02,970
you won't take one hundred then i'm

724
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:05,280
gonna just walk away and he would

725
00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:07,080
and have time would leave it all

726
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:07,590
there and

727
00:25:07,622 --> 00:25:09,000
walk away that's fucking it

728
00:25:10,337 --> 00:25:12,750
stores work i hate that but that's

729
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:13,950
how i found out you could do

730
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:14,970
it because half the time it would

731
00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:16,290
work people can do things that are

732
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:19,048
crazy all the time factly really it

733
00:25:19,048 --> 00:25:20,910
doesn't mean you should people get away

734
00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:21,990
with that's how i found out you

735
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:23,910
can break into someone's home i just

736
00:25:23,910 --> 00:25:25,260
and you can put baby i didn't

737
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:27,330
know you could and now i know

let's say there was a child in

759
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:15,390
the audience yeah yeah and was it

760
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:16,710
the first time they'd ever heard of

761
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:18,960
the concept i don't know i don't

762
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,190
know i'd like to think that it

763
00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:21,690
was you who introduced them by hope

764
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:23,340
so yeah and then it was pointed

765
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:24,600
out to me that because i think

766
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,850
she's like seven something like that she's

767
00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:30,120
like a young kid and i was

768
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:32,130
pointed out as i just said well

769
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:35,790
obviously i'm joking the mummies never die

770
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:37,871
yeah and this is what comedy is

771
00:26:37,871 --> 00:26:38,910
is you make things up so you

772
00:26:38,910 --> 00:26:41,220
may hate yum the idea of well

773
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:43,320
is ridiculous i started watching john melini

774
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:45,570
special other night and then he also

775
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:47,572
had a child in the audience who

776
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:49,470
has eleven he noticed the kid and

777
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:51,180
then they had an intersection was wearing

778
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:52,470
like a suit like he was

779
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:55,333
was he actually oh yeah i wouldn't

780
00:26:55,333 --> 00:26:57,270
yeah i know but then and then

781
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:59,340
what of july special like the the

782
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:00,660
comment he was making as he was

783
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:01,770
it was like this is like not

784
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:03,720
like his other specials where who would

785
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,160
bring the kid because it is that

786
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:07,260
question like if you're a fan you

787
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:08,610
kind of know where this one's gonna

788
00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:11,520

his paws going to go off the

792
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:16,260
rails i feel like you're kind of

793
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:17,640
a safe one though to bring a

794
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:20,340
kid to where you know your yeah

795
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,500
it doesn't feel like you would offend

796
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:23,730
so it doesn't feel like you're gonna

797
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:25,470

a little ditty about a time i

826
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:34,830
wrote my ca who here like graphic

827
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:35,550
violence

828
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:39,660
um but i i do i guess

829
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:42,420
i assume that if you're bringing your

830
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:46,140
kid you must assume that your kid

831
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:47,700
is cool with this yeah but i

832
00:28:47,737 --> 00:28:49,230
make an ass out of you and

833
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:51,360
them yeah absolutely how do you feel

834
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,950
about bringing me to a show when

835
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:55,980
she's seven yeah seven sure yeah wanna

836
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:56,790
yeah

837
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:58,560
will she be interested that's the real

838
00:28:58,650 --> 00:29:01,260
question i feel like yeah i didn't

839
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:02,880
want to bring a kid to anything

840
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,350
no i think can't sit still and

841
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:06,570
we brought cool up sister to the

842
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:07,890
bird and the be a great band

843
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:11,070
yeah when she was twenty and she

844
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:12,090
hated it so yeah

845
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,190
right because you have to be like

846
00:29:14,190 --> 00:29:15,960
this is our taste versus irritation i

847
00:29:15,973 --> 00:29:18,060
get bored but i always assume also

848
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:20,550
that these little kids are comedy fans

849
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:22,140
yeah and that's what i always assumed

850
00:29:22,147 --> 00:29:23,790
i thought because i was talking about

851
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:25,500
the millennia thing with my friend because

852
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:26,730
she was kind of like who brings

853
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,260
a kid that was going i could

854
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:31,110
see a being happy someone took me

855
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:33,240
at eleven absolutely because i liked gowdy

856
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:35,220
yeah yeah or if with my own

857
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:36,330
child i feel like i might go

858
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:37,980
you have some comedy show because when

859
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:39,660
you're yeah i've already said wrong you're

860
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:41,820
just being taken to all like the

861
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:44,160
world's worst entertainment usually right like you

862
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:45,194
i'm like let's go to the to

863
00:29:45,195 --> 00:29:48,090
go to the opera ya know i

864
00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:50,340
just mean like kids' shows are generally

865
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:51,840
terrible oh yeah i think that you

866
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,400
as a kid consensus that

867
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:54,930
they're bad well at a certain point

868
00:29:54,930 --> 00:29:56,673
yeah it isn't a corner eleven you

869
00:29:56,673 --> 00:29:57,870
would definitely be over any sort of

870
00:29:57,870 --> 00:30:00,120
cubase thing maybe funny if the opera

871
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,730

1050
00:36:08,275 --> 00:36:09,820
pride and it seems it's like one

1051
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:10,645
of the things you hear and it

1052
00:36:10,645 --> 00:36:11,365
seems impressive

1053
00:36:11,575 --> 00:36:12,411

00:36:12,411 --> 00:36:14,185

during the previous writers' strike it was

1060
00:36:22,195 --> 00:36:25,345
like he decided to go back while

00:36:25,345 --> 00:36:26,515
it was still going on and write

1062
00:36:26,515 --> 00:36:27,895
his own monologue even though i was

1063
00:36:27,895 --> 00:36:29,245
in the w j which i think

1064
00:36:29,245 --> 00:36:30,355
is a regret of his from what

1065
00:36:30,355 --> 00:36:31,705
i read but i mean

1066
00:36:31,765 --> 00:36:33,745
and his whole life filled with regret

1067
00:36:33,745 --> 00:36:35,215
this whole thing was well i want

1068
00:36:35,215 --> 00:36:36,385

00:36:36,385 --> 00:36:37,915

people did pay their their crews right

1072
00:36:43,555 --> 00:36:45,295
didn't go into that yeah yeah some

1073
00:36:45,295 --> 00:36:47,335
people do conan yeah conan did shows

1074
00:36:47,335 --> 00:36:48,805
and it was very much like an

1075
00:36:48,835 --> 00:36:50,335
unwritten thing where he was just like

1076
00:36:50,545 --> 00:36:51,805
fucking around and everything

1077
00:36:52,045 --> 00:36:54,475
yeah um and letterman i forgot about

1078
00:36:54,475 --> 00:36:56,095
this that letterman had worked out his

1079
00:36:56,095 --> 00:36:57,355
own deal yeah he worked on his

1080
00:36:57,355 --> 00:36:59,065
own deals he owns his own production

1081
00:36:59,065 --> 00:37:00,685
company that he owned so basically the

1082
00:37:00,685 --> 00:37:02,335
deal was hey whatever they agree to

1083
00:37:02,335 --> 00:37:05,194
we'll we'll do you know will you

1084
00:37:05,194 --> 00:37:06,865
do exactly what everyone agrees to what

1085
00:37:06,865 --> 00:37:08,605
isn't right well here's my point why

1086
00:37:08,605 --> 00:37:10,225
doesn't every company do that go whatever

1087
00:37:10,225 --> 00:37:11,785
we agree to will do it but

1088
00:37:11,785 --> 00:37:12,055
i don't

1089
00:37:12,085 --> 00:37:15,475
understand that retroactively able to he was

1090
00:37:15,475 --> 00:37:17,605
able to keep going because his his

1091
00:37:17,605 --> 00:37:19,165
show is an owned by cbs or

1092
00:37:19,165 --> 00:37:21,685
whatever like the big o he owned

1093
00:37:21,715 --> 00:37:22,915
his own show so he made it

1094
00:37:22,975 --> 00:37:26,005
oh so i do anyways size gab

1095
00:37:26,305 --> 00:37:28,165
he anyone can cut us ideal if

1096
00:37:28,165 --> 00:37:29,815
they want like nbc could go cut

1097
00:37:29,815 --> 00:37:31,045
their own deal right now yeah they

1098
00:37:31,045 --> 00:37:32,215
wanted there are rumors that

1099
00:37:32,245 --> 00:37:33,535
disney was going to do that yeah

1100
00:37:33,564 --> 00:37:34,915
vulgar disney was going to do yeah

1101
00:37:34,945 --> 00:37:36,715
because but they they feel like if

1102
00:37:36,715 --> 00:37:39,715
they band together they'll get more much

1103
00:37:39,715 --> 00:37:41,515

00:43:09,255 --> 00:43:11,235
it's it's against a wall it's

1248
00:43:11,265 --> 00:43:13,875
against an actual wall and so my

1249
00:43:14,115 --> 00:43:16,665
my school had a bunch of these

1250
00:43:16,665 --> 00:43:18,525
walls with like a little white line

1251
00:43:18,525 --> 00:43:22,335
painted wide line of approximately yea high

1252
00:43:22,365 --> 00:43:23,685
and then we would all play this

1253
00:43:23,685 --> 00:43:26,595
game and you had to it had

1254
00:43:26,595 --> 00:43:28,035
to bounce inside i guess it's a

1255
00:43:28,035 --> 00:43:29,955
lot like racquetball but with a dodgeball

1256
00:43:30,465 --> 00:43:31,395
we know racket

1257
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:33,225
we just play wall ball which is

1258
00:43:33,255 --> 00:43:34,515

1259
00:43:34,515 --> 00:43:36,495
ball you know or tennis ball yeah

and i forget the rules of it

1261
00:43:38,625 --> 00:43:39,885
but there was something where if you

1262
00:43:39,885 --> 00:43:42,375
did a certain thing the penalty was

1263
00:43:42,375 --> 00:43:44,055
you had to lean against the wall

1264
00:43:44,055 --> 00:43:45,405
with your ass sticking out and then

1265
00:43:45,945 --> 00:43:47,415

00:54:58,090 --> 00:54:59,710
you yeah does and i feel like

00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:02,170
that way when i need a dog

1583
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:03,970
i kind of like that's okay and

1584
00:55:03,970 --> 00:55:05,320
i don't really care because you have

1585
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:06,670
a dog yeah but even before that

1586
00:55:07,510 --> 00:55:09,850
and i think you have this strong

1587
00:55:10,420 --> 00:55:12,760
connection with dogs yeah and you would

1588
00:55:12,850 --> 00:55:13,750
like what kind of dog would you

1589
00:55:13,750 --> 00:55:15,460
want i mean

1590
00:55:15,580 --> 00:55:19,360
i i i love a dog that

1591
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:21,400
you can actually hug like ah like

1592
00:55:21,430 --> 00:55:22,720
i think a little bit bigger like

1593
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:23,950
if he was standing on his hind

1594
00:55:23,950 --> 00:55:26,200
legs he would tower above you know

1595
00:55:26,260 --> 00:55:28,510
like clifford the big red oh that's

1596
00:55:28,510 --> 00:55:30,370
too big okay oh that's true so

1597
00:55:30,370 --> 00:55:32,800
like many by the way they're underselling

1598
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:34,660
how big he is he's bigger than

1599
00:55:34,750 --> 00:55:35,620
i mean the red part

1600
00:55:35,620 --> 00:55:37,180
art is bigger than me yeah houses

1601
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:39,490
you should be clever the gigantic doll

1602
00:55:39,490 --> 00:55:41,890
yeah but reward who even cares if

1603
00:55:41,890 --> 00:55:43,990
he's read i think be he's normally

1604
00:55:44,020 --> 00:55:46,540
it's clifford park with god zilla the

1605
00:55:46,540 --> 00:55:48,490
big yeah yeah yeah the red part

1606
00:55:48,490 --> 00:55:49,660
to me is the strange part i

1607
00:55:49,660 --> 00:55:52,180
love huskies i think they're so funny

1608
00:55:52,330 --> 00:55:54,070
oh but they do require there a

1609
00:55:54,070 --> 00:55:55,480
lot of work you might have

1610
00:55:55,780 --> 00:55:58,000
merlion growing up oh yeah and i

1611
00:55:58,060 --> 00:55:59,560
kind of love that and i think

1612
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:01,300
that'd be really fun they're so pretty

1613
00:56:01,300 --> 00:56:02,350
and big and yeah i think they're

1614
00:56:02,350 --> 00:56:05,950
hypoallergenic too oh yeah i think i

1615
00:56:05,950 --> 00:56:08,140
might be wrong but obviously you know

1616
00:56:08,170 --> 00:56:09,190
you go to the pound and you

1617
00:56:09,190 --> 00:56:11,050
get you get you get you don't

1618
00:56:11,290 --> 00:56:13,420
die rescue a dog you'll like yeah

1619
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:15,160
i love those stories people have of

1620
00:56:15,190 --> 00:56:15,940
of going into

1621
00:56:15,970 --> 00:56:18,580
to rescue place and they look at

1622
00:56:18,580 --> 00:56:19,420
the dogs and then they have a

1623
00:56:19,420 --> 00:56:22,183
connection yeah the connection to smell that's

1624
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:23,740

you go into a rescue place they

1627
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:29,710
should force you to because it's like

1628
00:56:29,710 --> 00:56:30,790
basically you just pay them and they

1629
00:56:30,792 --> 00:56:32,530
give you the dog they should force

1630
00:56:32,530 --> 00:56:34,300
you to do the rescue whatever they

1645
00:57:00,130 --> 00:57:01,960
a business transact so you can literally

1646
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:03,460
say and it can be fake and

1647
00:57:03,460 --> 00:57:05,620
the guns aren't real they're they're firing

1648
00:57:05,650 --> 00:57:07,150
away so i'm gonna throw something out

1649
00:57:07,150 --> 00:57:08,350
there though i think that there should

1650
00:57:08,350 --> 00:57:09,160
be it should be sort of a

1651
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:11,680
fifty fifty chance that the dog has

1652
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:13,540
to rescue you yeah well when it

1653
00:57:13,540 --> 00:57:15,520
said who rescued who i was just

1654
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:16,420
thinking that because

1655
00:57:16,420 --> 00:57:18,670
oz ensconced scenarios like oh no i

1656
00:57:18,670 --> 00:57:20,260
rescued this dog right it's very clearly

1657
00:57:20,290 --> 00:57:22,000
didn't do shit yeah so maybe maybe

1658
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,620
there's an you flip a coin to

1659
00:57:23,620 --> 00:57:26,410
see a dog which scenario doge doge

1660
00:57:26,410 --> 00:57:27,910
coin yeah but to see to see

1661
00:57:27,910 --> 00:57:29,590
who goes first but you're in a

1662
00:57:29,590 --> 00:57:31,240
cage at one point in the dog

1663
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:32,770
like goes up to the cage and

1664
00:57:32,770 --> 00:57:33,700
tries to figure out how to get

1665
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:35,380
you out yeah yeah hey guess what

1666
00:57:35,380 --> 00:57:36,580
no opposable thumbs not go

1667
00:57:36,610 --> 00:57:38,500
to happen and then they're stuck in

1668
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:39,850
a cage forever then you're stuck in

1669
00:57:39,850 --> 00:57:41,140
the cage forever yeah okay at the

1670
00:57:41,140 --> 00:57:44,320
very least you should after after you

1671
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:45,460
select the dog you feel like you've

1672
00:57:45,460 --> 00:57:47,710
made that connection yeah you should then

1673
00:57:47,710 --> 00:57:50,140
treat places yeah and see does the

1674
00:57:50,140 --> 00:57:51,640
dog now feel the same and now

1675
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:53,080
that they're outside of the cage and

1676
00:57:53,080 --> 00:57:54,280

why one for a million hours a

1746
01:00:06,160 --> 01:00:07,780
day means so much exercise my dad

1747
01:00:07,780 --> 01:00:09,280
would take it on like long runs

1748
01:00:09,310 --> 01:00:11,890
yeah and um but yeah it was

1749
01:00:11,890 --> 01:00:13,540
really wild and it was big

1750
01:00:13,540 --> 01:00:14,830
yg in our house our houses like

1751
01:00:14,980 --> 01:00:16,300
tight and it was like its tail

1752
01:00:16,300 --> 01:00:17,798
with flap and knock everything where it's

1753
01:00:17,798 --> 01:00:19,240
just like ah it just was yeah

1754
01:00:19,270 --> 01:00:22,150
crazy idea um so we can eat

1755
01:00:22,270 --> 01:00:24,130
so it actually was i've probably told

1756
01:00:24,130 --> 01:00:26,320
the story it was given to my

1757
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:28,120
dad's friend who had a farm and

1758
01:00:28,120 --> 01:00:29,410
it went to a farm so that

1759
01:00:29,410 --> 01:00:32,522
is oh can't happen huh i know

1760
01:00:32,522 --> 01:00:33,637
i asked as an adult though

1761
01:00:33,700 --> 01:00:37,540
is that really true that ah so

1762
01:00:37,540 --> 01:00:38,828
they still don't trust you with the

1763
01:00:38,861 --> 01:00:42,220
real answer yeah they they put him

1764
01:00:42,220 --> 01:00:44,230
down they instantly put him down our

1765
01:00:44,230 --> 01:00:45,820
houses big enough for a big dog

1766
01:00:45,970 --> 01:00:47,443
we'd have to get like probably a

1767
01:00:47,860 --> 01:00:49,630
midsize associate

1768
01:00:51,375 --> 01:00:54,375
