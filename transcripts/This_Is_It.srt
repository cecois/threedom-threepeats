out by the way speaking of names

and our and we were talking about

28
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:18,960
our parents on the last episode and

we're not talking about him they'll come

30
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:23,730
up again my brother whose name well

31
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:24,900
first of all his first name is

32
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:25,890
burt after my

33
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:28,800
father but he went by greg i

34
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:31,770
don't blame him what parts better really

35
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:33,540
you do think not back in the

36
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:35,940
bag of analogy now it's probably better

37
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:39,780
but um but he my dad fucked

38
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:42,420
up the name think it's a name

39
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:45,900
like my mom and dad had agreed

40
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:46,080
on

41
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:47,340
what the name was going to be

42
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:49,620
and then ah and it's not even

43
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:52,140
close to greg whan it was they

44
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:53,520
just like it was like some italy

45
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:55,710
or something and then they and then

46
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:58,170
they asked my dad what's his name

47
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:00,600
for the for the birth certificate anyway

48
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:03,030
greg this is out of left field

49
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:04,740

51
00:02:06,308 --> 00:02:08,100

with we got one yesterday from you

131
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:35,760
about the lie

132
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,470
live action lilo and stitch that's a

133
00:04:37,475 --> 00:04:42,330
movie like the point people yeah and

134
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:43,470
there's a picture there was a picture

135
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:45,270
floating around the internet of what of

136
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:47,730
the terrifying inch that is stanched yes

137
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:50,130
and a little caroline where real real

138
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:52,170
life yeah yes yeah that's why it

139
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:54,420
was a cartoon very cute mccarthy we

140
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:55,890
remake everything

141
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:57,930
oh now we're getting to the deep

142
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:01,650
philosophical stuff finally oh what i love

143
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:03,630
a good remake but we don't need

144
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:05,430
it for every single thing that's ever

145
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,680
been that's true but that disney seems

146
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,180
to be on that trajectory where they're

147
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:10,230
saying we're going to take all the

148
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:12,420
movies we've already made in cartoon form

149
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:14,100
and make them live validation makes it

150
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,300
all like if it's in two d

151
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:15,870
animation

152
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,030
i guess i like it if it's

153
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:19,800
two d they should upgraded to two

154
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:22,050
three d animation and then go live

155
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:23,700
action they're skipping a step if it's

156
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,410
three d they should make it forty

157
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:27,420
no but live action is that like

158
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:28,710
they're not like the one they said

159
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:30,330
a live action lion king banking was

160
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,370
one every single thing there would be

161
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,800
some actual humans in it right now

162
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,150
there should be there should be like

163
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,860
charlie chaplin the little tramp should just

164
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:39,750
come in suddenly yeah why not because

165
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:41,490
it looks beautiful but it is shot

166
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:43,470
for shot exactly what the original lion

167
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:45,450
king and it's just three d animation

168
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:47,010
yeah and then i heard something about

169
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:48,360
how like the original animators don't get

170
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,500
any sort of money for that even

171
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,490
though they came up with all of

172
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:54,090
those images well the now we're talking

173
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:56,400
about the long history of exploitation

174
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,500

188
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:26,310
i think that what my name should

189
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:27,930
be like if you saw a picture

190
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:29,400
of oh my god this is amazing

191
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:31,983
sure of me yeah with the way

192
00:06:31,983 --> 00:06:34,140
i like all dressed up yeah mustache

193
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:37,110
the whole deal my name should be

194
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:43,410
dennis j peacock okay so you're basically

195
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:46,589
like a clue character yeah yeah aren't

196
00:06:46,589 --> 00:06:48,390
i yeah yeah you are sort of

197
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:50,670
okay that's a fun game though but

198
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:51,570
yeah anyone can you only do it

199
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:54,090
about yourself i think you can only

200
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,200
do it about yeah because it's like

201
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:57,626
potentially offensive yes so i want to

202
00:06:57,626 --> 00:06:58,230
do it for you

203
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:00,540
no of course you do but scratch

204
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:05,580

like my noise

206
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:10,320
like my name should be like like

207
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:13,620
something like a little bit quirkier you

208
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:14,991
think because you have a i think

209
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,437
i just goofy i feel like it's

210
00:07:16,437 --> 00:07:18,060
like so i could easily be like

211
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:20,370
danny or some i think lauren lucas

212
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:22,050
first of all the alliteration i like

213
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:24,060
the alliteration i like the things six

214
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,800
yeah six letters and each one would

215
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,420
you say six six six and six

216
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:27,660

six for the devil my favorite guy

218
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:31,380

220
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:36,240

00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:03,060
going to be lap cats yeah that

234
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:04,440

dorothea liguria daddy lie so she's talking

238
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,790
about drugstore when you're supposed to be

239
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:13,350
in class at one point i considered

240
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:15,690
just being lorne allegro as my last

241
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:18,150
name and seems to f know to

242
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:20,220
me it's too like pretty like it's

243
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:22,950
too like yeah i like what it

244
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:24,390

245
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:25,320
fucking know well but

246
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,310
it's like a big thing when you

247
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:28,530
think about like naming a person as

248
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:30,660
a huge to you and then that

249
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:33,150

i didn't like it yeah exactly i

251
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,390
think you have to as an exercise

252
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:37,770
think you have to look at a

253
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:40,170
picture of yourself where you feel like

254
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,900
the naked this picture where you feel

255
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:44,250
naked but you have to be making

256
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:45,600
when you're looking at the picture you

257
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,580
you must be new it should be

258
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:50,010
next with the body mass index yeah

259
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:53,910
that's right and police shot people who

260
00:08:53,926 --> 00:08:56,880
look like you enough to where exactly

261
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,560
yeah actually have you heard about this

262
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,080
show um no game of clones on

263
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,690
mtv i just heard oh tv it's

264
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,760
thrones i think when each new absolut

265
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,620
not it's an mtv dating show where

266
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:09,030
the person has a type and then

267
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:10,260
they bring the people who are going

268
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:12,360
to compete for them are all identical

269
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,280
like it's like six men who don't

270
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,450
know each other who will happen to

271
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:17,070
have the exact same style and look

272
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:18,810

282
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:34,860

00:10:47,785 --> 00:10:49,765
do whatever they wanna do that's the

324
00:10:49,765 --> 00:10:51,445
thing where here's for such a out

325

leaf candle we're here for such a

326
00:10:52,855 --> 00:10:54,265
short time if someone wants to you

327
00:10:54,268 --> 00:10:55,885

episode about photos and we shouldn't be

00:10:57,535 --> 00:10:59,395
looking at photos and i i've been

330
00:10:59,395 --> 00:11:00,985
thinking that too well part of the

331
00:11:00,985 --> 00:11:02,785
problem with doing shows like this is

332
00:11:02,785 --> 00:11:04,015
like we have to take photos for

333
00:11:04,015 --> 00:11:05,815
the show yeah and we have to

334
00:11:05,815 --> 00:11:07,525
put them out and i know every

335
00:11:07,525 --> 00:11:08,995
single time i put out a photo

336
00:11:08,995 --> 00:11:11,275
for a show anytime i put out

337
00:11:11,275 --> 00:11:11,665
a show

338
00:11:11,695 --> 00:11:12,505
it's going to be a test to

339
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:14,185
a photo and i'm grey yet cracks

340
00:11:14,185 --> 00:11:16,165
about my looks so it's like it

341
00:11:16,165 --> 00:11:17,155
makes me go oh i don't want

342
00:11:17,155 --> 00:11:19,915
to do shows anymore but like is

343
00:11:19,915 --> 00:11:21,325
there a way to post something that

344
00:11:21,325 --> 00:11:24,265
it's not that like what could you

345
00:11:24,265 --> 00:11:25,615
post like is there a way to

346
00:11:25,615 --> 00:11:27,295
post where it's just the guests there

347
00:11:27,295 --> 00:11:28,915
should be oh i'm sure there is

348
00:11:28,915 --> 00:11:31,825
sketch artist draws you really nicely

349
00:11:31,825 --> 00:11:34,075
the the way that was the of

350
00:11:34,096 --> 00:11:35,185
voice do the job what if that

351
00:11:35,185 --> 00:11:36,715
was part of what kevin did does

352
00:11:36,715 --> 00:11:38,545
here which by the way i don't

353
00:11:38,545 --> 00:11:40,285
know the other parts but it just

354
00:11:40,285 --> 00:11:42,025
works we just don't have to leave

355
00:11:42,025 --> 00:11:43,975
at one because this is where one

356
00:11:43,975 --> 00:11:44,965
part of it where he had to

357
00:11:44,965 --> 00:11:46,315
sketch us while we did the show

358
00:11:46,645 --> 00:11:48,505
that would be something kevin there's a

359
00:11:48,505 --> 00:11:50,575
question why do they do courtroom sketches

360
00:11:50,605 --> 00:11:51,655
like how long does it take

361
00:11:51,985 --> 00:11:53,305
yeah that's the other thing let them

362
00:11:53,305 --> 00:11:55,045
take photos why are they sitting there

363
00:11:55,045 --> 00:11:56,785
sketching with like colors and stuff like

364
00:11:56,785 --> 00:11:58,735
yeah get to the point where we've

365
00:11:58,735 --> 00:12:00,595
just accepted a world where you're not

366
00:12:00,595 --> 00:12:02,065
allowed to take photos in a courtroom

367
00:12:02,065 --> 00:12:03,775
and people sit there with colored pencils

368
00:12:03,805 --> 00:12:05,605
i guess it's less distracting than camera

369
00:12:05,935 --> 00:12:08,275

392
00:12:47,275 --> 00:12:48,115
i feel like if i were in

393
00:12:48,115 --> 00:12:49,795
a court case and i was crying

394
00:12:49,945 --> 00:12:51,595
and someone was sketching me like i

395
00:12:51,755 --> 00:12:52,345
need them to stop

396
00:12:52,585 --> 00:12:54,445

397
00:12:54,445 --> 00:12:57,055
you drawing that's lauren i've never heard

00:12:57,055 --> 00:12:58,675
that i've never expressed it out loud

399
00:12:58,675 --> 00:13:00,145
that's true i mean sounds like a

400
00:13:00,145 --> 00:13:01,945
feeling of like someone like

401
00:13:03,055 --> 00:13:04,735
putting their their hands on yours maybe

402
00:13:04,735 --> 00:13:07,015
you are a drawing come to life

403
00:13:07,345 --> 00:13:08,995
that means a lot of sense actually

404
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:11,059
because you do look to look like

405
00:13:11,065 --> 00:13:13,075
something like a disney animator with you

406
00:13:13,075 --> 00:13:15,537
on my machine my character psychologists that

407
00:13:15,537 --> 00:13:17,395
i was like a disney princess slowdown

408
00:13:17,725 --> 00:13:20,365
from the pusher are you from cool

hundred and ninety three brad pitt i

412
00:13:27,779 --> 00:13:29,905
guess someone here david bowie in the

413
00:13:29,905 --> 00:13:31,435
theme so i didn't think you'd not

414
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:32,875
weird someone else out there relates to

415
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:35,275
this feeling and there's a diagnosis maybe

416
00:13:35,275 --> 00:13:36,415
they do maybe it's my niece

417
00:13:38,635 --> 00:13:39,025
my bike

418
00:13:40,345 --> 00:13:41,665
it might be a thing where if

419
00:13:41,665 --> 00:13:43,315
you know someone's drawing you it makes

420
00:13:43,315 --> 00:13:45,445
you like self conscious or something yeah

believed to which i think is really

470
00:15:18,055 --> 00:15:19,465
weird like i have a friend doesn't

471
00:15:19,465 --> 00:15:20,755
like to wear that that's the thing

472
00:15:20,755 --> 00:15:23,035
about dresses it's weird that it's clothing

473
00:15:23,035 --> 00:15:24,865
where it's like open right where the

474
00:15:25,135 --> 00:15:27,175
the pussy you know that's not the

475
00:15:27,205 --> 00:15:29,485
reason why it's weird okay you know

476
00:15:29,487 --> 00:15:31,105
like guys don't have that so like

477
00:15:31,105 --> 00:15:32,665
it has a hole in the front

478
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:34,495
my guys are covering their buddies can

479
00:15:34,495 --> 00:15:36,265
wear well and the wrong dog thinks

480
00:15:36,265 --> 00:15:37,345
the ground but still

481
00:15:37,345 --> 00:15:38,725
l and but it should have a

482
00:15:38,725 --> 00:15:41,305
close it should be closed down chopper

483
00:15:41,305 --> 00:15:44,452
born address yeah it's various things and

484
00:15:44,452 --> 00:15:46,735
it's like gets comfortable bringing it's kinda

485
00:15:46,735 --> 00:15:48,265
cool but you should just wear shorts

486
00:15:48,325 --> 00:15:50,845
anyway i worry we should wear shorts

487
00:15:50,935 --> 00:15:52,915
why do you want to wear shorts

488
00:15:52,945 --> 00:15:55,375
i'm saying it's weird that they're short

489
00:15:55,645 --> 00:15:57,175
right area here's the problem

490
00:15:57,505 --> 00:15:59,305
is that women are not wearing shorts

491
00:15:59,305 --> 00:16:01,405
enough and they should wear georgeson scores

492
00:16:01,444 --> 00:16:03,235
and that's an hockey jersey here's a

493
00:16:03,235 --> 00:16:05,215

00:17:48,475 --> 00:17:51,025
silhouettes um and it took him like

554
00:17:51,265 --> 00:17:53,185
a minute it was like very cool

555
00:17:53,245 --> 00:17:54,295
really stand in front of light and

556
00:17:54,295 --> 00:17:55,345
he was like dude you're cutting it

557
00:17:55,345 --> 00:17:57,715
freehand yeah wow like what looks more

558
00:17:57,715 --> 00:17:58,405
like him than

559
00:17:58,525 --> 00:17:59,785
i look like me but it's still

560
00:17:59,785 --> 00:18:01,285
really cool we had that done at

561
00:18:01,285 --> 00:18:03,325
a wedding they had a silhouette just

562
00:18:03,805 --> 00:18:05,755
at a wedding ah that jane and

563
00:18:05,755 --> 00:18:08,485
i went to and i was very

564
00:18:08,515 --> 00:18:10,315
trepidation about doing it yeah it was

565
00:18:10,315 --> 00:18:11,815
like if there's anything i hate it's

566
00:18:11,815 --> 00:18:14,155
my profile i feel like i've one

567
00:18:14,155 --> 00:18:15,595
good angle and i'm not thrilled about

568
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:17,155
that which one is your good ones

569
00:18:17,605 --> 00:18:17,875
right

570
00:18:18,655 --> 00:18:20,605
right down the road i feel much

571
00:18:20,605 --> 00:18:22,015
better about my straight oh yes well

572
00:18:22,525 --> 00:18:26,603
but this characteristic was very forgiving really

573
00:18:26,603 --> 00:18:28,555
and she forgives you she forgive me

574
00:18:28,765 --> 00:18:30,565
can you again we have we haven't

575
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:31,465
we framed it we have it on

576
00:18:31,465 --> 00:18:33,205
display in our home but i was

577
00:18:33,475 --> 00:18:37,135
astonished watching her do it because she

578
00:18:37,135 --> 00:18:38,785
wasn't like the the

579
00:18:39,505 --> 00:18:41,335
she didn't have the people against like

580
00:18:41,335 --> 00:18:43,045
a screen or something to see the

581
00:18:43,075 --> 00:18:44,875
shadows she just i'm doing it france

582
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:47,365
she just oh wow so it was

583
00:18:47,365 --> 00:18:49,135
wild it was wide and it looks

584
00:18:49,135 --> 00:18:51,175
like you yeah wow it looks i

585
00:18:51,175 --> 00:18:53,605
mean yeah now looks enough like yeah

586
00:18:53,605 --> 00:18:55,220
crazy if you walk if you order

587
00:18:55,226 --> 00:18:56,995
out you know that's them people who

588
00:18:56,995 --> 00:18:58,525
can do that i mean i took

589
00:18:58,525 --> 00:18:58,945
our class

590
00:18:58,945 --> 00:19:01,075
this is as a kid because i

591
00:19:01,075 --> 00:19:02,125
wanted to be a cartoonist when i

592
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:04,675
grew up but and so i learned

593
00:19:04,675 --> 00:19:06,505
various things about like you know make

594
00:19:06,505 --> 00:19:08,425
everyone a shape or you know we

595
00:19:08,425 --> 00:19:10,945
did the whole like turn draw something

596
00:19:10,945 --> 00:19:14,845
upside down that will remove your perception

597
00:19:14,845 --> 00:19:16,255
of it does that make sense like

598
00:19:16,495 --> 00:19:19,045
if you see a horse you

599
00:19:19,105 --> 00:19:20,395
have a perception of it as a

600
00:19:20,395 --> 00:19:21,625
horse so you're trying to draw it

601
00:19:21,625 --> 00:19:23,095
as a horse whatever your perception is

602
00:19:23,095 --> 00:19:24,655
whereas if you like turn a picture

603
00:19:24,655 --> 00:19:26,275
upside down and just draw it as

604
00:19:26,275 --> 00:19:27,865
the shape it comes out more accurately

605
00:19:28,225 --> 00:19:29,605
yeah it was if you see a

606
00:19:29,665 --> 00:19:31,825
horse you take him down right away

607
00:19:31,945 --> 00:19:34,705
yeah so you establish dominance over the

608
00:19:34,705 --> 00:19:36,265
arms it's over you get on top

609
00:19:36,265 --> 00:19:37,525
and it's upside down right

610
00:19:38,185 --> 00:19:39,925
but and then nature takes it's course

611
00:19:39,955 --> 00:19:40,975
and with that i'll see what i

612
00:19:40,975 --> 00:19:42,625
was doing but that skill of just

613
00:19:42,625 --> 00:19:43,585
being able to like how did you

614
00:19:43,585 --> 00:19:44,845
figure out you're good at that did

615
00:19:44,845 --> 00:19:46,222
someone turn to the side once and

616
00:19:46,222 --> 00:19:47,185
you go i know how to do

617
00:19:47,185 --> 00:19:49,825
that it feels old timey yeah maybe

618
00:19:49,825 --> 00:19:51,265
they like resizing land or something like

619
00:19:51,295 --> 00:19:53,545
oh gee artist yeah it was yeah

620
00:19:53,545 --> 00:19:55,015
it was like a popular fad of

621
00:19:55,045 --> 00:19:56,905
of a bygone era yeah right yeah

622
00:19:56,935 --> 00:19:58,225
people why would people get so

623
00:19:58,255 --> 00:20:01,495
silhouettes instead of just drawings of themselves

624
00:20:01,495 --> 00:20:02,605
or i guess you could get both

625
00:20:02,695 --> 00:20:04,615
it seems really bigotry i think the

626
00:20:04,615 --> 00:20:06,055
novelty of it yeah it wasn't like

627
00:20:06,055 --> 00:20:08,395
victorian era they had silhouettes and like

628
00:20:08,425 --> 00:20:10,555
their name we had a ton of

629
00:20:10,555 --> 00:20:12,685
your silhouette cameo we had a ton

630
00:20:12,685 --> 00:20:14,245
of silhouettes growing up like my my

631
00:20:14,245 --> 00:20:17,605
parents would buy pieces of art and

632
00:20:17,605 --> 00:20:18,385
then they would all

633
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:21,010
and they would never change yeah yeah

634
00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:22,930
you know they like most people so

635
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:24,670
we adam johnson silhouettes we in fact

636
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:26,350
when we are in tokyo or kyoto

637
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:28,810
actually recently i was looking through a

638
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:31,660
magazine of ah various things to do

639
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:33,310
in kyoto and there was a museum

640
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:35,410
and they had a picture of the

641
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:36,670
famous painting that was there i was

642
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:38,290

a fake well we had a print

647
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:47,620

708
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:58,180
another dream and suddenly i'm in that

709
00:22:58,180 --> 00:22:59,290
house i'm like oh this is the

710
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:00,550
house dreaming oh that's going to be

711
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:02,020
like the the house you buy some

712
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:03,085
day and you know it's well it's

713
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:03,640
crazy

714
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:04,810
house i don't want to buy it

715
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:08,020
sorry it's like three weird levels it's

716
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:09,490
way too big and how long have

717
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:10,840
you dreamed of this years and years

718
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,370
and years and years and i've never

719
00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:13,450
been to it so why it was

720
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:14,440
so what is it is it a

721
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,780
parallel dimension where i do have this

722
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:19,570
house could be i don't know now

723
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:20,500
that's what i mean don't you think

724
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,990
we exist on multiple planes no okay

725
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:23,800
fuck yes thanks

726
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:24,370
play

727
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:29,050
um i don't know that's the thing

728
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:31,120
is there a multiverse where we've made

729
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,850
different choices and our lives are fucking

730
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:35,350
crazy i think that there might be

731
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:36,880
because like the pain you feel isn't

732
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:37,660
inexplicable

733
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:42,730
meaning when someone draws you out do

734
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:44,140
you mean physical pain or emotional thing

735
00:23:44,264 --> 00:23:45,340
i guess like you know like you

736
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:49,060
could feel like something is bigger than

737
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:50,230
you and i don't know i guess

738
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:51,760
i feel like that could be another

739
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:53,140
version of yourself do you think

740
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:56,110
or is it just that your so's

741
00:23:56,170 --> 00:23:58,240
ah like you love yourself so much

742
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,800
that you think there must be endless

743
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:02,830
multy numbers to me everyone right i

744
00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:05,350
i don't i i feel like i

745
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:07,090
was at ah a gathered recently where

746
00:24:07,090 --> 00:24:08,710
people are talking about you know are

747
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:11,590
we in a simulation and i never

748
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:14,260
heard anybody talk about it

749
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,990
so sincerely as i did at this

750
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:18,550
i have i recently heard somebody talking

751
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:19,754
about this too and they're like yeah

752
00:24:19,754 --> 00:24:21,700
i'm deaf i definitely believe that and

753
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:23,770
when i heard when i heard the

754
00:24:23,770 --> 00:24:26,320
way they were saying it i realized

755
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:27,940
oh i don't at all i think

756
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:29,650
that this is just it and i

757
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,210
think that you know the thing

758
00:24:33,374 --> 00:24:36,610
no sir where are you oh it's

759
00:24:36,610 --> 00:24:38,050
easy somebody made a playlist of every

760
00:24:38,050 --> 00:24:39,790
song we've ever mentioned on the show

761
00:24:40,330 --> 00:24:42,460
it's great it's exhaustive if so an

762
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:44,950
exhausting yeah like us i think that

763
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:48,130
because because there's so much in life

764
00:24:48,130 --> 00:24:51,370
that is random or unfair or inexplicable

765
00:24:51,370 --> 00:24:52,360
or whatever we're always

766
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:53,603
trying to make sense of it yeah

767
00:24:53,603 --> 00:24:55,960
and to me like somebody saying oh

768
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:58,510
this is a simulation sounded no different

769
00:24:58,510 --> 00:24:59,920
to me then oh gosh there's control

770
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:01,540
talking about religion so in control of

771
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:03,700
it it's not pointless yeah anyway the

772
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:05,950
semi that we're in a simulation but

773
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:08,680
but i'm thinking like the multiple dimensions

774
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:11,920
is possible because that's like something that

775
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:12,451
people are

776
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,740
working to prove isn't that awesome yeah

777
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:16,240
i mean i'll say this i think

778
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,910
it's it's possible i don't i don't

779
00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:20,290
think it's probable but i think it's

780
00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:22,330
paul do you think it's not that

781
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:24,520
we're all existing with many different sliding

782
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,650
doors versions of ourselves but that when

783
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:27,760
you die you can go to another

784
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:31,690
dimension yeah know where you're in a

785
00:25:31,690 --> 00:25:32,680
black hole and you don't even have

786
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:34,900
of existence but you're there well people

787
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,235
think i mean i know we've tapped

788
00:25:36,261 --> 00:25:38,770
aspect i would buy your consciousness goes

789
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:41,050
somewhere i don't know we are kind

790
00:25:41,050 --> 00:25:42,190
of dipping our toe but do you

791
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:43,660
think do you think there's ever been

792
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:45,790
someone who suddenly like they're acting way

793
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:47,800
different than they've like a good friend

794
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,330
or something and you're like they change

795
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:51,340
maybe it's like someone from their multi

796
00:25:51,370 --> 00:25:52,840
the multiverse like took their play

797
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:56,740
case you know i don't buy that

798
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:58,240
you don't buy you don't think that

799
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,710
we able to access you don't think

800
00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:01,120
we're able to so i don't think

801
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,950
anyone's coming into this one from you

802
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:04,690
or one zinc there's never been a

803
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:07,120
traveler from another divine there's been one

804
00:26:08,316 --> 00:26:11,440
got bacula it's cut badly there's a

805
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:15,640
scott eric go yeah found it or

806
00:26:15,649 --> 00:26:17,980
at least expected another dementia

807
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:21,100
yeah i don't know but ah do

808
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:23,080

816
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:38,740

i have lately i've had a few

818
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:44,590
anxiety ish dreams really but they're like

819
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:46,810
so low level it's it's more annoying

820
00:26:46,810 --> 00:26:48,520
than anything like why did i dream

821
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,140
about being anxious about that dumb thing

822
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,790
right but being late for something or

823
00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:53,440
whatever but i used to have a

824
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,760
for the longest time i would have

825
00:26:55,034 --> 00:27:00,472
longest time ah dreams

826
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:06,206
death longest time you imagine if it

827
00:27:06,206 --> 00:27:08,470
isn't just life you are trying to

828
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:10,420
get through a sentence with and someone

829
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:12,370
did with people it is like this

830
00:27:12,370 --> 00:27:14,590

dr because i always you have the

849
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:54,490
freedom working people they were very yeah

the dreams right it was fucking great

853
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:03,340
so i wake up and it was

854
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:04,990
like i was just in a movie

855
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:06,610

856
00:28:06,610 --> 00:28:07,240
your dream well

857
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:09,130
that's okay you're true here's what i

858
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:10,930
found oh yeah here's what i found

859
00:28:10,930 --> 00:28:14,410
is that when i'm dreaming i usually

860
00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:16,390
have like an escape hatch for whatever

861
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:19,870
situation i'm in and anytime i've you

862
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:21,670
know how it's like you're like dreams

863
00:28:21,670 --> 00:28:23,050
are sort of like improv were like

864
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:26,950
well if this then what so if

865
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:27,400
i'm ever

866
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,990
or in a situation where my brain

867
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:30,250
has gotten me into a thing where

868
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:31,810
i'm like i'm falling out of a

869
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:33,430
plane or whatever like too great a

870
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:35,650
height and i go oh shit there's

871
00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:38,440
no side hatch for this i'm definitely

872
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:40,600
dead that's when i wake up right

873
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:41,920
you know where i go and it

874
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,420
just frightens me too much i'm like

875
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:46,480
oh no i'm no escape hatches here

876
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,530
there's no plan b here

877
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,360
i'm dead i've had that for sure

878
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:51,340
yeah but i've also had dreams where

879
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:53,410
i've died and i mean when you're

880
00:28:53,410 --> 00:28:54,640
just then you're dead like i'm a

881
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,350
different person can we just say kevin's

882
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:57,880
silently leaving cause he has to go

883

and he just left this you have

884
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:01,870

stressful but i've agreed to it and

929
00:30:41,635 --> 00:30:44,605
the date is counting down and suddenly

930
00:30:44,605 --> 00:30:46,015

00:31:02,965 --> 00:31:04,015
where it's like i want to do

941
00:31:04,015 --> 00:31:06,115

942
00:31:06,145 --> 00:31:08,425
yeah i've had dreams and it's infuriating

943
00:31:09,115 --> 00:31:11,605
where the the the anxiety that the

944
00:31:11,605 --> 00:31:14,035
way i'm communicating anxiety to myself is

945
00:31:14,515 --> 00:31:17,785
i'll be in the fucking supermarket trying

946
00:31:17,785 --> 00:31:18,445
to find something

947
00:31:18,445 --> 00:31:20,425
in that i can't find so you're

948
00:31:20,425 --> 00:31:22,915
lost in the supermarket know you're needing

949
00:31:22,921 --> 00:31:24,085
an irony or new guys

950
00:31:25,645 --> 00:31:27,325

these like i'm on stage and i

959
00:31:43,015 --> 00:31:44,725
don't know any my lines why can't

960
00:31:44,725 --> 00:31:45,685
i have a dream where i know

961
00:31:45,685 --> 00:31:47,095

and it's like a wake up and

968
00:31:55,465 --> 00:31:57,175

and dream show like this layer shit

970
00:31:58,668 --> 00:32:00,445

971
00:32:00,445 --> 00:32:02,275
stuff like my dreams and i would

972
00:32:02,275 --> 00:32:03,565
say ten percent of the time they

973
00:32:03,565 --> 00:32:05,455
make sense if you remember i also

974
00:32:05,665 --> 00:32:07,945
like some that are really funny or

975
00:32:08,065 --> 00:32:09,925
it's like it feels amazing like he

976
00:32:09,925 --> 00:32:11,125
wrote his main you're dreaming you're like

977
00:32:11,275 --> 00:32:12,355
wake up you're like right danny like

978
00:32:12,415 --> 00:32:14,185
that actually is good like that makes

979
00:32:14,185 --> 00:32:16,345
sense i actually crazy because most of

980
00:32:16,345 --> 00:32:17,995
the time it's like yeah me going

981
00:32:17,995 --> 00:32:20,965
like oh i do do a lot

982
00:32:20,965 --> 00:32:23,395
of like when you're writing you sort

983
00:32:23,395 --> 00:32:26,035
of work out problems in the writing

984
00:32:26,065 --> 00:32:27,415
through your dream that you can do

985
00:32:27,415 --> 00:32:29,305
that ally were like you're thinking as

986
00:32:29,305 --> 00:32:30,655
you're going to bed you're thinking about

987
00:32:30,655 --> 00:32:31,405
a story prog

988
00:32:31,405 --> 00:32:33,865
elam you're having and then it reveals

989
00:32:33,865 --> 00:32:35,665
itself to you in the dream of

990
00:32:35,665 --> 00:32:36,925
the solution so it's almost like you're

991
00:32:36,925 --> 00:32:38,755
not wasting time while you're sleeping you

992
00:32:38,755 --> 00:32:40,135
know now that i have that a

993
00:32:40,135 --> 00:32:41,635
lot actually where like you wake up

994
00:32:41,635 --> 00:32:43,255
and go oh my god that thing

995
00:32:43,255 --> 00:32:46,405
that i was dreaming about i figured

996
00:32:46,405 --> 00:32:47,846
it out and so there's so many

997
00:32:47,846 --> 00:32:49,825
now i've figured it out with the

998
00:32:49,825 --> 00:32:51,535
pencil and a pen and then so

999
00:32:51,655 --> 00:32:54,445
but conversely i also have the thing

1000
00:32:54,445 --> 00:32:57,085
where i'm like going through an argument

1001
00:32:57,115 --> 00:32:58,705
with someone in my real life as

1002
00:32:58,705 --> 00:32:59,935
i'm going to bed and trying to

1003
00:32:59,935 --> 00:33:01,315
like you know you know how you

1004
00:33:01,315 --> 00:33:03,325
do that thing oh yeah where you're

1005
00:33:03,325 --> 00:33:05,575
trying to anticipate every single thing they

1006
00:33:05,575 --> 00:33:07,885
say and what you would about that

1007
00:33:08,005 --> 00:33:09,805
what you would say as a rejoinder

1008
00:33:09,805 --> 00:33:11,695
to us to do this god damnit

1009
00:33:11,755 --> 00:33:13,075
to do that all the time yeah

1010
00:33:13,195 --> 00:33:15,415
you have imaginary conversations with people instead

1011
00:33:15,415 --> 00:33:17,125
of just happening in bed yeah yeah

1012
00:33:17,155 --> 00:33:18,775
so just having the real conversation yeah

1013
00:33:19,195 --> 00:33:20,695
you know i feel like what even

1014
00:33:20,755 --> 00:33:22,075
are not having the conversation which is

1015
00:33:22,075 --> 00:33:23,455
like getting just getting over it i

1016
00:33:23,455 --> 00:33:26,065
feel like so like there's some people

1017
00:33:26,065 --> 00:33:27,145
who are really good at just going

1018
00:33:27,145 --> 00:33:29,395
like that doesn't matter i'm not going

1019
00:33:29,395 --> 00:33:30,625
to think about that well if it's

1020
00:33:30,625 --> 00:33:31,885
a work thing

1021
00:33:31,915 --> 00:33:34,015
things on the say that's what that's

1022
00:33:34,015 --> 00:33:35,875
what it's been like for me recently

1023
00:33:35,875 --> 00:33:37,255
where it's like a work thing and

1024
00:33:37,255 --> 00:33:40,435
you're like how having you're thinking about

1025
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:42,565
it because like the the actual conversation

1026
00:33:42,565 --> 00:33:45,115
that you can have is days down

1027
00:33:45,115 --> 00:33:46,585
the line and so you're trying to

1028
00:33:46,585 --> 00:33:49,105
anticipate what to say and then that's

1029
00:33:49,135 --> 00:33:51,535
all you dream about is a stressful

1030
00:33:51,565 --> 00:33:51,955
the menu

1031
00:33:52,045 --> 00:33:53,185
get it just right when you actually

1032
00:33:53,185 --> 00:33:55,075
are in the moment right yeah you

1033
00:33:55,075 --> 00:33:57,145
know but i think like in terms

1034
00:33:57,145 --> 00:33:58,711
of like people where you're thinking about

1035
00:33:58,711 --> 00:34:00,595
something from your past were like you

1036
00:34:00,625 --> 00:34:03,085
you either like i wish i'd said

1037
00:34:03,415 --> 00:34:04,915
or like or if i could see

1038
00:34:04,915 --> 00:34:06,145
that person again i would say this

1039
00:34:06,145 --> 00:34:11,215
thing fuck da da se um but

1040
00:34:11,305 --> 00:34:12,198
then i like

1041
00:34:12,295 --> 00:34:13,855
i often think like well what a

1042
00:34:13,855 --> 00:34:15,025
waste of time that is to be

1043
00:34:15,025 --> 00:34:17,215
like thinking about something like re having

1044
00:34:17,215 --> 00:34:18,865
a fight or thinking about someone who

1045
00:34:18,865 --> 00:34:20,185
i don't see but then thinking like

1046
00:34:20,695 --> 00:34:22,105
okay well if i ever did want

1047
00:34:22,105 --> 00:34:23,395
to confront them about that what would

1048
00:34:23,395 --> 00:34:25,405
i say is people who have wronged

1049
00:34:25,405 --> 00:34:27,115
you or people that you have wronged

1050
00:34:27,295 --> 00:34:28,435
like both like i feel like it's

1051
00:34:28,435 --> 00:34:29,875
just like a mixed bag but whoever

1052
00:34:29,875 --> 00:34:30,955
pops up it's like it could be

1053
00:34:30,955 --> 00:34:32,305
anything but it's like has there

1054
00:34:32,365 --> 00:34:34,885
ever been someone where you think about

1055
00:34:34,885 --> 00:34:36,145
that a lot and go oh wow

1056
00:34:36,145 --> 00:34:37,555
if if i could just talk to

1057
00:34:37,555 --> 00:34:39,445
them again like isn't there someone you

1058
00:34:39,445 --> 00:34:40,465
could just reach out to and go

1059
00:34:40,465 --> 00:34:42,145
totally but then i go one thing

1060
00:34:42,145 --> 00:34:43,735
i was thinking about that is that

1061
00:34:43,735 --> 00:34:45,085
that person might not want to hear

1062
00:34:45,085 --> 00:34:47,275
from you like weather like like even

1063
00:34:47,545 --> 00:34:50,275
a nice up even if the apology

1064
00:34:50,275 --> 00:34:51,715
or just saying like let's forget everything

1065
00:34:51,715 --> 00:34:52,525
that ever happened

1066
00:34:52,612 --> 00:34:54,475
are like what put it all away

1067
00:34:55,165 --> 00:34:57,445
it's like i haven't with certain people

1068
00:34:57,445 --> 00:34:58,885
what's our centers to people don't want

1069
00:34:58,885 --> 00:35:00,235
to hear an apology from someone but

1070
00:35:00,265 --> 00:35:01,465
i'm saying i don't even know that

1071
00:35:01,465 --> 00:35:03,115
my thing is an apology necessarily with

1072
00:35:03,475 --> 00:35:04,945
the specific thing i'm thinking of it's

1073
00:35:04,945 --> 00:35:06,145
a friend from a long time ago

1074
00:35:06,535 --> 00:35:07,735
i don't know that the thing is

1075
00:35:07,735 --> 00:35:11,035
an apology so much as let's let

1076
00:35:11,035 --> 00:35:12,571
bygones be bygones like i don't know

1077
00:35:12,571 --> 00:35:12,685

00:35:12,685 --> 00:35:13,885

1079
00:35:13,885 --> 00:35:14,905
ago i don't even really know what

1080
00:35:14,905 --> 00:35:16,165

00:35:48,745 --> 00:35:49,975
and then we just kind of went

1099
00:35:49,975 --> 00:35:53,005
our separate ways and um yeah

1100
00:35:53,005 --> 00:35:57,205
years later ah reconnecting with them briefly

1101
00:35:57,205 --> 00:36:01,615
over something and saying like essentially like

1102
00:36:01,615 --> 00:36:02,905
saying like hey when i look at

1103
00:36:02,935 --> 00:36:04,075
when i look back at the past

1104
00:36:04,435 --> 00:36:06,145
i don't remember any of the bad

1105
00:36:06,145 --> 00:36:07,555
stuff i just remember that we had

1106
00:36:07,555 --> 00:36:09,295
a lot of fun together and the

1107
00:36:09,325 --> 00:36:11,035
person saying yes same here and it's

1108
00:36:11,035 --> 00:36:13,165
like it's nice yeah i say sometime

1109
00:36:13,165 --> 00:36:14,815
seems time just takes care of things

1110
00:36:14,845 --> 00:36:17,275
well somebody doesn't much like scars your

1111
00:36:17,275 --> 00:36:19,015
memories you just forget about the bad

1112
00:36:19,015 --> 00:36:20,905
stuff in a way yeah and then

1113
00:36:20,905 --> 00:36:23,275
i wonder those sometimes guard from lightning

1114
00:36:23,395 --> 00:36:24,955
just like scar yes just from the

1115
00:36:24,955 --> 00:36:26,635
live action lines you do you forget

1116
00:36:26,635 --> 00:36:28,165
because he was a bad thing you

1117
00:36:28,165 --> 00:36:30,025
only remember the fun i forgot about

1118
00:36:30,025 --> 00:36:31,435
scarring feel like we're sponsored by the

1119
00:36:31,435 --> 00:36:32,575
lion king somehow

1120
00:36:33,625 --> 00:36:36,265
yeah whoosh but here's the thing what

1121
00:36:36,265 --> 00:36:38,155
i feel is there's no the first

1122
00:36:38,155 --> 00:36:39,565
of all there's no statute of limitations

1123
00:36:39,565 --> 00:36:41,365
on apologies you can write i would

1124
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:44,575
accept that from anyone anytime but also

1125
00:36:44,875 --> 00:36:47,005
when you're the person apologizing what you

1126
00:36:47,035 --> 00:36:49,075
have to what you really have to

1127
00:36:49,075 --> 00:36:50,875
feel in order for it to be

1128
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:53,455
sincere is you you don't even have

1129
00:36:53,485 --> 00:36:54,985
to you came to worry about whether

1130
00:36:54,985 --> 00:36:56,275
it's gonna be accepted or not right

1131
00:36:56,335 --> 00:36:57,655
it's gotta be like you are owed

1132
00:36:57,655 --> 00:37:00,265
this apology whether whether you accepted or

1133
00:37:00,265 --> 00:37:02,485
not for sure you are owed an

1134
00:37:02,485 --> 00:37:03,775
apology and i'm gonna give you an

1135
00:37:03,775 --> 00:37:05,365
apology yeah and then you know the

1136
00:37:05,365 --> 00:37:06,355
rest is up but it's hard when

1137
00:37:06,355 --> 00:37:07,495
you also feel like they owe you

1138
00:37:07,495 --> 00:37:09,805
one too well that's a different story

1139
00:37:09,835 --> 00:37:12,175
yeah yeah actually my new year's resolution

1140
00:37:12,175 --> 00:37:13,645
this year was to apologize more

1141
00:37:14,215 --> 00:37:16,135
it's it's nice really yeah because i

1142
00:37:16,135 --> 00:37:19,495
noticed towards the end of last year

1143
00:37:20,005 --> 00:37:22,315
that if i were to if i

1144
00:37:22,315 --> 00:37:23,815
were to go to my defaults which

1145
00:37:23,815 --> 00:37:25,255
in my family is like you know

1146
00:37:25,255 --> 00:37:28,615
getting defensive and you know saying i

1147
00:37:28,885 --> 00:37:30,655
and if i could move past that

1148
00:37:30,655 --> 00:37:32,515
in a quicker manner and go you

1149
00:37:32,515 --> 00:37:33,565
know what this person is owed an

1150
00:37:33,805 --> 00:37:35,245
gee i'm just going to like instead

1151
00:37:35,245 --> 00:37:36,475
of just ignoring it i'm just going

1152
00:37:36,475 --> 00:37:37,735
to barrel through and give them one

1153
00:37:38,065 --> 00:37:39,652
i found that it just like ah

1154
00:37:39,715 --> 00:37:42,205
made so many situations so much better

1155
00:37:42,265 --> 00:37:43,795
it's a lesson that i learned and

1156
00:37:43,795 --> 00:37:45,925
it's still like you know the it's

1157
00:37:45,925 --> 00:37:47,335
still work to to put it in

1158
00:37:47,335 --> 00:37:49,645
practice a lot of the time but

1159
00:37:49,765 --> 00:37:51,055
it was such a relief when i

1160
00:37:51,055 --> 00:37:52,975
realized oh i don't have to it's

1161
00:37:52,975 --> 00:37:53,635
okay to be wrong

1162
00:37:53,965 --> 00:37:55,705
yeah and my the way from the

1163
00:37:55,705 --> 00:37:57,325
way i was raised to the how

1164
00:37:57,325 --> 00:37:58,825
i lived like the first half of

1165
00:37:58,825 --> 00:38:00,985
my life was like i have to

1166
00:38:00,985 --> 00:38:02,245
figure out how this is not my

1167
00:38:02,245 --> 00:38:04,195
fault and i have that exact make

1168
00:38:04,195 --> 00:38:05,605
it somebody else will because if i

1169
00:38:05,635 --> 00:38:06,655
if it's my fault that means i'm

1170
00:38:06,655 --> 00:38:08,305
bad i feel like my brother and

1171
00:38:08,305 --> 00:38:10,225
i were in a competition all the

1172
00:38:10,225 --> 00:38:12,295
time for who was to blame for

1173
00:38:12,295 --> 00:38:14,125
stuff and we would

1174
00:38:14,155 --> 00:38:17,005
get spanked you know depending on who

1175
00:38:17,005 --> 00:38:18,145
is to blame and so we were

1176
00:38:18,145 --> 00:38:21,175
always like lying about you know what

1177
00:38:21,175 --> 00:38:22,585
we did or we were always trying

1178
00:38:22,585 --> 00:38:24,685
to say like neuro this it originally

1179
00:38:24,685 --> 00:38:26,875
wasn't my fault you know arguments would

1180
00:38:26,875 --> 00:38:28,075
escalate to the point well who did

1181
00:38:28,075 --> 00:38:30,595
the original thing you know yeah and

1182
00:38:30,595 --> 00:38:31,885
so that's how i feel like my

1183
00:38:31,885 --> 00:38:33,325
life sort of is is like well

1184
00:38:33,325 --> 00:38:34,285

1185
00:38:34,285 --> 00:38:35,665
no the situated you to look just

1186
00:38:35,665 --> 00:38:37,375

1187
00:38:37,375 --> 00:38:38,425
where like you can get to where

1188
00:38:38,425 --> 00:38:40,195
you just never apologize to anyone you're

1189
00:38:40,195 --> 00:38:41,545
just like well just deal with it

1190
00:38:41,545 --> 00:38:43,855

1191
00:38:43,855 --> 00:38:46,195
you catch yourself saying when you catch

1192
00:38:46,195 --> 00:38:48,385
