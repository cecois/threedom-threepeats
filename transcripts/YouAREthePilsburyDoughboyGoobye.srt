those would be more popular like the

128
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,780
surprise element but it was very nice

129
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:44,010

you turn your backdoor yeah like

135
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,450
okay so look look look look at

136
00:04:57,450 --> 00:04:58,608
this i'm not going to you you're

137
00:04:58,608 --> 00:05:00,930
all gonna be um i also inadvertently

138
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:03,360
fooled people with an instagram post where

139
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,670
i had um bloody makeup on my

140
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:08,640
face those will get people they really

141
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,290
do and i thought because i was

142
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,960
i was shooting something and in this

143
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,220
one scene i get beat up and

144
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:14,850
i thought this would be

145
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,670
funny it's pretty obvious i read the

146
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:19,515
new romine film right now the makeup

147
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:21,150
is well done but i'm saying yeah

148
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:23,910
my assumption is typically i wouldn't real

149
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:26,610
why would i enjoy posting why blood

150
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:28,440
come yes yes yes so wouldn't you

151
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:31,050
get medical attention yeah like it's just

152
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:33,150
crazy yeah yeah so i had to

153
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:35,040
reassure people all day because

154
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,540
people were texted me saying oh my

155
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:38,580
god are you okay i like to

156
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,200
think that they thought it was after

157
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,970
one of these episodes we just beat

158
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:43,020
the shit out of you why do

159
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:44,640
you like to think i like it

160
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:46,439
why because i have a twisted mind

161
00:05:46,439 --> 00:05:47,820
i like to think that too that

162
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,020
came right from the twisted mind of

163
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:51,210
scott ackerman that's right i borrowed mine

164
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:52,020
from danny devito

165
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:55,020
which was original twisted mind i think

166
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:56,100
he was i can't think of a

167
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,170
twisted mind before john krasinski has gotten

168
00:05:58,170 --> 00:05:59,340
twisted oh i guess he has an

169
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:03,600
imagination now oh yes meditation well movies

170
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,690
from the imagination of john chris oh

171
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:08,070
the way he imagines the same thing

172
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:08,550
over and over

173
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,940
maybe a little boy came from one

174
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:14,910
idea visible friend and even quieter imaginary

175
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:16,470
friend i mean oh oh oh i

176
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:19,800
see a different film franchise i have

177
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,080
to say drop dead fred right that

178
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,370
ties into the premise of the film

179
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:24,360
in the which is probably why they're

180
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,580
saying it they have quite persistent imaginary

181
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:29,280
for oh noise somebody medication i certainly

182
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:29,640
did

183
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:32,640
understand oh no but you were you

184
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,750
were hyping it up to us like

00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,340
it was well you want to call

186
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:37,230
it from the friend everyone will make

187
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:40,080

master chief vs a memoir that's a

217
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:43,860
good question i don't i e autobiography

218
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:46,470
feels very text but memoir feels like

219
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,780
i'd like to write an autobiography biography

220
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:50,520
but i'm not famous you're gonna say

221
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:52,800
biography memoir feels like

222
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:59,033
funny i centered an autobiographical book memoir

223
00:07:59,046 --> 00:08:01,020
feels more like it's my autobiography but

224
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:02,520
i'm taking some creative liberties

225
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:07,140
i feel like memoirs may be not

226
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:09,180
about your entire life like it's not

227
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:11,520

mammals

264
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:38,100
to call the mammals because of memory

265
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,870
or yeah most i think it's just

266
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:42,780
happening to the mammary glands because they

267
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:45,810
are mammals what the opposite of what

268
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:47,640

275
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:02,025

276
00:10:04,785 --> 00:10:07,395
memoir is an historical account or biography

277
00:10:07,395 --> 00:10:10,575

314
00:11:17,115 --> 00:11:19,365
crack you know sure you start with

315
00:11:19,365 --> 00:11:22,725
crack and then opening up the window

316
00:11:22,725 --> 00:11:23,235
even more

317
00:11:23,715 --> 00:11:25,545
pack them in heroin and then you

318
00:11:25,545 --> 00:11:27,405
just see what happens crack it could

319
00:11:27,405 --> 00:11:29,625
be a gateway drug i suppose since

320
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:32,355
you start with why not go higher

321
00:11:32,355 --> 00:11:33,225
and crack yeah

322
00:11:34,335 --> 00:11:36,285
i would just smoke crack socially and

323
00:11:36,285 --> 00:11:37,995
then before i knew it i was

00:13:17,205 --> 00:13:19,965
you do a noise um the prestige

373
00:13:20,085 --> 00:13:20,595
is

374
00:13:20,775 --> 00:13:22,485
ah christian bailey i believe is that

375
00:13:22,485 --> 00:13:24,645
the one with hugh jackman huge jacked

376
00:13:24,645 --> 00:13:27,615
man is in this hugh jackman plays

377
00:13:27,675 --> 00:13:29,115
a role he plays a double role

378
00:13:29,115 --> 00:13:31,215
in this noise really avoid it was

379
00:13:31,425 --> 00:13:33,225
old news that i'm happy for him

380
00:13:33,225 --> 00:13:34,515
but you know what i bet that

381
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:36,435
something i learned felt bad about and

382
00:13:36,435 --> 00:13:38,535
forgot well because he's with his wife

383
00:13:38,535 --> 00:13:40,425
for like ever in a long time

384
00:13:40,425 --> 00:13:40,755
yeah

385
00:13:40,755 --> 00:13:42,345
oh yeah i'm happy for them both

386
00:13:42,345 --> 00:13:43,395
i think sometimes that can be a

387
00:13:43,395 --> 00:13:45,465
great step yeah of course it can

388
00:13:45,465 --> 00:13:45,795
be

389
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:49,395
um to not living with that person

390
00:13:49,426 --> 00:13:51,315
he wants his the news is that

391
00:13:51,315 --> 00:13:53,145
he wants his estranged wife to sign

392
00:13:53,145 --> 00:13:58,425
an n da o e not suspicious

393
00:13:58,425 --> 00:14:04,095
so not amicable um tricky he plays

394
00:14:04,095 --> 00:14:06,945
a double role in the prestige and

395
00:14:07,005 --> 00:14:07,155
the

396
00:14:07,192 --> 00:14:10,605
one character is so entertaining that i

397
00:14:10,605 --> 00:14:12,555
wished that they'd had it he had

398
00:14:12,555 --> 00:14:13,935
it's own he had his own movie

399
00:14:14,415 --> 00:14:15,315
you should do this but you should

400
00:14:15,315 --> 00:14:16,725
write a spin off like a sitcom

401
00:14:18,345 --> 00:14:20,835

website or oh the website i remember

yeah okay so knowledge it was very

498
00:17:38,685 --> 00:17:40,245
popular and they made a tv show

499
00:17:40,245 --> 00:17:42,495
out of it where it was three

500
00:17:42,495 --> 00:17:43,155
judges allah

501
00:17:43,155 --> 00:17:45,645
the american idol and lorenzo lamas discussing

502
00:17:45,645 --> 00:17:47,235
human being was one of them and

503
00:17:47,235 --> 00:17:49,485
he would aim a laser pointer at

504
00:17:49,545 --> 00:17:51,495
women in their bikinis and show parts

505
00:17:51,495 --> 00:17:54,315
of their body problem areas so disgusting

506
00:17:54,315 --> 00:17:55,755
yeah that was a one season or

507
00:17:55,935 --> 00:18:00,105
oh yeah that's sickening yes sickening where

508
00:18:00,165 --> 00:18:02,205
a rare instance of network television saying

509
00:18:02,205 --> 00:18:03,315
womb guess we were wrong about how

510
00:18:03,345 --> 00:18:05,025
discussing everyone let's course correct

511
00:18:06,464 --> 00:18:07,785
yeah i guess they must not everyone

512
00:18:07,785 --> 00:18:09,705
would love that yeah let's just like

513
00:18:09,945 --> 00:18:13,215
nobody is perfect so nobody's gonna like

514
00:18:13,215 --> 00:18:16,964
this nobody's perfect i swear probes neural

515
00:18:16,964 --> 00:18:19,395
ladies nervous that i know what he's

516
00:18:19,455 --> 00:18:22,215
perfect of course sure it does seem

517
00:18:22,215 --> 00:18:23,025
like a lot of

518
00:18:24,255 --> 00:18:25,515
a lot of stuff like this culture

519
00:18:25,515 --> 00:18:27,675
is reaction to the previous decade like

520
00:18:27,675 --> 00:18:29,445
i was thinking about gross-out comedies you

521
00:18:29,445 --> 00:18:30,795
know in the nineties and i was

522
00:18:30,795 --> 00:18:33,525
like why was everything all why we're

523
00:18:34,725 --> 00:18:35,595
here though i did

524
00:18:38,325 --> 00:18:39,525
but you know like why why were

525
00:18:39,525 --> 00:18:42,045
those the most popular comedies and then

526
00:18:42,045 --> 00:18:43,965
you go well it's because in the

527
00:18:43,965 --> 00:18:46,545
eighties everything was so like monoculture was

528
00:18:46,545 --> 00:18:48,735
just so like straight norm and especially

529
00:18:48,735 --> 00:18:50,295
like everything on tv was like home

530
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:52,755
improvement and it's also endless imitations of

531
00:18:52,755 --> 00:18:54,495
the one thing that was successful right

532
00:18:55,395 --> 00:18:56,505
i was just talking on the way

533
00:18:56,505 --> 00:18:56,835
here

534
00:18:56,835 --> 00:18:58,455
ear on the phone to my friend

535
00:18:59,115 --> 00:19:01,965
about three it was hands-free and he

536
00:19:01,965 --> 00:19:04,545
brought up the movie eddie and then

537
00:19:04,545 --> 00:19:05,715
i thought that was the one where

538
00:19:05,715 --> 00:19:07,845
whoopi goldberg had a dinosaur for a

539
00:19:07,845 --> 00:19:09,825
friend and then he looked up in

540
00:19:09,825 --> 00:19:11,355
those theodore rex i was like that

541
00:19:11,355 --> 00:19:12,585
was a period of time where it's

542
00:19:12,585 --> 00:19:14,775
right that could happen yeah when almost

543
00:19:14,775 --> 00:19:16,545
didn't come out or something like that

544
00:19:16,545 --> 00:19:16,995
it was like a

545
00:19:17,025 --> 00:19:18,855
big lawsuit i can't remember touching go

546
00:19:18,855 --> 00:19:19,995
there for a while you don't know

547
00:19:19,995 --> 00:19:21,225
but there were so many things but

548
00:19:21,225 --> 00:19:23,145
we got it at that time were

549
00:19:23,145 --> 00:19:25,695
like an animal or a puppet or

550
00:19:25,695 --> 00:19:27,645
thanks yeah i was forced to be

551
00:19:27,645 --> 00:19:30,255
in it it was originally intended for

552
00:19:30,255 --> 00:19:33,435
theatrical it went direct to video and

553
00:19:33,585 --> 00:19:37,155
consequentially consequently became the most expensive directive

554
00:19:37,155 --> 00:19:39,495
video film ever made monster essential

555
00:19:40,815 --> 00:19:45,435

the other day we had one where

610
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:51,770
i couldn't get it and i believe

611
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:53,690
lauren were you stumped as well um

612
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:55,610
yesterday yeah and

613
00:21:55,850 --> 00:21:58,640
the the thing that really held me

614
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,260
up was and i was very surprised

615
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:04,370
at the reveal was ah measurements of

616
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:07,340
water yeah and so yeah but that

617
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:09,920
was it was like descriptions of type

618
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:13,310
like yeah it was like bead drop

619
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:14,930
something like that glob one of them

620
00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:15,890
was glob

621
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:17,390
i've never heard that in my life

622
00:22:17,407 --> 00:22:19,880
above water i think of glob is

623
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,520
like more viscous like mustard you got

624
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,080
a glob of mustard on my shirt

625
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:27,020
i glob but is mustard considered a

626
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:29,838
liquid not by me i think i've

627
00:22:29,838 --> 00:22:33,140
never drunk it well is mustard considered

628
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:35,450
a liquid maybe with lex wikipedia

629
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:39,440
mustard as a liquid yellow food um

630
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:41,090
i feel like blob is short for

631
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:43,880
globule which means a drop then say

632
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:46,790
globule it's not like a common like

633
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:48,530
people aren't going around saying globule they're

634
00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:50,750
not saying a lobbying job of water

635
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:52,640
on my shirt no one's ever said

636
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,778

637
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:56,300

00:39:18,245 --> 00:39:19,835
yeah i also saw this article that

1123
00:39:19,835 --> 00:39:23,045
was like companies have known forever that

1124
00:39:23,045 --> 00:39:25,145

no no you can't do that you'd

1173
00:40:55,515 --> 00:40:57,098
have to be a continual song because

1174
00:40:57,111 --> 00:40:59,355
the fading out and the silence in

1175
00:40:59,355 --> 00:41:00,945
between and then suddenly a song starts

1176
00:41:00,945 --> 00:41:01,815

1177
00:41:01,815 --> 00:41:03,615

00:43:26,985 --> 00:43:29,355
like a huge ship like an old

1248
00:43:29,355 --> 00:43:31,817

that dinosaurs you know didn't have feathers

1256
00:43:47,115 --> 00:43:48,465

probably it was like pirates as power

1263
00:44:01,395 --> 00:44:03,225

00:44:03,225 --> 00:44:04,725
