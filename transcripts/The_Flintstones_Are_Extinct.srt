313
00:11:57,405 --> 00:11:59,775
up one hundred percent so the show

00:12:04,995 --> 00:12:06,093
the the medium who

317
00:12:06,195 --> 00:12:07,665
was on the show hollywood medium as

318
00:12:07,665 --> 00:12:09,255
he was a young teen and he

319
00:12:09,255 --> 00:12:10,605
was a medium that would read like

320
00:12:10,755 --> 00:12:13,155
celebrities but was he the hollywood medium

321
00:12:13,185 --> 00:12:14,985

326
00:12:21,585 --> 00:12:24,195

371
00:13:51,225 --> 00:13:53,145
instagram post saying that i should watch

372
00:13:53,145 --> 00:13:54,765
that because if i liked nick sam

373
00:13:54,765 --> 00:13:57,225
i'll love this is that true yeah

374
00:13:57,255 --> 00:13:59,655
it's only four episodes so very manageable

375
00:13:59,775 --> 00:14:01,395
can you tell me too much she

376
00:14:01,395 --> 00:14:03,765
he is a coy character i can't

377
00:14:03,765 --> 00:14:05,295
wait i wanna watch this and so

378
00:14:05,655 --> 00:14:07,275
is it a is it a reality

379
00:14:07,275 --> 00:14:08,385
show of her or is it just

380
00:14:08,505 --> 00:14:10,815
watching a documentary about her and she

381
00:14:10,815 --> 00:14:14,355
was literally a grifter that's known yeah

382
00:14:14,415 --> 00:14:15,945
it's it's very obvious when you watch

383
00:14:15,957 --> 00:14:17,475
this thing can she sue you paul

384
00:14:17,475 --> 00:14:19,875
for saying ah ooh thought about that

385
00:14:19,935 --> 00:14:21,075
why are you going assume me

386
00:14:22,425 --> 00:14:24,525
unforeseen no but i'm just saying like

387
00:14:24,585 --> 00:14:25,935
you don't believe in it so you

388
00:14:25,935 --> 00:14:27,435
might just say that about well because

389
00:14:27,435 --> 00:14:29,505
she's not she's not just a medium

390
00:14:29,505 --> 00:14:32,505
that's that's like her her supernatural gifts

391
00:14:32,535 --> 00:14:34,005
are just like a sort of side

392
00:14:34,005 --> 00:14:35,895
thing it's a sort of way she

393
00:14:36,315 --> 00:14:38,355
is like she's able to prove what

394
00:14:38,355 --> 00:14:40,425
she's saying to people is like well

395
00:14:40,455 --> 00:14:41,715
i could talk to dead people

396
00:14:41,745 --> 00:14:44,535
so they said this or whatever she's

397
00:14:44,565 --> 00:14:47,535
rightly like a self-help guru um it's

398
00:14:47,535 --> 00:14:50,865
very intense and she is clearly like

399
00:14:50,895 --> 00:14:53,145
a like when you watch this thing

400
00:14:53,445 --> 00:14:55,395
you're very much aware that she thought

401
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:57,045
this would portray her in a positive

402
00:14:57,045 --> 00:14:59,895
light oh the doc uh-huh yes like

403
00:14:59,895 --> 00:15:01,875
she doesn't realize that people

404
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:03,975
will because she has enough people that

405
00:15:04,275 --> 00:15:06,885
are willing to pay for her nonsense

406
00:15:07,215 --> 00:15:09,495
um she doesn't realize like and the

407
00:15:09,495 --> 00:15:10,965
average person looking in on this is

408
00:15:10,965 --> 00:15:12,525
gonna say oh she's like a monstrous

409
00:15:12,525 --> 00:15:16,935
person who has severe ah issues like

410
00:15:16,995 --> 00:15:18,465
you're yeah trying to say that she's

411
00:15:18,465 --> 00:15:20,925
so far up her own ass yes

412
00:15:21,135 --> 00:15:21,975
she can see

413
00:15:22,035 --> 00:15:25,005
at our eyeballs yeah yeah yeah yeah

414
00:15:25,005 --> 00:15:25,185
yeah

415
00:15:26,415 --> 00:15:28,035
that's what you're trying to say she's

416
00:15:28,035 --> 00:15:29,985
so far gone she can stay out

417
00:15:29,985 --> 00:15:31,363
of her eyeballs yeah that's what it

418
00:15:31,363 --> 00:15:34,395
was trying to say yeah so couldn't

419
00:15:34,395 --> 00:15:35,895
get it out so but lorin you

420
00:15:35,955 --> 00:15:38,115
you believe what she said while i

421
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:41,175
believe in it when someone seems to

422
00:15:41,175 --> 00:15:42,975
really have the ability i feel that

423
00:15:42,975 --> 00:15:45,195
i can not believe in it when

424
00:15:45,195 --> 00:15:46,515
it feels fake or it feels

425
00:15:46,545 --> 00:15:48,795
like you know i've had some experiences

426
00:15:48,795 --> 00:15:51,525
where i with um mediums i did

427
00:15:51,525 --> 00:15:53,415
a podcast where i went and met

428
00:15:53,415 --> 00:15:54,795
with a few people that's part of

429
00:15:54,795 --> 00:15:57,585
that was called it was called psychic

430
00:15:57,585 --> 00:16:00,735
show doesn't exist anywhere because it's probably

431
00:16:00,735 --> 00:16:03,225
on stitcher premium um it's so it's

432
00:16:03,225 --> 00:16:04,815
so irrelevant to my life now that

433
00:16:04,815 --> 00:16:05,865
like i don't know i can't even

434
00:16:05,865 --> 00:16:06,495
imagine

435
00:16:06,825 --> 00:16:08,715
that would be that interesting honestly um

436
00:16:08,775 --> 00:16:10,035
not that it matters i guess what

437
00:16:10,035 --> 00:16:11,505
my life is but you don't i

438
00:16:11,505 --> 00:16:12,315
mean i don't know just like a

439
00:16:12,315 --> 00:16:13,635
long time ago i feel like at

440
00:16:13,635 --> 00:16:15,195
the time i remember talking to you

441
00:16:15,195 --> 00:16:17,108
about it and you i hope it's

442
00:16:17,115 --> 00:16:18,585
okay to say this that you felt

443
00:16:18,585 --> 00:16:23,625
like you ah this sort of seeker

444
00:16:23,895 --> 00:16:25,965
aspect of it for you was kind

445
00:16:25,965 --> 00:16:26,775
of satisfied

446
00:16:26,835 --> 00:16:29,265
by that experience yeah it wasn't something

447
00:16:29,265 --> 00:16:31,575
that you really pursued much yeah i'm

448
00:16:31,575 --> 00:16:33,135
not like somebody who's always checking in

449
00:16:33,135 --> 00:16:35,025
with some medium about like what i

450
00:16:35,025 --> 00:16:36,675
should do next my life although i

451
00:16:36,675 --> 00:16:37,755
do know a lot of people who

452
00:16:37,785 --> 00:16:39,465
use astrologers and think and i think

453
00:16:39,465 --> 00:16:41,205
that's fun and i think it can

454
00:16:41,205 --> 00:16:42,765
be really accurate and also i think

455
00:16:42,795 --> 00:16:44,175
can be really helpful like one thing

456
00:16:44,175 --> 00:16:45,735
that i think i love watching the

457
00:16:45,735 --> 00:16:46,965
long island medium and

458
00:16:47,025 --> 00:16:48,555
i even the times when i don't

459
00:16:48,555 --> 00:16:51,135

461
00:16:54,165 --> 00:16:57,375

00:16:57,375 --> 00:16:59,595
of you know comfort to people that

463
00:16:59,595 --> 00:17:01,635

it's not as

504
00:18:23,235 --> 00:18:25,965
necessarily or treaters what i liked about

505
00:18:25,965 --> 00:18:28,275
the show because they're filming it like

506
00:18:28,275 --> 00:18:31,125
documentary style that he says they're day

507
00:18:31,905 --> 00:18:35,445
that become the get proven within hours

508
00:18:36,405 --> 00:18:37,485
that there's no way he could have

509
00:18:37,485 --> 00:18:40,245
known one example being he's doing a

510
00:18:40,245 --> 00:18:42,585
reading for two people that he um

511
00:18:43,005 --> 00:18:43,335
knew

512
00:18:43,425 --> 00:18:45,195
he was younger that goes back to

513
00:18:45,195 --> 00:18:48,315
visit them and he basically brings up

514
00:18:48,645 --> 00:18:50,295
do you know anything about a fire

515
00:18:50,385 --> 00:18:52,005
they're saying it's too hot do you

516
00:18:52,035 --> 00:18:54,945
know anything about our area wait okay

517
00:18:54,945 --> 00:18:57,015
somebody's somebody's communicating him from hell is

518
00:18:57,015 --> 00:18:58,725
that what's going on they were saying

519
00:18:58,755 --> 00:19:00,975
they were saying don't trust this guy

520
00:19:01,005 --> 00:19:02,595
he's like that's what i'm getting when

521
00:19:02,595 --> 00:19:03,525
i'm getting the the

522
00:19:03,585 --> 00:19:05,055
images that i'm getting are don't touch

523
00:19:05,055 --> 00:19:07,005
the fire it's too hot do you

524
00:19:07,035 --> 00:19:08,385
know anything about a house fire or

525
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:10,335
fire in a building there going no

526
00:19:10,335 --> 00:19:11,325
no that doesn't ring any bells he's

527
00:19:11,325 --> 00:19:12,519
like ma i don't know what to

528
00:19:12,519 --> 00:19:13,725
tell you that's what i was getting

529
00:19:13,905 --> 00:19:15,495
like he's so in my opinion it

530
00:19:15,495 --> 00:19:17,895
felt like oh maybe he's wrong and

531
00:19:17,895 --> 00:19:20,295
then he sits an hours later hey

532
00:19:20,295 --> 00:19:22,725
say it was a fire that someone

533
00:19:22,725 --> 00:19:23,685
later confessed to

534
00:19:23,745 --> 00:19:26,385
setting so it wasn't and it was

535
00:19:26,385 --> 00:19:28,305
ah an in a chinese like sort

536
00:19:28,305 --> 00:19:31,125
of museum of sorts like ah center

537
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:32,925
where they showed like historical artifacts as

538
00:19:32,955 --> 00:19:34,875
these people were at that they work

539
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:37,335
they owned that they owned and it

540
00:19:37,335 --> 00:19:39,045
got set on fire by a person

541
00:19:39,075 --> 00:19:42,825
a transient it said later confessed and

542
00:19:42,885 --> 00:19:43,875
they were going through town and they

543
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:45,881
just set a fight so decided hey

544
00:19:45,885 --> 00:19:47,565
would never set it on fire whew

545
00:19:47,625 --> 00:19:50,895
that's a that's a historical building i

546
00:19:50,895 --> 00:19:52,515
wanna give you my janet varnished opinion

547
00:19:52,965 --> 00:19:55,665
um i don't buy it and i

548
00:19:55,665 --> 00:19:57,405
think there's always an explanation for these

549
00:19:57,405 --> 00:19:59,655
things that was an example of one

550
00:19:59,655 --> 00:20:02,505
that was like there there's a camera

551
00:20:02,505 --> 00:20:03,975
filming him he says

552
00:20:04,035 --> 00:20:05,655
this thing and then it came through

553
00:20:05,685 --> 00:20:07,845
like it's a little different when it's

554
00:20:07,965 --> 00:20:09,857
so a dead person you know sire

555
00:20:09,857 --> 00:20:11,295
at talking if if it was like

556
00:20:11,295 --> 00:20:12,825
a fire at their house

557
00:20:14,415 --> 00:20:16,575
maybe and a serious fire not like

558
00:20:16,725 --> 00:20:18,045
not just like it was a serious

559
00:20:18,045 --> 00:20:19,904
fire know like noah's i'm saying a

560
00:20:19,904 --> 00:20:21,345
serious fire at their house but it's

561
00:20:21,405 --> 00:20:22,875
a fire and why does it matter

562
00:20:22,875 --> 00:20:25,995
if it's not serious meaning like a

563
00:20:26,025 --> 00:20:27,345
grease fire you put out in twenty

564
00:20:27,345 --> 00:20:29,805
seconds oh well yeah right that would

565
00:20:29,805 --> 00:20:31,485
that would be less impressive you're saying

566
00:20:31,515 --> 00:20:32,865
like but without but that would be

567
00:20:32,865 --> 00:20:34,035
something that i think people would go

568
00:20:34,655 --> 00:20:35,675
see he said the fire and you

569
00:20:35,675 --> 00:20:37,355
put it out in twenty seconds that's

570
00:20:37,355 --> 00:20:38,983
what because of his warning good for

571
00:20:38,983 --> 00:20:40,535
you can i also say twenty seconds

572
00:20:40,535 --> 00:20:42,305
yeah long time to have a fire

573
00:20:42,335 --> 00:20:43,985
in your home that you're trying to

574
00:20:43,985 --> 00:20:44,345
put out

575
00:20:45,425 --> 00:20:48,335
yeah well you know agrees fire i'm

576
00:20:48,335 --> 00:20:50,195
just saying it's a good show i

577
00:20:50,195 --> 00:20:51,635
think there will always be something in

578
00:20:51,635 --> 00:20:53,225
your life that you can trace back

579
00:20:53,345 --> 00:20:54,725
oh no i do think that is

580
00:20:54,755 --> 00:20:56,615
realistic like that and i actually like

581
00:20:56,645 --> 00:20:58,595
i've talked about this on another podcast

582
00:20:58,595 --> 00:21:01,145

583
00:21:01,145 --> 00:21:02,735
of how i could do that same

584
00:21:02,735 --> 00:21:04,745
skill and like lead you into saying

585
00:21:04,745 --> 00:21:05,585
things that make it makes

586
00:21:05,585 --> 00:21:06,725

not psychic reads but they they they

617
00:22:21,065 --> 00:22:22,535
the their whole thing is they communicate

with the spirit realm and blah blah

619
00:22:23,945 --> 00:22:26,195

of this movement have been were discredited

621
00:22:29,075 --> 00:22:30,455
a long time ago like in their

622
00:22:30,455 --> 00:22:33,785
own lifetimes the thing still like they

623
00:22:33,785 --> 00:22:37,145
confess to ah just like faking all

624
00:22:37,145 --> 00:22:40,385
these you know spirit visitations noises shit

625
00:22:40,385 --> 00:22:43,375

626
00:22:43,375 --> 00:22:45,245
okay after they were well that's interesting

627
00:22:45,275 --> 00:22:46,295
i would like to listen to that

628
00:22:46,595 --> 00:22:48,875
yeah it's from it's great one more

629
00:22:48,875 --> 00:22:51,485
thing yeah is that helps just one

630
00:22:51,485 --> 00:22:53,405
more thing we've learned yeah can you

631
00:22:53,405 --> 00:22:56,645

632
00:22:56,675 --> 00:22:57,763
one oh really

633
00:22:59,585 --> 00:23:01,685
with lowering is

634
00:23:02,825 --> 00:23:05,165
one mah things sound like there was

635
00:23:05,165 --> 00:23:06,395
an argument in the middle of that

636
00:23:06,425 --> 00:23:07,955
theme so i think there was and

637
00:23:07,955 --> 00:23:09,305
we have to recreate that every it's

638
00:23:09,635 --> 00:23:10,625
weird themes

639
00:23:11,975 --> 00:23:14,015
i like it to songwriters yeah two

640
00:23:14,015 --> 00:23:15,185
people start seeing you at the same

641
00:23:15,185 --> 00:23:17,585
time completely different songs that have a

642
00:23:17,585 --> 00:23:18,335
mini arc

643
00:23:20,555 --> 00:23:23,375
it's a third person comes in he

644
00:23:23,375 --> 00:23:25,955
will say things that only that person

645
00:23:25,955 --> 00:23:28,535
would not really specific thing only that

646
00:23:28,535 --> 00:23:30,215
person would know they haven't talked about

647
00:23:30,215 --> 00:23:32,345
it like for example his high school

648
00:23:32,345 --> 00:23:33,575
teacher who you see on the show

649
00:23:34,055 --> 00:23:36,125
he like in high school came up

650
00:23:36,125 --> 00:23:38,405
to her and said something specific like

651
00:23:38,435 --> 00:23:39,635
lorraine says you

652
00:23:39,755 --> 00:23:41,225
it's okay to cry or whatever and

653
00:23:41,225 --> 00:23:43,115
she was like she had just that

654
00:23:43,235 --> 00:23:44,825
someone who had died he didn't know

655
00:23:44,825 --> 00:23:47,615
that she hadn't told him that what

656
00:23:47,615 --> 00:23:48,545
if i came up to me it

657
00:23:48,545 --> 00:23:50,195
was impossible to find it out the

658
00:23:50,465 --> 00:23:51,035
secret

659
00:23:52,325 --> 00:23:55,955

00:26:55,685 --> 00:26:58,145
envy you when did you gamble it

738
00:26:58,145 --> 00:27:01,100
all paul you're not no money yeah

739
00:27:01,185 --> 00:27:02,735
your life i gamble with my time

740
00:27:02,735 --> 00:27:04,715
for sure um yeah but i i'm

741
00:27:04,715 --> 00:27:06,515
not a big gambler i might gamble

742
00:27:06,545 --> 00:27:07,775
while i'm here janie likes to play

743
00:27:07,775 --> 00:27:10,955
craps really which is what's her what's

744
00:27:10,955 --> 00:27:12,125
her number that she likes to get

745
00:27:12,635 --> 00:27:13,325
for

746
00:27:13,805 --> 00:27:16,145
what is crops i feel like i

747
00:27:16,145 --> 00:27:17,585
just always go along three roll the

748
00:27:17,585 --> 00:27:19,685
dice roll the dice and hope exactly

749
00:27:19,685 --> 00:27:21,545
like the first your first roll if

750
00:27:21,545 --> 00:27:23,165
you get a seven you win but

751
00:27:23,165 --> 00:27:24,845
if you get any thing else other

752
00:27:24,845 --> 00:27:26,165
than two

753
00:27:27,185 --> 00:27:28,805
is that right too or yeah she's

754
00:27:28,805 --> 00:27:29,735
got a seventy win but if you

755
00:27:29,735 --> 00:27:31,715
get anything else other than two and

756
00:27:31,835 --> 00:27:33,455
then you have already lost and i've

757
00:27:33,455 --> 00:27:35,465
seen this you have to roll again

758
00:27:35,465 --> 00:27:37,415
and match that number before you get

759
00:27:37,415 --> 00:27:39,245
another seven because seven is the most

760
00:27:39,245 --> 00:27:41,555
common number that you can roll and

761
00:27:41,555 --> 00:27:43,145
so you only can roll once in

762
00:27:43,145 --> 00:27:46,295
the next person rolls know you knew

763
00:27:46,325 --> 00:27:47,315
you bet you can roll as

764
00:27:47,375 --> 00:27:48,485
as long as you usually when you

765
00:27:48,515 --> 00:27:50,165
crap out as they say meaning you

766
00:27:50,165 --> 00:27:51,515
get a seven before you match your

767
00:27:51,515 --> 00:27:54,455
point it's customary to like pass the

768
00:27:54,455 --> 00:27:56,315
dice on because you're no longer lucky

769
00:27:56,345 --> 00:27:57,725
if that makes sense but that seems

770
00:27:57,725 --> 00:27:59,495
fun that seems like roulette and that

771
00:27:59,495 --> 00:28:02,435
seems like equally random craps is the

772
00:28:02,435 --> 00:28:05,315
funnest table in the casino yeah because

773
00:28:05,315 --> 00:28:07,055

00:28:14,255 --> 00:28:16,535
like hitting their point or like you

780
00:28:16,535 --> 00:28:18,305
know rolling seven on the first roll

781
00:28:18,335 --> 00:28:20,705

00:29:35,795 --> 00:29:38,795
norman lear who is yeah kept kept

817
00:29:38,795 --> 00:29:41,225
his ah marbles and his politics and

00:29:41,255 --> 00:29:43,625
you know it's true seems like still

819
00:29:43,625 --> 00:29:44,735
seems like a cool guy he's almost

820
00:29:44,735 --> 00:29:46,145
one hundred years old right maybe it's

821
00:29:46,145 --> 00:29:47,465
the i don't have to get bad

822
00:29:47,465 --> 00:29:48,275
opinions to have it

823
00:29:48,305 --> 00:29:50,285
older people who happens to get older

824
00:29:50,285 --> 00:29:51,755
probably also have bad opinions when they

825
00:29:51,755 --> 00:29:53,705
were younger maybe but i but i

826
00:29:53,705 --> 00:29:55,985
also think that the internet preys upon

827
00:29:55,985 --> 00:29:58,145
old people in and is is a

828
00:29:58,145 --> 00:29:59,915
way will just mean it's not just

829
00:29:59,915 --> 00:30:01,625
old people but lonely people in general

830
00:30:01,625 --> 00:30:03,005
and people well there was a really

831
00:30:03,005 --> 00:30:05,195
interesting profile oh my god did you

832
00:30:05,195 --> 00:30:07,685
hear about that woman eleanor rigby she

833
00:30:07,685 --> 00:30:08,465
got yeah

834
00:30:08,551 --> 00:30:11,405
by the internet yeah but they're not

835
00:30:12,395 --> 00:30:15,725
there's a profile on yeah i a

836
00:30:15,725 --> 00:30:17,885
woman in the midwest who is supporting

837
00:30:17,915 --> 00:30:23,165
a particularly odorous political candidate and um

838
00:30:23,195 --> 00:30:24,635
it was a profile on her and

839
00:30:24,635 --> 00:30:25,865
it was really the the part that

840
00:30:25,865 --> 00:30:28,625
i found really interesting was her talking

841
00:30:28,655 --> 00:30:31,985
about how without this she feels very

842
00:30:31,985 --> 00:30:34,175
adrift in her life and like nothing

843
00:30:34,175 --> 00:30:37,865
matters and she's like ah she just

844
00:30:37,865 --> 00:30:40,145
feels this existential dread and she's like

845
00:30:40,175 --> 00:30:41,735
you know she was talking about she

846
00:30:41,735 --> 00:30:44,315
was building ah ah floor for for

847
00:30:44,375 --> 00:30:46,565
these political rally she was having she's

848
00:30:46,565 --> 00:30:48,335
like i can hold this screw and

849
00:30:48,335 --> 00:30:48,785
i know that

850
00:30:49,495 --> 00:30:52,405
real and i'm real but you know

851
00:30:52,405 --> 00:30:53,515
the more time i spend on the

852
00:30:53,515 --> 00:30:55,885
internet you know i don't know it

853
00:30:55,885 --> 00:30:58,015
was very interesting just that that people

854
00:30:58,705 --> 00:31:01,015
people people's lives they feel like you

855
00:31:01,015 --> 00:31:02,095
know what is the whole point of

856
00:31:02,095 --> 00:31:03,745
it and they sort of feel like

857
00:31:03,775 --> 00:31:05,065
you know if they attached themselves to

858
00:31:05,065 --> 00:31:07,945
these really weird opinions that it's making

859
00:31:07,945 --> 00:31:09,235
life worthwhile you know

860
00:31:09,655 --> 00:31:10,854
well what's so strange to me is

861
00:31:10,854 --> 00:31:12,985
like there's other communities you don't mean

862
00:31:13,015 --> 00:31:14,305
like you don't have to fall into

863
00:31:14,305 --> 00:31:15,925
that community if you're looking if you're

864
00:31:15,925 --> 00:31:18,655
looking to to ah you know connect

865
00:31:18,655 --> 00:31:21,175
with people there's there's communities that don't

866
00:31:21,175 --> 00:31:21,865
feel like

867
00:31:23,785 --> 00:31:25,405
anyone who disagrees with politically is a

868
00:31:25,405 --> 00:31:27,415
pedophile you know what i mean yeah

869
00:31:27,445 --> 00:31:29,755
like there's there's people there's hobbies and

870
00:31:29,755 --> 00:31:33,025
stuff yeah there's like model trains one

871
00:31:33,025 --> 00:31:34,405
or more old people get into pokemon

872
00:31:35,515 --> 00:31:37,645
it's right i want a playing animal

873
00:31:37,645 --> 00:31:40,255
crossing they would love animal crossing they

874
00:31:40,264 --> 00:31:43,765
would love it that maybe they feel

875
00:31:43,765 --> 00:31:45,565
like they can't pick up the controllers

876
00:31:45,565 --> 00:31:47,965
with their arthritic hands oh i need

877
00:31:47,965 --> 00:31:49,345
to pay ridge but i'm out of

878
00:31:49,345 --> 00:31:50,065
bows

879
00:31:52,435 --> 00:31:54,115
raccoon will evict me

880
00:31:56,755 --> 00:31:58,015
is that what it is i've never

881
00:31:58,045 --> 00:31:59,125
played it oh that's what it is

882
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:00,925
yeah i've played before crossing is weird

883
00:32:00,925 --> 00:32:02,395
it's a weird game you've played what

884
00:32:02,545 --> 00:32:04,735
i played the course on ah ah

885
00:32:04,786 --> 00:32:06,985
the mario kart eight yeah of course

886
00:32:07,285 --> 00:32:08,395
i mean it's a weird game but

887
00:32:08,395 --> 00:32:10,365
it was like really a comforting game

888
00:32:10,375 --> 00:32:11,485
with being in the pandemic i had

889
00:32:11,485 --> 00:32:13,255
never played before was but it was

890
00:32:13,255 --> 00:32:14,845
like my little world that i was

891
00:32:14,845 --> 00:32:15,295
in

892
00:32:15,325 --> 00:32:17,575
and it felt just like your world

893
00:32:17,575 --> 00:32:20,305
was not constricting but rather expanding exactly

894
00:32:20,305 --> 00:32:22,045
i was going to say do you

895
00:32:22,045 --> 00:32:24,355

897
00:32:25,846 --> 00:32:28,255
one time it was always so great

00:40:11,785 --> 00:40:14,125
made chevron listened to all of these

1102
00:40:14,125 --> 00:40:17,275
beforehand all of them he refused to

1103
00:40:17,275 --> 00:40:18,295
do it and we said no you

1104
00:40:18,295 --> 00:40:19,525
have to do it we need him

1105
00:40:19,525 --> 00:40:21,355
do it we pay your salaries what

1106
00:40:22,615 --> 00:40:23,905
like that lady in the patti lupone

1107
00:40:23,995 --> 00:40:24,895
yeah exactly

1108
00:40:27,205 --> 00:40:30,445
and so he then he was forced

1109
00:40:30,445 --> 00:40:31,435
to listen to them all but then

1110
00:40:31,435 --> 00:40:32,965
we didn't force him to sort them

1111
00:40:32,965 --> 00:40:35,035
out into like this is worthwhile or

1112
00:40:35,035 --> 00:40:37,135
this isn't worthwhile he actually paid us

1113
00:40:37,135 --> 00:40:38,755
to do that it was listen to

1114
00:40:38,755 --> 00:40:40,105
them all and let us sort them

1115
00:40:40,105 --> 00:40:42,355

1116
00:40:42,415 --> 00:40:44,665
can you just can i pay you

1117
00:40:44,995 --> 00:40:46,225
five hundred dollars and

1118
00:40:46,585 --> 00:40:48,355
for the for the honor of sorting

1119
00:40:48,355 --> 00:40:50,695
these into different categories and make no

1120
00:40:50,695 --> 00:40:52,645
mistake this is for the honor it's

1121
00:40:52,645 --> 00:40:54,115
for the glory of law yeah that's

1122
00:40:54,115 --> 00:40:55,825

1124
00:40:56,875 --> 00:40:59,965

game that makes it past one time

1217
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:28,690
well definitely not awkward if it passes

1218
00:44:28,690 --> 00:44:29,500
the three minutes

1219
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:32,260
to have sex with all of them

1220
00:44:33,850 --> 00:44:36,400
um i didn't go to mine because

1221
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,680
i wasn't invited but i did see

1222
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:40,870
like facebook or something that it was

1223
00:44:40,870 --> 00:44:44,230
happening on point and i never got

1224
00:44:44,230 --> 00:44:46,360
the information was just like a twenty

1225
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:48,550
year it would be ten it was

1226
00:44:48,550 --> 00:44:50,710
my ten years your tenure but even

1227
00:44:50,710 --> 00:44:51,520
then it was like we already had

1228
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:52,630
facebook and it kind of felt like

1229
00:44:52,630 --> 00:44:53,500
i knew what everyone was

1230
00:44:53,590 --> 00:44:54,910
and you just ate that is the

1231
00:44:54,910 --> 00:44:56,620
thing too yeah yeah that seem weird

1232
00:44:56,620 --> 00:44:57,430
in this day and age where you

1233
00:44:57,430 --> 00:44:58,930
can keep in touch with people from

1234
00:44:58,930 --> 00:45:01,150
your past so easily if i'm gonna

1235
00:45:01,150 --> 00:45:03,100
say if why are you going if

1236
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:04,660
you're needing a game to not make

1237
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:07,077
it awkward well i mean the person

1238
00:45:07,102 --> 00:45:08,590
wants to see everyone and see what

1239
00:45:08,590 --> 00:45:10,240
they're up to yeah you know like

1240
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:11,770
i think i think what what was

1241
00:45:11,770 --> 00:45:13,540
refreshing like go into skies

1242
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:16,120
yeah yeah whereas guys sash i'm like

1243
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:19,120
a long wig and then to what's

1244
00:45:19,330 --> 00:45:21,220
from boots what are you doing these

1245
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:23,200
days i think what was refreshing about

1246
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:24,670
the ten year for me is just

1247
00:45:24,670 --> 00:45:28,300
how everyone was really nervous and everyone

1248
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:30,760
was sort of like feeling judged and

1249
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:33,160
then i had i saw someone that

1250
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:33,880
i kind of bear

1251
00:45:33,880 --> 00:45:35,860
rly new and and i was talking

1252
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:36,640
to i was like what are you

1253
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:38,590
up to she's like well i'm unemployed

1254
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:41,590
i'm living with my parents and things

1255
00:45:41,590 --> 00:45:43,600

1256
00:45:43,630 --> 00:45:46,330
honest now refreshing and she wasn't she

1257

wasn't putting on airs show wasn't trying

1258
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:49,420
to impress anyone i thought that was

1259
00:45:49,420 --> 00:45:50,860
really cool and so i decided just

1260
00:45:51,100 --> 00:45:52,090
that it would be sort of like

1261
00:45:52,090 --> 00:45:53,890
that and i think everyone is really

1262
00:45:53,890 --> 00:45:54,040
no

1263
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:56,410
service and everyone is worried and when

1264
00:45:56,410 --> 00:45:58,300
you realize that you go in and

1265
00:45:58,300 --> 00:45:59,920
just like try to put everyone at

1266
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:03,610
ease and and be non-judgmental because everyone's

1267
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:05,530
no one's judging you everyone's feeling that's

1268
00:46:05,530 --> 00:46:07,330
right everybody puts their pants on one

1269
00:46:07,330 --> 00:46:08,410
leg at a time it's just that

1270
00:46:08,410 --> 00:46:10,240
some people are more successful than you

1271
00:46:10,570 --> 00:46:12,640
i don't i jump into my pants

00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:13,780

to try

1274
00:46:14,260 --> 00:46:16,690
