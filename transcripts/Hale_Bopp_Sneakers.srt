198
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:04,560
i had to make it seem religious

00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:07,530
but it was not religious gone dunk

200
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:08,400
this baby

201
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:14,130
i don't think i would do it

202
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:16,200
for anyone that i wasn't close with

203
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:18,420
yeah i don't know absolutely nobody who

204
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:19,980
hasn't really quest to do it for

205
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:23,190
for fans or whatever i think it's

206
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:25,320
too i think it's too big of

207
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,850
a responsibility to do it for someone

208
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:27,960
you don't know all that well and

209
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,220
i also think that if you're a

210
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:29,760
fan you should

211
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:32,100
wouldn't want that you might get someone

214
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:36,810

287
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,950
but one thing we may have talked

288
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:00,180
about this before but one thing that

289
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,002
always makes me laugh for some reason

290
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:04,410
is when people talk about sex as

291
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:07,440
fun it's really fucking that was fun

292
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:09,660
like hey man um i had sex

like it's it's own thing like it's

more than yeah it's like fun it's

296
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:16,320

297
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,280
i think make sense

298
00:10:18,085 --> 00:10:18,775

299
00:10:20,755 --> 00:10:22,525
oh but i was gonna say that

300
00:10:22,525 --> 00:10:24,775
my high school friends and i were

301
00:10:24,835 --> 00:10:26,275
trying to come up with some gossip

302
00:10:26,275 --> 00:10:28,675
about people to kind of you know

303
00:10:28,675 --> 00:10:31,015
entertain each other right it's it's hard

304
00:10:31,015 --> 00:10:32,935
to come by it really is we

305
00:10:32,935 --> 00:10:35,185
had a couple little news stories like

306
00:10:35,185 --> 00:10:37,795

00:10:37,795 --> 00:10:39,475
like then like the last time we

308
00:10:39,475 --> 00:10:39,925

309
00:10:39,955 --> 00:10:41,185
the beginning of the pandemic we ended

310
00:10:41,185 --> 00:10:43,375
up googling some people on a share

where's that guy he gives someone like

313
00:10:47,185 --> 00:10:49,915

no one's been in touch yeah and

315
00:10:52,045 --> 00:10:52,975

328
00:11:18,625 --> 00:11:20,965

demographic are like imo someone getting divorced

338
00:11:39,685 --> 00:11:42,025
or someone getting engaged someone having a

339
00:11:42,025 --> 00:11:44,275
baby like that's usually the gossip so

340
00:11:44,275 --> 00:11:47,245
it's not that exciting but it's interesting

341
00:11:47,275 --> 00:11:49,735
do you ever think about the the

342
00:11:49,735 --> 00:11:50,515

613
00:20:47,410 --> 00:20:48,340
waistline sunshine

614
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:50,470
instead she jim j bullock to me

615
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:55,060
i think there's i have so many

616
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:56,800
stories from my past that run like

617
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:58,420
oh i didn't know how to say

618
00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:01,720
yeah the thing oh right yeah and

619
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:04,000
be clear absolutely but how how other

620
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,290
way you know what i mean like

621
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:06,640
i was bad at it all the

622
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,080
way but what's weird is no one

623
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:09,610
i mean my parents certainly didn't never

624
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:10,750
teach me how to do that how

625
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:11,590
are you ever supposed to

626
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:13,930
no you know i mean from movies

627
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:16,420
that's actually why i was trying to

628
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:17,890
do yeah that's why everything was so

629
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:19,540
fucking yeah it was like why isn't

630
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:21,070
this working like a movie it's like

631
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:22,780
the movie actually it goes badly for

632
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:24,700
a while too yeah so eventually you

633
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:25,570
will be in love with me

634
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:30,370
yeah i mean that as parents shouldn't

635
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:32,170
if you end up being a parent

636
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:35,590
of a person dropping their shouldn't shouldn't

637
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:36,820
there be a point where you say

638
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:38,320
to your child oh by the way

639
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,600
they're going to be situations you're in

640
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:43,030
where someone who really likes you that

641
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:44,590
you're not into is going to ask

642
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:46,300
you out yes i do think here

643
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:46,597
is

644
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:49,360
really are good at explaining right i

645
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,820
don't i my parents it was more

646
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:53,710
like you're not even gonna date so

647
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:55,210
don't even worry about that kind of

648
00:21:55,210 --> 00:21:57,070
thing yeah i feel like it's like

649
00:21:57,130 --> 00:22:00,940
it's a imagine that it gets better

650
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:03,130
and better with generations that like the

651
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:05,110
more in touch we are as we

652
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:06,670
go through life and like the more

653
00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:07,030
the

654
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:08,560
mori the next generation that goes to

655
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,480
therapy and the generation after that starts

656
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:12,130
like utilize what they learned in therapy

657
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:15,100
like it's like we start to actually

658
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:18,400
disperse this information in a really usable

659
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,470
way but like i i o heart

660
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:21,460
i agree with that but i do

661
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:24,190
think to slow the spread feels very

662
00:22:24,190 --> 00:22:25,870
slow yeah because there's still a lot

663
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:27,190
of people that are

664
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:30,220
our clinging to really old fashioned yeah

665
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:31,930
ways of doing things and it's just

666
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:34,240
like it's you're perpetuating this dumb shit

667
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:35,620
that we need to get rid of

668
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:37,630
yeah um because you think it's a

669
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:38,920
black and white world and this is

670
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:41,500
the way things are and it's just

671
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,360
not it's just not that way but

672
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:46,720
i don't know i i i wish

673
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,350
that i had had

674
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:51,220
had some guidance in that way because

675
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:52,990
i just was so bad i was

676
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:56,080
like i didn't realize until much later

677
00:22:56,530 --> 00:23:00,220
that i was ah like terrible with

678
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:02,320
stuff like that like so bad and

679
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,700
i don't mean like awkward i mean

680
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:06,640
like i was i caused pain for

681
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,510
p yeah you know

682
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:10,120
like i i made things miserable and

683
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:13,450
and tedious and heavy because yeah you

684
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:15,220
know that was that was the turmoil

685
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:17,080
that was going on in me and

686
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:19,120
like all all i got was like

687
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:21,010
i remember my mom saying like someday

688
00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:22,510
this won't matter and it's like i

689
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:25,390
can't you can't someday be this is

690
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:27,670
the whole world right yeah like

691
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:30,100
that's not helpful no it's not and

692
00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:32,020
and i i mean i get i

693
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:33,310
get an impulse though because of course

694
00:23:33,310 --> 00:23:34,840
when you see somebody when you see

695
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,310
kids when i would see like my

696
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:39,130
nieces or nephews or cousins or whatever

697
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,720
that a younger go through things like

698
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,580
this where my friends kids it's like

699
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,850
you can't believe you wanna you you

700
00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:47,080
have that urge to tell them like

701
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:47,830
yeah this doesn't

702
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:49,000
it matter like you're not going to

703
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,980
remember this it's not gonna matter but

704
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:52,510
it's like they just can't hear it

705
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,280
well there's there's no point in that

706
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:56,770
because that's they literally can't think beyond

707
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:58,870
the moment oh this is all they've

708
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:00,880
experienced and that is the the stakes

709
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,110
are that high and then all the

710
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:03,670
shit that's happening to them yeah like

711
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:05,710
physic literally don't even know likely not

712
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:07,720
in life yes yeah yeah yeah

713
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:10,840
you didn't either no but i knew

714
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,700
to four o one k was yeah

715
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:14,320

touch years later i saw her name

727
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:41,380
in the credits of the sopranos she

728
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:43,270
was on the crew of the sopranos

729
00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:46,120
interesting yeah it was really wild twisting

730
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:47,470

i'd never known her to be interested

737
00:24:57,970 --> 00:24:59,830
in show business it's actually the opposite

738
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:01,390
that all of a sudden you saw

00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:29,860
that happened was i left my phone

829
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:38,110
that i'm processing and i don't realize

830
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:40,300

831
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:42,460
somehow processing it but i didn't know

832
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:43,510

871
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:57,850

what we were talking oh so at

964
00:33:15,665 --> 00:33:17,885
one point they are they're talking about

965
00:33:17,885 --> 00:33:21,095
how it's kind of like in the

966
00:33:21,095 --> 00:33:24,065
media when people's it's older than you

967
00:33:24,065 --> 00:33:24,485
think

968
00:33:24,725 --> 00:33:26,135
like we learned about it in the

969
00:33:26,165 --> 00:33:29,825
nineties you know and um because that's

970
00:33:29,825 --> 00:33:32,075
when the tragedy happened and so that

971
00:33:32,075 --> 00:33:33,335
guy was that it had been around

972
00:33:33,335 --> 00:33:36,215
longer than ever for twenty years since

973
00:33:36,215 --> 00:33:38,045
the fucking challenges yes and people were

974
00:33:38,045 --> 00:33:40,051
in it for that long and it

975
00:33:40,051 --> 00:33:43,325
got it got crazier and crazier as

976
00:33:43,325 --> 00:33:44,645
it went on of like

977
00:33:44,645 --> 00:33:45,845
like like a lot of them do

978
00:33:45,845 --> 00:33:47,975
where first it was it's a ufo

979
00:33:48,005 --> 00:33:49,805
cold and we believe you will float

980
00:33:49,811 --> 00:33:50,945
around in air ufo

981
00:33:53,465 --> 00:33:55,745
and we believe they're they're coming and

982
00:33:55,775 --> 00:33:58,655
and ah we're only meant to be

983
00:33:58,655 --> 00:33:59,885
here for a short time we're supposed

984
00:33:59,885 --> 00:34:01,715
to go to the stars with this

985
00:34:01,715 --> 00:34:04,145
ufo and they started referring to their

986
00:34:04,145 --> 00:34:06,815
bodies as vehicles and saying like this

987
00:34:06,815 --> 00:34:09,065
is this is not truly us like

988
00:34:09,065 --> 00:34:11,135
the soul resides within us but this

989
00:34:11,135 --> 00:34:12,245
ufo is going to take us

990
00:34:12,275 --> 00:34:15,275
to literally heaven that's how we're gonna

991
00:34:15,275 --> 00:34:16,385
get to heaven this ufo is gonna

992
00:34:16,398 --> 00:34:17,825
take us there and there will be

993
00:34:18,095 --> 00:34:21,425
sales in heaven yes exactly um and

994
00:34:21,425 --> 00:34:23,795
so as it went on then all

995
00:34:23,795 --> 00:34:24,965
of a sudden you know part of

996
00:34:24,965 --> 00:34:26,255
the part of the thing was the

997
00:34:26,255 --> 00:34:28,865
two main people one of them died

998
00:34:28,865 --> 00:34:31,835
of cancer and she was like their

999
00:34:31,835 --> 00:34:32,405
deal was

1000
00:34:32,435 --> 00:34:35,345
we are immortal and oh so we're

1001
00:34:35,345 --> 00:34:36,695
going to go which is great to

1002
00:34:36,695 --> 00:34:39,305
say yes because if you're ever not

1003
00:34:39,305 --> 00:34:41,645
immortal and you're dead who cares because

1004
00:34:41,645 --> 00:34:44,195
you're dead you can't get told off

1005
00:34:44,345 --> 00:34:46,415
yeah but if your partner is sticking

1006
00:34:46,415 --> 00:34:48,005
around that's the problem then it's like

1007
00:34:48,035 --> 00:34:49,655
oh i say to people or more

1008
00:34:49,685 --> 00:34:51,635
yeah yeah yeah i would say one

1009
00:34:51,635 --> 00:34:52,535
of us is immortal

1010
00:34:52,595 --> 00:34:55,145
right so what did the dude who

1011
00:34:55,325 --> 00:34:56,945
who was still there say like how

1012
00:34:56,945 --> 00:34:58,415
did he cover he had to like

1013
00:34:58,445 --> 00:35:01,415
change it and you know explain like

1014
00:35:01,415 --> 00:35:02,585
no this is also part of the

1015
00:35:02,585 --> 00:35:05,075
plan and but it sounds like the

1016
00:35:05,075 --> 00:35:07,355
the difference in this cult was this

1017
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:09,845
guy seemed to really truly believe all

1018
00:35:09,845 --> 00:35:11,195
of the stuff and it didn't seem

1019
00:35:11,195 --> 00:35:12,515
like he was scamming people

1020
00:35:12,755 --> 00:35:14,645
it seemed like this was truly what

1021
00:35:14,645 --> 00:35:16,565
he thought okay and so he was

1022
00:35:16,565 --> 00:35:17,885
just like everybody else i do adjust

1023
00:35:17,885 --> 00:35:19,715
his thoughts oh no yeah so you

1024
00:35:19,775 --> 00:35:22,085
say like oh okay well i figured

1025
00:35:22,085 --> 00:35:23,585
it out this is why should i

1026
00:35:23,615 --> 00:35:26,075
yeah so at one point in the

1027
00:35:26,075 --> 00:35:27,515
in the in the dock they talk

1028
00:35:27,515 --> 00:35:31,265
about how people were making fun of

1029
00:35:31,325 --> 00:35:32,825
this cult after they

1030
00:35:32,885 --> 00:35:35,315
he died you know because ha all

1031
00:35:35,315 --> 00:35:37,775
the details around his ers all the

1032
00:35:37,805 --> 00:35:39,849
dwell but my phasers but it was

1033
00:35:40,055 --> 00:35:41,945
was saying get to keep going this

1034
00:35:41,945 --> 00:35:43,595
was even even the nines was like

1035
00:35:43,595 --> 00:35:45,485
a less sensitive time than now where

1036
00:35:45,485 --> 00:35:47,735
people have less empathy i think you

1037
00:35:47,735 --> 00:35:49,385
think the nineties people had less empathy

1038
00:35:49,385 --> 00:35:51,665
yeah i do because i think there

1039
00:35:51,665 --> 00:35:53,045
were i think the majority

1040
00:35:53,081 --> 00:35:54,935
of people have less empathy because all

1041
00:35:54,935 --> 00:35:56,375
of the details of this were so

1042
00:35:56,375 --> 00:35:58,518
outlandish that it was very easy to

1043
00:35:58,518 --> 00:36:00,035
to go make china it was very

1044
00:36:00,035 --> 00:36:01,085
easy to make fun of them and

1045
00:36:01,085 --> 00:36:02,465
they showed like an snl sketch and

1046
00:36:03,125 --> 00:36:05,015
i remember tsunami yeah i remember we

1047
00:36:05,045 --> 00:36:06,760
did it mister show like we did

1048
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,495
it like the second season of mister

1049
00:36:08,495 --> 00:36:10,265
show we had a heaven's gate thing

1050
00:36:10,295 --> 00:36:13,205
a parody wears on brand yeah absolut

1051
00:36:13,205 --> 00:36:14,495
lately but it's like oh my god

1052
00:36:14,495 --> 00:36:16,355
i was i was a fucking part

1053
00:36:16,355 --> 00:36:17,225
of that but you were in the

1054
00:36:17,225 --> 00:36:19,385
documentary i was scared i was going

1055
00:36:19,385 --> 00:36:19,595
to be

1056
00:36:20,735 --> 00:36:22,595
i really was like as they were

1057
00:36:22,595 --> 00:36:24,545
showing things different skin wouldn't sell you

1058
00:36:24,545 --> 00:36:25,805
know residuals though

1059
00:36:27,905 --> 00:36:28,715
i don't know this was like a

1060
00:36:28,715 --> 00:36:30,785
news program i know it was maybe

1061
00:36:30,845 --> 00:36:32,015
still what i had to pay sack

1062
00:36:32,015 --> 00:36:37,835
so ah ah why wild i think

1063
00:36:37,835 --> 00:36:39,635
that if the same thing happened today

1064
00:36:39,635 --> 00:36:42,935
i think privately i would probably make

1065
00:36:42,935 --> 00:36:44,585
jokes about it to my friends maybe

1066
00:36:44,885 --> 00:36:46,614
because the details are so atlantic like

1067
00:36:46,614 --> 00:36:47,015
i don't know

1068
00:36:47,075 --> 00:36:48,395
i would make comedy out of it

1069
00:36:48,395 --> 00:36:49,895
i don't think like ethanol is doing

1070
00:36:49,925 --> 00:36:51,665
a sketch about the vow

1071
00:36:52,835 --> 00:36:54,335
or are they i don't know it's

1072
00:36:54,335 --> 00:36:55,625
been a while since i've why watch

1073
00:36:55,625 --> 00:36:56,975
it but i don't think they have

1074
00:36:57,005 --> 00:36:58,715
i think comedies for young people when

1075
00:36:58,715 --> 00:37:00,665
people don't care about stuff and comedies

1076
00:37:00,665 --> 00:37:04,145
for the callow young people that switch

1077
00:37:04,145 --> 00:37:05,585
that's what you do you make fun

1078
00:37:05,615 --> 00:37:07,115
of those people because you don't think

1079
00:37:07,115 --> 00:37:08,585
you have feelings i think i think

1080
00:37:08,585 --> 00:37:10,445
of mister show are still around like

1081
00:37:10,475 --> 00:37:12,965
not like still going after the nine

1082
00:37:13,055 --> 00:37:14,885
s but if like the new version

1083
00:37:14,885 --> 00:37:15,965
of it they would they would make

1084
00:37:15,965 --> 00:37:19,025
a ah heaven's gate or ah you

1085
00:37:19,025 --> 00:37:19,955

1086
00:37:21,275 --> 00:37:23,135
fair game for the yeah for the

1087
00:37:23,135 --> 00:37:24,275
young people who don't give a shit

sad i don't know it's hard to

1093
00:37:34,355 --> 00:37:37,145
judge it's like it was that it

1094
00:37:37,145 --> 00:37:38,465
was like trying to figure out does

1095
00:37:38,465 --> 00:37:39,935

00:37:39,935 --> 00:37:41,285

sketch just on something we hated it

give a shit that much like yeah

1118
00:38:24,455 --> 00:38:25,925
but i think at the time

1119
00:38:25,925 --> 00:38:29,555
time there was so little media that

1120
00:38:29,585 --> 00:38:33,065
kind of got made if something like

1121
00:38:33,065 --> 00:38:34,685
home improvement were out there you would

1122
00:38:34,685 --> 00:38:36,815
hate it oh because it's like

1123
00:38:37,955 --> 00:38:40,355
every person i know could do a

1124
00:38:40,355 --> 00:38:41,465
show better than this

1125
00:38:42,245 --> 00:38:44,255
right and he's the guy who gets

1126
00:38:44,255 --> 00:38:45,515
it yeah when you say you feel

1127
00:38:45,515 --> 00:38:48,095
like that life is unfair and now

1128
00:38:48,125 --> 00:38:50,165
everybody gets a show you're like hey

1129
00:38:51,545 --> 00:38:52,685
well i can't complain now i got

1130
00:38:52,685 --> 00:38:55,505
home and everyone has one television show

1131
00:38:55,625 --> 00:38:56,975
yeah and they can waste it when

1132
00:38:56,975 --> 00:38:58,775
they're two years old we already know

1133
00:39:00,095 --> 00:39:01,085
if you want to do it when

1134
00:39:01,085 --> 00:39:02,873
you're two you can can but you

1135
00:39:02,982 --> 00:39:04,355
get another one and it's not going

1136
00:39:04,355 --> 00:39:07,115
to win awards your parents also should

1137
00:39:07,296 --> 00:39:08,405
like you guys are talking about something

1138
00:39:08,405 --> 00:39:09,845
specific and i don't know what you're

1139
00:39:09,845 --> 00:39:12,335
talking about on this show the idea

1140
00:39:12,335 --> 00:39:14,705
that everyone gets a pilot everyone gets

1141
00:39:14,705 --> 00:39:16,925
one pilot my god yes and your

1142
00:39:16,925 --> 00:39:18,665
parents should be able to sew to

1143
00:39:18,665 --> 00:39:20,165
nyx until you're eight

1144
00:39:20,195 --> 00:39:21,185
team should be able to say no

1145
00:39:21,185 --> 00:39:22,455
you're not ready for the pilot because

1146
00:39:22,455 --> 00:39:24,905
some might be ready their kids my

1147
00:39:24,905 --> 00:39:27,192
grandkids really shit some kids are born

1148
00:39:27,192 --> 00:39:29,225
stall also some kids some parents shouldn't

1149
00:39:30,005 --> 00:39:31,895
force their kids to make their pilot

1150
00:39:31,895 --> 00:39:34,655
early yeah you know like here's a

1151
00:39:34,655 --> 00:39:37,055
quick stage moms here's a question if

1152
00:39:37,055 --> 00:39:38,465
you had a kid and the kid

1153
00:39:38,465 --> 00:39:40,235
was a star

1154
00:39:40,325 --> 00:39:41,555
like you just could tell you like

1155
00:39:41,555 --> 00:39:42,965
this kid is so just just so

1156
00:39:42,965 --> 00:39:45,545
outgoing so it's got wonderful would you

1157
00:39:45,545 --> 00:39:48,245
let them become a celebrity or would

1158
00:39:48,245 --> 00:39:49,535
you be like you have to wait

1159
00:39:49,535 --> 00:39:51,605
until you're eighteen this is tough because

1160
00:39:51,635 --> 00:39:54,575
everyone says that child stars are not

1161
00:39:54,575 --> 00:39:57,605
happy but but that's only because the

1162
00:39:57,605 --> 00:40:00,095
famous ones aren't and there probably are

1163
00:40:00,125 --> 00:40:00,485
other way

1164
00:40:00,485 --> 00:40:02,585
ones that are were perfectly happy and

1165
00:40:03,275 --> 00:40:04,835
so i don't know you know i

1166
00:40:04,835 --> 00:40:07,325
mean i once on mr show had

1167
00:40:07,325 --> 00:40:08,831
to audition a bunch of kids for

1168
00:40:08,831 --> 00:40:11,885
a sketch that that i wrote and

1169
00:40:11,975 --> 00:40:14,495
um you know and they were all

1170
00:40:14,525 --> 00:40:16,415

1171
00:40:16,415 --> 00:40:17,555
it and we were having a good

1172
00:40:17,555 --> 00:40:18,667
time and then one came in and

00:40:18,667 --> 00:40:19,985
it was just so bummed

1174
00:40:20,675 --> 00:40:22,805
and didn't want to be there and

1175
00:40:22,805 --> 00:40:24,005
i was saying okay say you're lying

1176
00:40:24,005 --> 00:40:25,325

1194
00:40:57,095 --> 00:41:00,395
but it just is less rough if

1195
00:41:00,395 --> 00:41:00,695

life will

1221
00:41:56,425 --> 00:41:57,655
to you you'll have a lot of

1222
00:41:57,655 --> 00:42:00,445
attention paid upon you yeah at a

1223
00:42:00,445 --> 00:42:01,705
very young age and then you have

1224
00:42:01,705 --> 00:42:03,565
so much life to live yeah after

1225
00:42:03,565 --> 00:42:05,215
that that it can seem like a

1226
00:42:05,215 --> 00:42:05,995
letdown

1227
00:42:06,685 --> 00:42:08,605
you know i know somebody i had

1228
00:42:08,605 --> 00:42:09,890
that talk with somebody who was it

1229
00:42:09,895 --> 00:42:12,145
was a young adult friends the the

1230
00:42:12,145 --> 00:42:14,725
sibling of a friend of mine and

1231
00:42:14,815 --> 00:42:16,615
ah she was thinking about getting into

1232
00:42:16,615 --> 00:42:21,715
comedy and asked me for advice and

1233
00:42:21,835 --> 00:42:24,415
i said you know i basically gave

1234
00:42:24,415 --> 00:42:25,645
her that talk i was like if

1235
00:42:25,645 --> 00:42:26,752
you really make sure you

1236
00:42:26,815 --> 00:42:29,485
really want to do this because the

1237
00:42:29,515 --> 00:42:32,905
the lows of it are crush bad

1238
00:42:32,935 --> 00:42:34,435
they're really bad and you've got to

1239
00:42:34,435 --> 00:42:35,695
get used to it you gotta get

1240
00:42:35,725 --> 00:42:38,245
be like eventually you don't you don't

1241
00:42:38,245 --> 00:42:40,075
think about it so much anymore like

1242
00:42:40,075 --> 00:42:41,695
it's it's a weird amount of rejection

1243
00:42:41,965 --> 00:42:44,005
that you have to absorb yeah to

1244
00:42:44,005 --> 00:42:46,375
a point where it's like suddenly you

1245
00:42:46,375 --> 00:42:46,975
won't even run

1246
00:42:46,975 --> 00:42:48,535

1251
00:42:55,195 --> 00:42:56,485
that job because i never heard back

1252
00:42:56,485 --> 00:42:58,015
from those who cares so i'm on

1253
00:42:58,015 --> 00:42:59,335

00:44:06,475 --> 00:44:07,705
this interview you did and it was

1286
00:44:07,705 --> 00:44:09,625
about it was um sam jones like

1287
00:44:09,625 --> 00:44:11,278
i heard oh yeah he's great yeah

1288
00:44:11,278 --> 00:44:13,495
and he does stick long form interviews

1289
00:44:13,615 --> 00:44:15,085
anyways and she had watched it and

1290
00:44:15,085 --> 00:44:16,195
i was like oh cool and then

1291
00:44:16,195 --> 00:44:16,675
she was like

1292
00:44:17,845 --> 00:44:20,515
she said you said that i can't

1293
00:44:20,515 --> 00:44:21,973
remember what i said exactly of course

1294
00:44:21,985 --> 00:44:23,425
that i remember anything but she was

1295
00:44:23,425 --> 00:44:25,375
like you said that people should stop

1296
00:44:25,375 --> 00:44:26,245
doing improv

1297
00:44:28,405 --> 00:44:29,818
because there's too many people doing anywhere

1298
00:44:29,818 --> 00:44:32,545
and good and that is enabling but

1299
00:44:32,665 --> 00:44:35,095
she said that's yeah i thought you

1300
00:44:35,095 --> 00:44:36,325
were gonna say it was a joke

1301
00:44:36,325 --> 00:44:37,075
but no it isn't

1302
00:44:38,095 --> 00:44:39,445
okay i do believe though because my

1303
00:44:39,475 --> 00:44:41,785
point was more that people shit on

1304
00:44:41,785 --> 00:44:43,375
improv because they see a ton of

1305
00:44:43,375 --> 00:44:45,017
bad improv because there's tons of product

1306
00:44:45,017 --> 00:44:47,425
people doing it and it's like when

1307
00:44:47,425 --> 00:44:48,355
people are really good at it it's

1308
00:44:48,355 --> 00:44:50,185
really good and when it's bad i

1309
00:44:50,185 --> 00:44:51,535
also think they don't see a ton

1310
00:44:51,535 --> 00:44:53,275
of bad improv do you know what

1311
00:44:53,275 --> 00:44:54,805
i mean i don't see any i

1312
00:44:54,925 --> 00:44:56,635
yeah i saw i saw a ton

1313
00:44:56,635 --> 00:44:58,255
about improv well coming i

1314
00:44:58,255 --> 00:44:59,635
i think it's stand ups that are

1315
00:44:59,635 --> 00:45:01,315
on these writing staffs making fun of

1316
00:45:01,315 --> 00:45:02,755
improv that's true too but i mean

1317
00:45:02,755 --> 00:45:05,095
i think people like yes yeah but

1318
00:45:05,335 --> 00:45:06,835
anyway whatever and i was i was

1319
00:45:06,835 --> 00:45:08,352
getting like nervous she's telling me this

1320
00:45:08,352 --> 00:45:09,775
because i'm like you don't usually get

1321
00:45:10,045 --> 00:45:13,255
confronted with yeah your opinion and then

1322
00:45:13,255 --> 00:45:14,575
she was known should do that by

1323
00:45:14,575 --> 00:45:16,075
the way she was able to see

1324
00:45:16,075 --> 00:45:17,485
whatever you want and no one should

1325
00:45:17,515 --> 00:45:18,355
ever call you on it

1326
00:45:18,565 --> 00:45:20,425
no and she was like and i

1327
00:45:20,455 --> 00:45:22,975
quit improv oh well she goes i

1328
00:45:22,975 --> 00:45:25,435
realized that i actually really wasn't having

1329
00:45:25,435 --> 00:45:27,205
fun from you saying that and then

1330
00:45:27,205 --> 00:45:29,545
i always kind of forcing myself to

1331
00:45:29,545 --> 00:45:30,385
do it because i thought i was

1332
00:45:30,385 --> 00:45:31,465
supposed to but now i take acting

1333
00:45:31,465 --> 00:45:32,965
classes and i love it oh okay

1334
00:45:32,995 --> 00:45:34,975
right because that's the point not everyone's

1335
00:45:34,975 --> 00:45:36,235
good an improv and it doesn't it's

1336
00:45:36,235 --> 00:45:37,645
not the only way to do something

1337
00:45:37,645 --> 00:45:38,575
and in many ways

1338
00:45:38,575 --> 00:45:39,865
aces it's not the way to do

1339
00:45:39,865 --> 00:45:42,655
something like it's a weird route to

1340
00:45:42,655 --> 00:45:45,655
getting anything so like you helped this

1341
00:45:45,715 --> 00:45:47,995
guy was relieved ultimately but i was

1342
00:45:47,995 --> 00:45:49,915
like she might she all she she

1343
00:45:49,915 --> 00:45:51,355
actually didn't say at first thought you

1344
00:45:51,355 --> 00:45:53,635
were a bitch and then i say

1345
00:45:54,175 --> 00:45:55,675
that i appreciate that yes she was

1346
00:45:55,675 --> 00:45:56,905
like at first thought you were a

1347
00:45:57,025 --> 00:45:58,380
like just a bitch but she was

1348
00:45:58,380 --> 00:45:58,645
a first

1349
00:45:59,215 --> 00:46:00,715
something like that i was like oh

1350
00:46:00,745 --> 00:46:02,335
and then she was like but then

1351
00:46:02,335 --> 00:46:04,315
i realized it was because i actually

1352
00:46:04,315 --> 00:46:05,936
like didn't really like doing it and

1353
00:46:05,936 --> 00:46:07,405
so i was kind of offended that

1354
00:46:07,405 --> 00:46:09,175
you said that but then i i'm

1355
00:46:09,175 --> 00:46:10,285
not really right for it and i

1356
00:46:10,285 --> 00:46:11,875
shouldn't do it and i'm doing acting

1357
00:46:11,875 --> 00:46:13,405
class and it's going really well and

1358
00:46:13,405 --> 00:46:14,635
i was like that's great but i

1359
00:46:14,635 --> 00:46:15,715

person thinks of a criteria or theme

or category of things that their guests

1405
00:48:03,385 --> 00:48:06,205

1406
00:48:06,205 --> 00:48:07,675

a round shaped things et cetera god

1408
00:48:10,705 --> 00:48:13,165

00:48:13,165 --> 00:48:14,575
can bring specific things to

1410
00:48:14,605 --> 00:48:16,735
