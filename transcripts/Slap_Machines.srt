and i got the crocodile silver glitter

149
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:57,540

be made

151
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:01,380

show wow

190
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:33,360

191
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,040
tried them all i didn't realize that

192
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,270
i'm the only person who's never tried

193
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:37,470
i've always looked to them by the

194
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:39,540
way when i bought them longingly cool

195
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:43,290
up was aghast oh really she because

196
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:46,830
she our amazon account is through her

197
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,480
emails so she gets all the receipts

198
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,710
for everything and she was like what

199
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:51,600
is this ah yeah that's it

200
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,770
i want to say that i mean

201
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:54,570
that's totally valid to be upset about

202
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:56,160
that yeah we made a case for

203
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,360
them that she didn't hear you know

204
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,860
so yeah it's true she wasn't ready

205
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:00,780
to shit but i i now i

206
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,280

00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:44,340
took a look at your feet maybe

311
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:46,020
we did or not but it's basically

312
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:48,090
radiation coming out of these horrible out

313
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:49,800
of the ground of of every buster

314
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,960

315
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,730
at that buster brown there was a

316
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:56,550
foot fetishist who managed the store and

317
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:58,170
they were sitting inside to these feet

318
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,370
they were just pictures of feet like

319
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:00,300

323
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:06,900
you need this type of and and

324
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:08,190
they told me i had very narrow

325
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:10,476

326
00:12:10,476 --> 00:12:12,450

nasty

339
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,230
boy ass

340
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,040
this goes on for quite a while

341
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,570
i've gotta save some of it so

342
00:12:51,594 --> 00:12:53,040
yeah see some of it the best

343
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,040
songs are listened to in installments twenty

344
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:56,430
seconds

345
00:12:57,570 --> 00:13:00,240
what are those um growing foods right

346
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,942
there what are those growing foods ah

347
00:13:04,184 --> 00:13:05,910
it is mysterious to me i don't

348
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:07,230
want to categorize it as fruit or

349
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:09,120
vegetable i can't see what you're looking

350
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,580
at prob well there's two rounds hanging

351
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:13,470
off of some tall six

352
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:16,200
oh those aren't fruit

353
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:20,700
and that's not my finger um i

354
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,050
don't know there's lemons over there that's

355
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:24,270
about an apple could be a tomato

356
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:25,650
neither one makes sense to me because

357
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:27,570
they're so tall and and high yeah

358
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:29,550
i have no idea um sounds like

359
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:32,678
me tall and high ah but i

360
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:33,960
can i say that i like the

361
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,910
straps in the back better yeah yeah

362
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:37,410
you can say that yeah see

363
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:40,230
i think with mine i don't want

364
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:41,220
to get a bigger i think i

365
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:43,350
mean maybe maybe they make crux narrow

366
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,110
so the problem for you is the

367
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,300
you're like banging around the sides yeah

368
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,500
but then my toe is in the

369
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,030
end and if i put the strap

370
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:53,070
on one then it's over because i

371
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:54,570
can't i have no room to really

372
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:56,460
move so do they make narrow crocs

a bit more nasty

460
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:47,700
but i think people are looking askance

461
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,350
at me i would think so

462
00:16:50,298 --> 00:16:51,537
this this

463
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,050

nasty is high and other people i

466
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,290
think it's probably

467
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:05,670
it's lesser people to ah i'm why

468
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:06,750

469
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:08,370
the end of the episode okay sure

00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:09,960
people can hear it uninterrupted sure thing

471
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:12,450
any of any fun funeral stories that

472
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:13,530
you've been a part of you know

473
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:15,090
what i was reminded of this the

474
00:17:15,090 --> 00:17:19,050
other day i was a i had

475
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:22,530
my first contemporary of mine

476
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:25,080
mine died this was in the ninety

477
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:27,000
s first like friend of mine that

478
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,970
died and i was asked to be

479
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:32,490
a pall bearer me and i frown

480
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:35,160
because of your name that's correct

481
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:37,230
it was all pulse

482
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:40,860
it was also my name's paul simon

483
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:42,690
when the grass single word it's like

484
00:17:42,690 --> 00:17:44,310
really heavy for a couple of people

485
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:45,870
because there's not enough pulse oh yeah

486
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:48,480
exactly all all poles of the same

487
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,440
height and this is what people don't

488
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,690
realize and that's why they're perfect to

489
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:53,520
be pallbearers can i of course mention

490
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,690
dance like in the meme

491
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,920
have you both been pallbearers before i

492
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:02,490
have yes i really um i don't

493
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:03,750
know what i mean it feels like

494
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:06,180
i'd be really hard emotionally but also

495
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:07,920
physically and also because it likes looking

496
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,450
at you lifting a thing and because

497
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:12,000
it's not a thing well i mean

498
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:14,400
you could probably like lift a dead

499
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,050
body with two people so

500
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:17,460
so to have so sounds like it's

501
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:19,200
that heavy it's more i feel like

502
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:23,460
it's it seems really um just emotionally

503
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:26,220
heavy it is and it's it's a

504
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:28,828
very but i think that because you

505
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:30,570
are focused so much on not fucking

506
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:32,910
up yeah that that aspect of it

507
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:35,520
ah is is put on hold for

508
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:35,850
a second

509
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,530
now will you be shocked to learn

510
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:39,840
there's more to my story why actually

511
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,120
i'm not shocked because i interrupted you

512
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,440
about one second into it

513
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:46,620
i kinda like it because i was

514
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:47,760
the center of the attention for the

515
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,186
future yeah apart you would like that

516
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:51,780
which you like being the center of

517
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:54,450
attention someone's dinner and afterwards at the

when people say hello to use a

521

00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,080
like i've heard it pronounced that way

558
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,520
maybe i did put it in my

559
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,770
mind that way because it's it supposedly

560
00:20:33,770 --> 00:20:36,140
his name as opposed to referring to

561
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:37,970
him as riff raff right i guess

562
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:39,770
i've always just made do they ever

563
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,150
call him riff raff in it or

564
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:41,600
does not

565
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:43,040
in it i i don't know if

566
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,060
i've ever heard it out loud you

567
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:46,160

00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:48,680
no but i could guess yeah go

569
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:52,130
ahead and guess okay um my first

570
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:53,720
guess is by the way this should

571
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,730
be an ongoing thing you know the

572
00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:57,200
whole it's got her talking about if

573
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,300
somebody doesn't know what the other people

574
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,520
are talking about you just guess yes

575
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:01,790
my

576
00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:04,130
first guess is that it's from fat

577
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:04,640
albert

578
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:10,310
yeah i mean i can't play guesses

579
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:12,440
go like nah i can't believe you

you up to dumb donald my next

584
00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:25,580
guess is that um donald it's frostbite

585
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:27,230
again with his right

586
00:21:28,910 --> 00:21:30,440
my next guess is that it's from

587
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:33,680
a rap group no that's that's good

588
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:35,240

hundred and family

591
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:43,040

592
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,350

i was fifteen ah my friend and

671
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:06,110
i were both very into these two

672
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:09,740
girls in our drama department and i

673
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:11,660
had a super huge crush

674
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:13,790
as autumn and they how can we

675
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:16,160
impress these girls no but i'm going

676
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,090
to wear black lipstick

677
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:20,180
they like to go to it so

678
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:21,320
i asked my parents if i could

679
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:23,810
go and they were like not satanic

680
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:25,640
they were like as long as there

681
00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:28,610
is violence and swearing but no sex

682
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,890
are there any abortions and but they

683
00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:32,101
also part of the problem was as

684
00:25:32,101 --> 00:25:33,470
it was starting a midnight i think

685
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:36,260
i'd want to clock curfews so there's

686
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:37,760
no way when i was fifteen that

687
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:38,300
was why

688
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:39,830
i am curfew is possible but on

689
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:41,870
the weekends i think it was so

690
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:45,350
ah so so i instead because they

691
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:47,330
like to go and i just really

692
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:49,580
wanted to spend time with her um

693
00:25:49,670 --> 00:25:51,950
instead i would sneak out my window

694
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:56,450
ah hey how's the weather up there

695
00:25:56,570 --> 00:25:58,460
oh and then

696
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:00,860
then then like there were all these

697
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:02,780
precautions that i had to take so

698
00:26:02,810 --> 00:26:04,280
so basically i do like open my

699
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:07,130
window punch out the screen that was

700
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:09,710
on it and then we didn't punch

701
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:11,330
it out but you know push it

702
00:26:11,432 --> 00:26:13,040
like i know roddy kick

703
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:16,550
master and then your one leg would

704
00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:18,830
fall out the window uv high crotch

705
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:21,050
for oil i would do a jumping

706
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:23,090
three sixty spin kick out the window

707
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,530
but then i would have to there

708
00:26:24,530 --> 00:26:26,150
was our our back gate i would

709
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:27,380
have to like lift up so it

710
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:29,480
would have silently you did knock that

711
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,500
out with my fist

712
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,380
karate chop it because it was good

713
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:36,830
and then my my friend who drove

714
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:38,510
me would have to park like four

715
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:40,550
doors down so i wouldn't get out

716
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:42,050
because my parents window was right on

717
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:44,630
the street their bedroom window yeah so

718
00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:46,190
i and then i would walk down

719
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:47,750
the street come back in and when

720
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:50,000
i would the the only issue was

721
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,740
putting the screen back on

722
00:26:51,781 --> 00:26:54,200
yes from the inside was really tough

723
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,760
there would always be a corner sticking

724
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,830
out so i would have to then

725
00:26:57,830 --> 00:26:59,660
the next day when i woke up

726
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:01,520
hope that my parents didn't see there

727
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,720
was a corner sticking out of the

728
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,580
screen how would they have seen that

729
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,950
because they're nosy so they would post

730
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:08,840
has been established as you can be

731
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,010
like they would have been like hey

732
00:27:10,010 --> 00:27:11,360
what's going on with this with the

733
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:11,900
screen

734
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:12,920
what is your scott we need to

735
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,960
talk about the screen corner yeah exact

736
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,750
stressful so they would have seen that

737
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:18,950
and then put it together and been

738
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:20,390
like oh you you went outside your

739
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:21,410
thing so the next day i would

740
00:27:21,410 --> 00:27:23,270
have to like make an excuse to

741
00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:25,070
take out the garbage or something which

742

888
00:33:08,365 --> 00:33:11,605
so he he used to have ah

889
00:33:11,635 --> 00:33:13,345
i think select tv or on tv

890
00:33:13,345 --> 00:33:14,635
i can't remember which one it was

891
00:33:14,665 --> 00:33:17,215
this was pre hbo ah it was

892
00:33:17,215 --> 00:33:19,795
like the first kind of premier movie

893
00:33:20,515 --> 00:33:21,715
ah thing that you could get at

894
00:33:21,715 --> 00:33:24,415
home where where you could ah but

895
00:33:24,415 --> 00:33:25,945
and this is previously ours and everything

896
00:33:25,945 --> 00:33:26,515
so it's basic

897
00:33:26,515 --> 00:33:27,445
early like a box you had to

898
00:33:27,445 --> 00:33:29,545
put on your tv it's pre tivo

899
00:33:29,605 --> 00:33:33,445
ah it's a pre pre can demand

900
00:33:33,445 --> 00:33:38,125
of ah definitely before cats um so

901
00:33:38,125 --> 00:33:39,415
he used to tape movies all the

902
00:33:39,415 --> 00:33:40,765
time and and we would watch him

903
00:33:40,765 --> 00:33:42,115
that's where i first saw bad news

904
00:33:42,115 --> 00:33:43,615
bears and all sorts of stuff but

905
00:33:43,615 --> 00:33:45,205
he i remember him saying he taped

906
00:33:45,205 --> 00:33:46,465
the rocky horror picture show and his

907
00:33:46,465 --> 00:33:46,675
only

908
00:33:46,675 --> 00:33:49,435
on once oh yes i did tell

909
00:33:49,435 --> 00:33:50,755
you i don't remember what happens but

910
00:33:50,755 --> 00:33:52,015
i remember a long time ago you

911
00:33:52,015 --> 00:33:53,545
telling me okay so he only it

912
00:33:53,545 --> 00:33:55,165
was only on once and it was

913
00:33:55,165 --> 00:33:56,965
a special event but and so he

914
00:33:56,965 --> 00:33:58,525
tape he taped this i guess it

915
00:33:58,525 --> 00:33:59,990
wasn't previously or because he could tape

916
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:02,485
things a special event yeah so they

917
00:34:02,485 --> 00:34:03,715
they it was like we're only gonna

918
00:34:03,715 --> 00:34:05,815

919
00:34:05,815 --> 00:34:06,835
whatever it's halloween

920
00:34:06,848 --> 00:34:08,815
mean and so he taped it and

921
00:34:08,815 --> 00:34:09,865

928
00:34:25,105 --> 00:34:26,763
i remember this oh bill

929
00:34:27,085 --> 00:34:30,475
with carol channing oh yeah he knew

930
00:34:30,925 --> 00:34:34,189
yeah and then he would just tape

931
00:34:34,189 --> 00:34:35,305
things that he thought i would like

932
00:34:35,305 --> 00:34:36,535
and then i would get the the

933
00:34:36,925 --> 00:34:37,945
v h s and it was so

934
00:34:38,035 --> 00:34:40,018
cool cause i didn't have hbo and

935
00:34:40,018 --> 00:34:42,685
the suis yeah we didn't have a

936
00:34:42,685 --> 00:34:44,215
vcr so we had to go over

937
00:34:44,215 --> 00:34:45,475
to his house to watch the stuff

938
00:34:45,475 --> 00:34:47,065
so and then my parents wouldn't let

939
00:34:47,065 --> 00:34:47,155
me

940
00:34:47,185 --> 00:34:48,835
watch rocky horror picture show but i

941
00:34:48,835 --> 00:34:49,825
filed it in the back of my

942
00:34:49,825 --> 00:34:51,505
mind that he had taped it so

943
00:34:51,505 --> 00:34:54,625
when i was seventeen or sixteen maybe

944
00:34:54,685 --> 00:34:58,675
but i was sixteen my uncle taped

945
00:34:58,675 --> 00:34:59,035
the rug

946
00:35:00,145 --> 00:35:01,705
oh did your parents care what you

947
00:35:01,705 --> 00:35:04,795
watched no they weren't the only time

948
00:35:04,825 --> 00:35:05,935
i think i've said this before the

949
00:35:05,935 --> 00:35:08,275
only time they ever my mother ever

950
00:35:08,275 --> 00:35:09,625
gave a restriction on something we could

951
00:35:09,625 --> 00:35:11,365
watch was my brothers and i wanted

952
00:35:11,365 --> 00:35:12,685
to watch psycho and she wouldn't let

953
00:35:12,685 --> 00:35:14,875
us watch it now one sounds like

954
00:35:14,875 --> 00:35:16,075
it's going to be a little much

955
00:35:16,255 --> 00:35:18,715
so i mean just from the title

956
00:35:19,167 --> 00:35:20,275
like zoo

957
00:35:20,365 --> 00:35:21,175
yes leica

958
00:35:24,775 --> 00:35:26,493
so that's where we get that phrase

959
00:35:26,545 --> 00:35:29,545
just everyone knows jacinda there is no

960
00:35:29,545 --> 00:35:31,495
such thing as psychotic before that movie

961
00:35:31,825 --> 00:35:33,175
and now that is where and that's

962
00:35:33,175 --> 00:35:34,645
where we get that phrase i feel

963
00:35:34,645 --> 00:35:36,505
like the movie made psychotic i do

964
00:35:36,625 --> 00:35:38,245
wonder though like it made it easy

965
00:35:38,245 --> 00:35:40,495
to say did was it the first

966
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:41,755
and so people like i'm gonna be

967
00:35:41,755 --> 00:35:42,055
that

968
00:35:42,655 --> 00:35:43,945
was it the first thing that took

969
00:35:43,945 --> 00:35:45,205
the tick off

970
00:35:46,465 --> 00:35:50,005
i beg your pardon what psychotic when

971
00:35:50,005 --> 00:35:51,205
you mean to the attic

972
00:35:52,555 --> 00:35:53,455
you know what i mean it's the

973
00:35:53,485 --> 00:35:56,095
oddest thing that tick tick tick yeah

974
00:35:56,215 --> 00:35:57,385
yeah so they it was at the

975
00:35:57,385 --> 00:35:59,785
first but where on the popular culture

976
00:35:59,785 --> 00:36:01,915
to shorten psychotic to psycho what are

977
00:36:01,915 --> 00:36:04,975
other things that have tick or you're

978
00:36:04,975 --> 00:36:07,705
just saying that var tick oh well

979
00:36:07,735 --> 00:36:09,565
you hide under there was it the

980
00:36:09,565 --> 00:36:12,565
first thing that ever taught me something

981
00:36:12,625 --> 00:36:14,245
oh that's psychotic love it and i

982
00:36:14,245 --> 00:36:17,095
was kidding but i do i don't

983
00:36:17,095 --> 00:36:18,805
think so i feel like psycho had

984
00:36:18,805 --> 00:36:20,305
to be a word before that maybe

985
00:36:20,335 --> 00:36:23,275

they learned how to do ah barbershop

1076
00:40:31,435 --> 00:40:33,325
harmonies we taught them how to do

1077
00:40:33,325 --> 00:40:35,545
that and to practice they would walk

1078
00:40:35,545 --> 00:40:38,275
around school together and only respond in

1079
00:40:38,275 --> 00:40:40,735
barbershop harmony away to anyone i don't

1080
00:40:40,735 --> 00:40:42,805

and that's how

1082
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,730

learned did the same thing they've learned

1088
00:40:58,730 --> 00:41:01,070
how to do barbershop harmonies in order

1089
00:41:01,070 --> 00:41:03,050
to do their complex harmonies for the

1090
00:41:03,050 --> 00:41:04,160
songs it made

1091
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:05,690
made me want to start a barbershop

1092
00:41:05,690 --> 00:41:07,366

1110
00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:38,390
yeah let's do it let's figure out

1111
00:41:38,390 --> 00:41:40,040
how to do barbershop quartet and walk

1112
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:42,260
around like argo just doing barbershop courts

1113
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:44,270
editing all the time let's be like

1114
00:41:44,270 --> 00:41:46,640
these four actually from my high school

1115
00:41:47,090 --> 00:41:50,000
from approximately nineteen eighty one and probably

1116
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:51,770
when they did that what an absurd

1117
00:41:51,770 --> 00:41:53,960
story and then to share it like

1118
00:41:54,230 --> 00:41:55,460
this is the kind of thing you

1119
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:56,000
should be doing

1120
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,250
seeing is inflicting this on other people

1121
00:41:58,790 --> 00:42:00,890
although otherwise you're not dedicated is what

1122
00:42:00,890 --> 00:42:02,210
makes it absurd is it the fact

1123
00:42:02,210 --> 00:42:04,700
that they were fourteen fifteen years old

1124
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:07,220
because if yes like christian bale were

1125
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:09,050
to do it whatever yeah i think

1126
00:42:09,050 --> 00:42:09,830
he's absurd too

1127
00:42:11,210 --> 00:42:12,920
ah yes now i want the secrets

1128
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:15,770

oh i always can i tell you

1291
00:49:10,850 --> 00:49:15,080
this i apropos of the christmas season

1292
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:21,110
depictions of santa claus on commercials for

1293
00:49:21,140 --> 00:49:24,470
adult things like cars stuff like okay

1294
00:49:24,830 --> 00:49:27,290
drives me fucking i hate because it's

1295
00:49:27,290 --> 00:49:28,880
juvenile so when you see like

1296
00:49:28,910 --> 00:49:31,220
santa giving someone a cossack cute it's

1297
00:49:31,220 --> 00:49:34,400
not funny but to think that maybe

1298
00:49:34,460 --> 00:49:36,500
just maybe if you opened your heart

1299
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:39,050
a little bit you could see that

1300
00:49:39,050 --> 00:49:40,850
those commercials are also for kids

1301
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:43,670
you think a car commercial is for

1302
00:49:43,670 --> 00:49:45,140
a kid they might be watching tv

1303
00:49:45,380 --> 00:49:47,330
and it just readers have already sent

1304
00:49:47,330 --> 00:49:49,010
a job whatever way you think a

1305
00:49:49,016 --> 00:49:50,810
commercials for whomever watches it

1306
00:49:52,262 --> 00:49:53,930
he might be watching tv but it

1307
00:49:53,930 --> 00:49:56,060
reinforces the idea that santos real

1308
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:01,280
yeah okay gives me that reinforce wait

1309
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:03,080
so you think you think a car

1310
00:50:03,710 --> 00:50:06,650
company there they want to sell they

1311
00:50:06,650 --> 00:50:08,000
want to sell it you'll take sar

1312
00:50:08,060 --> 00:50:10,970
g several different actors playing santa claus

1313
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:14,570
but they have a responsibility to children

1314
00:50:15,020 --> 00:50:16,670
i think as a kid i didn't

1315
00:50:16,670 --> 00:50:17,360
even conceive

1316
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:19,610
order them looking different like i didn't

1317
00:50:19,610 --> 00:50:21,110
care that there were all these different

1318
00:50:21,110 --> 00:50:22,640
looking so because i always knew that

1319
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:24,740
people in commercials were actors it's like

1320
00:50:24,740 --> 00:50:26,630
no no that's like an actor playing

1321
00:50:26,630 --> 00:50:28,490
santa but he's one of surreal setups

1322
00:50:28,490 --> 00:50:29,960
the real set is he wouldn't do

1323
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:31,730
this but like if i went to

1324
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:34,130
see santa at the mall

1325
00:50:35,390 --> 00:50:37,070
i don't i never considered he looks

1326
00:50:37,070 --> 00:50:38,978
different than the other sigh always cause

1327
00:50:38,978 --> 00:50:39,890
it was right oh yeah i don't

1328
00:50:39,890 --> 00:50:41,360
think i thought that i always knew

1329
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:42,980
that that was a guy playing santa

1330
00:50:44,090 --> 00:50:46,520
you know i can't remember if i

1331
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:47,900
knew yeah maybe i don't i just

1332
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:50,150
don't know i believed in santa i

1333
00:50:50,150 --> 00:50:52,000
think but i always knew

1334
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:56,300

1367
00:51:56,870 --> 00:52:00,020
responses what's your lead time on tweets

1368
00:52:00,140 --> 00:52:01,640
seems to be about six hours i

1369
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:03,320
plan all my tweets twenty four hours

1370
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:04,940
events okay so i'm gonna try my

1371
00:52:04,940 --> 00:52:07,610
hand first and draw the gif yes

1372
00:52:07,610 --> 00:52:09,650
i say draw the frames of the

1373
00:52:09,650 --> 00:52:09,980
gif

1374
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:14,960
um the herridge twitter would be deleted

1375
00:52:15,140 --> 00:52:17,570
yes i mean it would be great

1376
00:52:17,570 --> 00:52:19,190
to have it taken off of my

1377
00:52:19,190 --> 00:52:21,020
hands i want someone to take i'm

1378
00:52:21,020 --> 00:52:22,490
not gonna do us yeah no no

1379
00:52:22,490 --> 00:52:23,630
no i'm not going do yeah yeah

1380
00:52:23,750 --> 00:52:24,590
i think it would be a blessing

1381
00:52:25,130 --> 00:52:28,700
anyway um parents who they just don't

1382
00:52:28,700 --> 00:52:31,190
understand who won't tell their kids about

1383
00:52:31,190 --> 00:52:32,960
at santa claus because they they don't

1384
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:34,370
like the idea of lying to their

1385
00:52:34,370 --> 00:52:36,500
children oh yeah right i want to

1386
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:39,170
know are there people that felt this

1387
00:52:39,170 --> 00:52:41,870
way and then realize like um overthinking

1388
00:52:41,870 --> 00:52:43,970
this this is like a magical thing

1389
00:52:43,970 --> 00:52:46,190
that i'm taking away from my trying

1390
00:52:46,220 --> 00:52:48,650
to do something magical i think yes

1391
00:52:48,650 --> 00:52:49,730
even as a kid like i believe

1392
00:52:49,730 --> 00:52:51,290
dueling ferries and things like it

1393
00:52:51,350 --> 00:52:52,580
it's fun like it doesn't have to

1394
00:52:52,580 --> 00:52:54,230
be that serious yeah it's not you're

1395
00:52:54,230 --> 00:52:56,660
not want the idea of stretching that

1396
00:52:56,660 --> 00:52:58,790
to be lying to your job yeah

1397
00:52:59,095 --> 00:53:01,520
so extreme i do remember being five

1398
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:04,790
or six and i think my parents

1399
00:53:04,790 --> 00:53:07,790
let it slip that that santa wasn't

1400
00:53:07,790 --> 00:53:09,020
real or something and i was like

1401
00:53:09,020 --> 00:53:11,150
you've been lying to me and then

1402
00:53:11,150 --> 00:53:11,510
within

1403
00:53:11,510 --> 00:53:12,830
in two seconds i think i got

1404
00:53:12,830 --> 00:53:14,030
over it yeah because you still get

1405
00:53:14,030 --> 00:53:15,523
a ton of presence yeah and the

1406
00:53:15,523 --> 00:53:16,640
same thing with the two ferry i

1407
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:18,350
knew the tooth fairy wasn't real but

1408
00:53:18,380 --> 00:53:20,630
still i wanted those quarters on what

1409
00:53:20,630 --> 00:53:23,090
those quarters i want today pull my

1410
00:53:23,090 --> 00:53:23,390
teeth

1411
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:27,260
i think it's complicated when you have

1412
00:53:27,740 --> 00:53:30,980
parents who are one is jewish and

1413
00:53:30,980 --> 00:53:34,130
one is one celebrates christmas because then

1414
00:53:34,130 --> 00:53:36,050
you kind of have that conflicting energy

1415
00:53:36,050 --> 00:53:38,390
of like what do we go with

1416
00:53:38,390 --> 00:53:40,310
here right well i if if it

1417
00:53:40,310 --> 00:53:41,510
were me i would go with both

1418
00:53:41,510 --> 00:53:43,460
foreshore yeah mo don't use people to

1419
00:53:43,460 --> 00:53:44,630
go away it's just great we get

1420
00:53:44,630 --> 00:53:44,870
the best

1421
00:53:44,870 --> 00:53:46,760
asked both well yeah but then maybe

1422
00:53:47,270 --> 00:53:49,160
ah no i think a lot of

1423
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:50,540
people do that but i think the

1424
00:53:50,780 --> 00:53:53,660
decision to full force go with santa

1425
00:53:53,660 --> 00:53:56,270
as a thing is complicated i do

1426
00:53:56,270 --> 00:53:57,920
think it's i have a cousin that

1427
00:53:57,980 --> 00:54:01,610
converted to judaism we hope scott berkeley's

1428
00:54:02,150 --> 00:54:04,100
do you think that's more complex than

1429
00:54:04,220 --> 00:54:05,030
explaining the birth

1430
00:54:05,060 --> 00:54:05,660
of christ

1431
00:54:06,740 --> 00:54:07,610
i mean

1432
00:54:08,660 --> 00:54:11,060
you're saying so what are the rules

1433
00:54:11,060 --> 00:54:12,830
with santa yeah jewish people have enough

1434
00:54:12,830 --> 00:54:16,070
other things to explain well no i'm

1435
00:54:16,070 --> 00:54:18,320
saying that it's santa is like a

1436
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:20,810
fun magical thing yeah as opposed to

1437
00:54:20,810 --> 00:54:23,630
getting into the the the the differences

1438
00:54:23,630 --> 00:54:25,850
between religion actual reason for the holiday

1439
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:28,220
right which is that this person was

1440
00:54:28,220 --> 00:54:28,760
born to be this

1441
00:54:28,790 --> 00:54:30,477
savior of mankind well i feel i

1442
00:54:30,477 --> 00:54:31,970
feel like i being raised in a

1443
00:54:31,970 --> 00:54:35,330
religious household like there were concurrent tracks

1444
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:38,330
like the whole santa thing was being

1445
00:54:38,330 --> 00:54:40,790
explained concurrently along with like but the

1446
00:54:40,790 --> 00:54:42,830
real reason for the for this yes

1447
00:54:42,830 --> 00:54:44,450
we yeah we had a manger and

1448
00:54:44,450 --> 00:54:46,820
to the point where i i bought

1449
00:54:46,820 --> 00:54:48,590
a manger for our house even though

1450
00:54:48,590 --> 00:54:48,920
i'm not

1451
00:54:48,950 --> 00:54:50,900
religious anymore i just like having it

1452
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:52,340
at christmas time yeah so we have

1453
00:54:52,340 --> 00:54:53,990
an activity scene or some people say

1454
00:54:54,140 --> 00:54:58,370
natively seen some people say natasha vt

1455
00:54:58,842 --> 00:55:01,520
who did the tea but i think

1456
00:55:01,820 --> 00:55:03,020
i'm a tie i think it would

1457
00:55:03,020 --> 00:55:05,060
be so hard to try to yeah

1458
00:55:05,150 --> 00:55:08,510
converts to another religion i know that

1459
00:55:08,540 --> 00:55:09,110
some people

1460
00:55:09,110 --> 00:55:11,540
i'll do it just simply because like

1461
00:55:11,540 --> 00:55:14,720
i'm marrying someone and they they cannot

1462
00:55:14,750 --> 00:55:17,090
like they are so religious they cannot

1463
00:55:17,090 --> 00:55:18,920
marry someone of another religion and so

1464
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:20,750
his kiker name so i converted you

1465
00:55:20,750 --> 00:55:21,860
know but i just think it would

1466
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:23,930
be so hard it seems like would

1467
00:55:23,930 --> 00:55:26,360
you ever really if you were to

1468
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:27,440
be the one converting it would you

1469
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:29,270
ever really believe in the other thing

1470
00:55:29,300 --> 00:55:31,100
that's hard and i think some people

1471
00:55:31,100 --> 00:55:32,300
really do when they get hurt but

1472
00:55:32,300 --> 00:55:34,070
i think when you're converting for a

1473
00:55:34,070 --> 00:55:36,590
relationship that's less likely that you're like

1474
00:55:36,590 --> 00:55:39,860
fully believing all of the right stuff

1475
00:55:39,890 --> 00:55:41,180
i mean maybe there are some people

1476
00:55:41,180 --> 00:55:42,410
who are like ooh this is a

1477
00:55:42,410 --> 00:55:44,300

for even michael doe we want to

1596
00:59:56,120 --> 00:59:59,330
play your big o angle wow in

1597
00:59:59,330 --> 01:00:01,850
a bid basically to play is that

1598
01:00:01,850 --> 01:00:03,530
how you get parts is bidding

1599
01:00:04,730 --> 01:00:06,410
yes you may put in five dollars

1600
01:00:06,770 --> 01:00:08,210
that was the beginning of ebay george

1601
01:00:08,210 --> 01:00:09,980
lucas was like what's to be in

1602
01:00:09,980 --> 01:00:11,870
my movie but yeah he asked he

1603
01:00:11,870 --> 01:00:13,220
really wanted to be larger beings and

1604
01:00:13,220 --> 01:00:14,360
then it didn't go his way but

1605
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:16,970
that was how he found out wow

1606
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,280
oh and that's saying that so that's

1607
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:21,740
why george looser reduced the movie hadn't

1608
01:00:21,740 --> 01:00:23,000
come out you know and that's why

1609
01:00:23,030 --> 01:00:24,710
george lucas introduced him as

1610
01:00:24,710 --> 01:00:26,210
as jar jar because he was just

1611
01:00:26,210 --> 01:00:28,400
trying to break it to michael this

1612
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:29,570
is this is the perfect way to

1613
01:00:29,570 --> 01:00:31,070
break this to someone instead of just

1614
01:00:31,070 --> 01:00:32,810
writing the email perfect they've just done

1615
01:00:32,810 --> 01:00:33,590
a concert

1616
01:00:35,330 --> 01:00:37,070
oh or maybe he was trying to

1617
01:00:37,070 --> 01:00:38,149
see what his reaction would be and

1618
01:00:38,149 --> 01:00:39,770
it wasn't supposed to be so it's

1619
01:00:39,770 --> 01:00:41,450

1662
01:02:15,305 --> 01:02:17,166
that he got kelsey grammer to play

1663
01:02:17,166 --> 01:02:17,315

1664
01:02:18,515 --> 01:02:19,775

1665
01:02:20,795 --> 01:02:22,325
a guy who like could not be

1666
01:02:22,325 --> 01:02:23,255
more sedentary

1667
01:02:24,785 --> 01:02:26,555
he played beast in an x-men movie

1668
01:02:26,555 --> 01:02:27,515
so he was you're not going to

1669
01:02:27,575 --> 01:02:29,465
early you to eat no spoilers because

1670
01:02:29,465 --> 01:02:31,415
you might watch these guys any blue

1671
01:02:31,415 --> 01:02:33,485
are sometimes covered in fur and that's

1672
01:02:33,485 --> 01:02:34,475
the last straw for you

1673
01:02:36,065 --> 01:02:37,625
i don't wanna see frasier blue

1674
01:02:39,455 --> 01:02:43,175
ah yea the fluid is back um

1675
01:02:43,295 --> 01:02:46,115
okay and across the conversation scott polo

1676
01:02:46,115 --> 01:02:48,095
lauren make a sentence by trading off

1677
01:02:48,155 --> 01:02:50,345
adding one word at a time and

1678
01:02:50,345 --> 01:02:51,635
the word must start with the next

1679
01:02:51,635 --> 01:02:54,215
letter from the host's name in order

1680
01:02:54,515 --> 01:02:56,525
example of a game than a scott

1681
01:02:56,555 --> 01:02:58,985
paul lauren order someone please lie

1682
01:02:58,985 --> 01:03:01,325
let cats ask all of us unusual

1683
01:03:01,325 --> 01:03:04,535
tricks like reading tales every night wow

1684
01:03:04,775 --> 01:03:07,565
great so we who were gonna pick

1685
01:03:07,565 --> 01:03:10,235
our own names for this first one

1686
01:03:10,355 --> 01:03:14,705
and ah i shouldn't start because we've

1687
01:03:14,825 --> 01:03:17,705
we when that example started with me

1688
01:03:17,705 --> 01:03:19,115
and then when we were practicing

1689
01:03:19,145 --> 01:03:20,495
this during the break we also started

1690
01:03:20,495 --> 01:03:22,145
with me so i feel like why

1691
01:03:22,145 --> 01:03:23,165
don't we say you started with the

1692
01:03:23,165 --> 01:03:25,325
same word yeah exactly so why don't

1693
01:03:25,325 --> 01:03:27,095
we start with you paul okay and

1694
01:03:27,095 --> 01:03:28,805
that'll mix it up a little and

1695
01:03:28,805 --> 01:03:31,175
ah basically what happens we just go

1696
01:03:31,175 --> 01:03:33,305
until someone fucks up or we run

1697
01:03:33,305 --> 01:03:36,245
out of better grammatically incorrect or with

1698
01:03:36,245 --> 01:03:38,495
bill maher yeah i guess don't do

1699
01:03:38,495 --> 01:03:39,305
either watching them

1700
01:03:40,625 --> 01:03:42,425
okay doesn't make sense for some reason

1701
01:03:42,455 --> 01:03:42,935
okay great

1702
01:03:44,375 --> 01:03:46,805
alright let's start with paw my name

1703
01:03:46,805 --> 01:03:48,455
is maria by the way we are

1704
01:03:48,455 --> 01:03:50,585
using the f we just we decided

1705
01:03:50,585 --> 01:03:53,105
this yes whatever are we're not going

1706
01:03:53,105 --> 01:03:55,025
to use our middle initials because those

1707
01:03:55,025 --> 01:03:56,975
aren't our stage names that's not how

1708
01:03:56,975 --> 01:03:59,585
we're listed on mdp that's right it's

1709
01:03:59,585 --> 01:04:02,285
however you're listed on mtb yes we're

1710
01:04:02,285 --> 01:04:03,785
not using the sometimes cry

1711
01:04:03,785 --> 01:04:05,795
edit it as because that's a misspelling

1712
01:04:06,485 --> 01:04:06,995
all right

1713
01:04:09,065 --> 01:04:11,555
here we go practically

1714
01:04:17,075 --> 01:04:19,355
an oren is just the worst word

1715
01:04:19,355 --> 01:04:21,515
i could have started with losing

1716
01:04:23,195 --> 01:04:23,855
soccer

1717
01:04:26,885 --> 01:04:27,365
and

1718
01:04:30,035 --> 01:04:30,695
also

1719
01:04:32,915 --> 01:04:34,625
contriving what

1720
01:04:39,395 --> 01:04:41,255
we know this doesn't make sense it

1721
01:04:41,285 --> 01:04:44,855
does so kind of does practically practically

1722
01:04:44,855 --> 01:04:48,395
losing soccer and also contriving and also

1723
01:04:48,395 --> 01:04:50,825
contriving under

1724
01:04:54,245 --> 01:04:55,175
unseen

1725
01:04:56,675 --> 01:04:57,545
orthodox

1726
01:05:00,335 --> 01:05:01,145
likely

1727
01:05:03,845 --> 01:05:06,005
okay now now i think we've lost

1728
01:05:06,005 --> 01:05:07,775
it because i mean oh we lost

1729
01:05:07,775 --> 01:05:10,205
it unlikely i think the fine transitional

1730
01:05:10,205 --> 01:05:10,985
radically

1731
01:05:12,995 --> 01:05:16,775
losing soccer and also contriving what you

1732
01:05:16,955 --> 01:05:19,175
want also contrived gun scene

1733
01:05:20,405 --> 01:05:23,135
under something under unseen it doesn't make

1734
01:05:23,135 --> 01:05:23,291
any

1735
01:05:24,545 --> 01:05:26,795
not yet not yet can we pull

1736
01:05:26,795 --> 01:05:28,356
it out you can't say it since

1737
01:05:28,356 --> 01:05:29,885
it doesn't make sense until the end

1738
01:05:30,485 --> 01:05:31,025
okay

1739
01:05:32,255 --> 01:05:36,425
