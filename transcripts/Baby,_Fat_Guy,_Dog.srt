45
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,180
and then i wonder like oh if

year above him i feel like and

53

they were so close i was just

55
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:03,060
like how does this happen i thought

56
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:05,280
that you hated everyone that you were

57
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,300
in forced to be in a house

58
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,400

00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,310
pals in that way although my my

63
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:20,310

64
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,500

of course i can't go but i

71
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:36,480
always think what if i could the

72
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,190
dynamics between people who have a lot

73
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:40,470
of siblings like the ways some are

74
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,870
close in some aren't and um i

75
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:44,760
have a friend who has a sister

76
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,590
and a brother and she's not close

77
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:47,850
with the brother at all and he's

78
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:48,990
not really close with the family at

79
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:50,460
all but then she's close with close

80
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:51,120
with her sister

81
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,290

very close we went all through school

201
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,614
together and we at one point were

202
00:06:56,615 --> 00:06:58,320
the same age yeah we're this image

203
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:00,180
and we tried to do a code

204
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:01,650
or your tap on the wall to

205
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:03,570
each other because our bedrooms shared a

206
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:05,550
wall wait so these these were attached

207
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:07,200
as a duplex oh suplex smart

208
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:08,881

209
00:07:08,881 --> 00:07:10,890

who's that samantha bit don't say feckless

212
00:07:17,707 --> 00:07:19,140
said my huh

213
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,530
so we set up this this code

214
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:25,530
which was essentially to say thanks no

215
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:26,850
i'm just like imagining what the code

216
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:28,200
is what is it oh the code

217
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:28,830
was

218
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:33,180
basically it's not well thought out it

219
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:35,940
was one tap for every

220
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:39,174
for every letter of the alphabet yes

221
00:07:39,174 --> 00:07:41,040
so when he say it was v

222
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:43,650
yeah exactly oh my god exactly we

223
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:45,060
didn't do this didn't last very long

224
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:47,580
and also i was using a hammer

225
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:49,590
to do the tab and i hammered

226
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:52,200
a hole in the wall ah great

227
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,370
that's what this and then i supposed

228
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:55,500
to do yeah and what how did

229
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,580
you explain the hole in the wall

230
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:59,790
i didn't know i hit it i

231
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:03,060
hit it with clothing what was in

232
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:05,580
the closet oh so oh okay okay

233
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:07,050
okay yeah i was like i imagined

234
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:08,760
you like hey your pajamas over it

235
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,120
every day

236
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:12,870
i dressed it up like a person

237
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,540
i love you my roommates it has

238
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:18,240
a mouth yeah shared a room we

239
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,910
yes we shared rooms for um in

240
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:23,760
various combinations over the years i always

241
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:25,410
exciting when you switch your with someone

242
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:28,230
else yes it was well what basically

243
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:29,280
what would happen just one person would

244
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,900
leave like so yeah yeah so as

245
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,130
people were growing up and moving out

246
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:33,540
of the house some some people would

247
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:34,080
be teenagers

248
00:08:34,135 --> 00:08:36,235
and would need more space or something

249
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:37,890
with a wow or spi it was

250
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:39,240
like the older you got the more

251
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,830
likely you were to get more space

252
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:42,900
so right at one point i think

253
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:45,720
maybe two of my sisters were sharing

254
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,400
a room and one had a room

255
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,290
to herself on the third floor and

256
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:51,360
then no it wouldn't have been it

257
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,340
would have been maybe maybe they each

258
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:54,930
had their own bedroom the girls each

259
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:57,270
other own bedroom and then because i

260
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:59,520
remember there being a parish where know

261
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,780
where my brothers and i were all

262
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:02,430

430
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:08,370
impressionist and it was the only person

431
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:09,900
i saw do a great version of

did like dip the typical people than

435
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:18,570
you would expect william hurt is the

436
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:19,650
only person

437
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:20,940

neck

443
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:33,270

670
00:23:43,835 --> 00:23:46,055
walk down every single io no matter

671
00:23:46,055 --> 00:23:49,265
what of course we have there's a

672
00:23:49,295 --> 00:23:52,295
grocery store chain small chain and we

673
00:23:52,295 --> 00:23:53,675
moved from

674
00:23:53,705 --> 00:23:55,385
a neighborhood where we went to this

675
00:23:55,385 --> 00:23:57,545
one to a neighbourhood where we go

676
00:23:57,545 --> 00:23:59,315
to another in the same chain but

677
00:24:00,305 --> 00:24:03,275
everything is lightly lightly different and drives

678
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:05,375
you crazy fucking i feel like i

679
00:24:05,375 --> 00:24:07,115
finally got a handle on it yeah

680
00:24:07,145 --> 00:24:08,585
because i still go to both because

681
00:24:08,585 --> 00:24:10,685
the one is near the usb and

682
00:24:10,685 --> 00:24:12,095
so i'm there i end up there

683
00:24:12,095 --> 00:24:13,655
a lot and um

684
00:24:14,195 --> 00:24:17,105
it's just different enough to be maddening

685
00:24:17,135 --> 00:24:18,155
yeah but i feel like i've finally

686
00:24:18,155 --> 00:24:19,235
got a handle i like going to

687
00:24:19,415 --> 00:24:21,755
different grocery stores to see the differences

688
00:24:21,755 --> 00:24:23,645
and to see certain products that you

689
00:24:23,645 --> 00:24:25,475
would never yeah get to see it's

690
00:24:25,475 --> 00:24:26,465
what i used to like about going

691
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:27,935
to different record stores is like oh

692
00:24:27,935 --> 00:24:30,065
shit they they ordered because once i

693
00:24:30,065 --> 00:24:31,805
have round records so now once you

694
00:24:31,805 --> 00:24:33,995
figure out like pop chips i don't

695
00:24:34,025 --> 00:24:36,365
even know what at what age i

696
00:24:36,365 --> 00:24:41,375
realized how stores worked of the people

697
00:24:41,375 --> 00:24:45,035
who own the store order things and

698
00:24:45,215 --> 00:24:46,805
the things are brought like i guess

699
00:24:46,925 --> 00:24:48,965
what your journey with retails amazing because

700
00:24:48,965 --> 00:24:50,645
i remember when you figured out you

701
00:24:50,645 --> 00:24:52,295
could order a sandwich at a deli

702
00:24:53,165 --> 00:24:54,065
yes like what

703
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,345
i was doing i was six yes

704
00:24:56,645 --> 00:24:58,595
no but but here's what i mean

705
00:24:58,625 --> 00:24:59,945
like i was once in a record

706
00:24:59,945 --> 00:25:03,137
store and i assume i guess i

707
00:25:03,137 --> 00:25:04,415
had just assumed like they had all

708
00:25:04,415 --> 00:25:06,035
the records and if they didn't have

709
00:25:06,035 --> 00:25:08,885
something because someone bought it right and

710
00:25:08,885 --> 00:25:11,045
then and then i asked the store

711
00:25:11,045 --> 00:25:12,485
hey do you have this album and

712
00:25:12,485 --> 00:25:13,655
they're like no but we could order

713
00:25:13,655 --> 00:25:14,315
it for you and

714
00:25:14,345 --> 00:25:15,725
i was like what what does that

715
00:25:15,725 --> 00:25:17,135
mean they're like yeah just tell me

716
00:25:17,135 --> 00:25:18,395
where it is getting the serial number

717
00:25:18,395 --> 00:25:20,015
on it and like well order it

718
00:25:20,015 --> 00:25:21,005
and it'll be here for you and

719
00:25:21,005 --> 00:25:22,115
a few weeks i was like how

720
00:25:22,115 --> 00:25:23,735
did really and then it sort of

721
00:25:23,735 --> 00:25:25,235
dawns on you like okay if you

722
00:25:25,235 --> 00:25:26,915
go to the grocery store like all

723
00:25:26,915 --> 00:25:29,645
ralph's don't have the exact same things

724
00:25:29,675 --> 00:25:32,735
yeah they make decisions based on how

725
00:25:32,735 --> 00:25:33,875
much space they have in the store

726
00:25:33,875 --> 00:25:34,475
of like oh we're gonna

727
00:25:34,505 --> 00:25:35,915
order that so i guess i would

728
00:25:35,915 --> 00:25:36,785
i'm trying to say is i like

729
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:39,035
going to different stores to see like

730
00:25:39,095 --> 00:25:40,475
oh shit i've never even heard of

731
00:25:40,475 --> 00:25:42,545
this type of time or this type

732
00:25:42,545 --> 00:25:43,865
of chip or whatever but at the

733
00:25:43,865 --> 00:25:45,755
same time i don't really like i

734
00:25:45,755 --> 00:25:47,915
find it very frustrating being in grocery

735
00:25:47,915 --> 00:25:49,355
stores and trying to find stuff can

736
00:25:49,355 --> 00:25:50,855
i tell you a secret i like

737
00:25:50,855 --> 00:25:53,555
the lita cheese ooh and i noticed

738
00:25:53,555 --> 00:25:54,455
that the one

739
00:25:55,205 --> 00:25:57,335
garrisons that we used to go to

740
00:25:57,815 --> 00:25:59,585
has velveeta cheese but the one we

932
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:57,000
it's like an animal because with an

933
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,220
animal you can't gain consent it's not

934
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:01,680
an animal no but it can't talk

935
00:33:02,010 --> 00:33:03,749
you didn't talk he could tell he'd

936
00:33:03,749 --> 00:33:06,360

00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,020
what you're saying because he can't talk

940
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,630
he could talk before he could talk

941
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:14,190
oh so there's a cut-off if you

942
00:33:14,190 --> 00:33:15,930

never have sex because we don't know

948
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,860
if if they're actually giving consent guess

949
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:30,270

jobs were like this and and i

1288
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:58,310
came to realize just the managers were

1289
00:44:58,310 --> 00:44:59,990
insane or whatever but they would at

1290
00:44:59,990 --> 00:45:00,800
the end of the night they'd be

1291
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:02,600
like okay who wants to take what

1292
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:03,710
home and i would take home like

1300
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:21,590

00:50:28,490 --> 00:50:31,940
tow car nilly starts the game by

1464
00:50:31,940 --> 00:50:33,350
pointing to one of the players saying

00:50:35,780 --> 00:50:37,160
player must continue the game by saying

1467
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:39,109
a title himself which must connect to

1468
00:50:39,109 --> 00:50:40,550
the previous title in some way so

1469
00:50:40,550 --> 00:50:42,230
just having a word in common the

1470
00:50:42,230 --> 00:50:43,820
time machine time enough for love

1471
00:50:44,655 --> 00:50:47,985
common creator and author as with hamlet

1472
00:50:48,045 --> 00:50:50,648
or macbeth or an actor or producer

1473
00:50:50,685 --> 00:50:53,085
direct so what you're saying i'm already

1474
00:50:53,085 --> 00:50:55,335
bored with this wait wait when do

1475
00:50:55,335 --> 00:50:56,745
we get to say cornell e wait

1476
00:50:56,745 --> 00:50:59,655
what so it's like the movie title

1477
00:50:59,655 --> 00:51:01,485
game as you say a title and

1478
00:51:01,485 --> 00:51:02,505
then it has i have to say

1479
00:51:02,505 --> 00:51:04,359
something that yeah why

1480
00:51:04,875 --> 00:51:06,494
connected in some way either by a

1481
00:51:06,494 --> 00:51:09,645
word or by a person the other

1482
00:51:09,645 --> 00:51:10,785
part is why does there have to

1483
00:51:10,785 --> 00:51:12,405
be a cornell master who gives one

1484
00:51:12,405 --> 00:51:14,055
title and then points at someone and

1485
00:51:14,055 --> 00:51:16,245
then his out of it or does

1486
00:51:16,305 --> 00:51:19,125
the cornell master keep orchestrating this much

1487
00:51:19,125 --> 00:51:21,645
like falco orchestrated rock me amadeus let

1488
00:51:21,675 --> 00:51:23,055
me read on okay

1489
00:51:24,255 --> 00:51:27,225
um or the different groups of cornell

1490
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:29,025
players can vary and exactly what kinds

1491
00:51:29,025 --> 00:51:30,585
of links are permissible so we can

1492
00:51:30,585 --> 00:51:32,565
decide okay what it needs to be

1493
00:51:33,255 --> 00:51:35,625
a notable regional variation is that some

1494
00:51:35,625 --> 00:51:37,785
gatherings such as the chicago area mensa

1495
00:51:39,195 --> 00:51:40,365
these fucking assholes

1496
00:51:41,085 --> 00:51:42,855
i'll come back hey welcome and i'm

1497
00:51:43,125 --> 00:51:46,005
usually not an acceptable linkage what if

1498
00:51:46,005 --> 00:51:47,505
we did movie whatever we did movie

1499
00:51:47,505 --> 00:51:50,655
titles but the or titles of anything

1500
00:51:50,655 --> 00:51:52,365
but the next title has to be

1501
00:51:52,365 --> 00:51:54,075
the very last word has to start

1502
00:51:54,075 --> 00:51:55,125
with the very last word that we

1503
00:51:55,125 --> 00:51:59,115
just did okay okay alright with there's

1504
00:51:59,115 --> 00:52:01,185
no kylie master anymore about ca

1505
00:52:01,185 --> 00:52:02,895
tonelli okay the next title has to

1506
00:52:02,895 --> 00:52:04,937
start with the last last word of

1507
00:52:04,937 --> 00:52:05,865
that previous and it could be a

1508
00:52:05,865 --> 00:52:07,065
song title it can be a movie

1509
00:52:07,065 --> 00:52:08,287
title it can be to be a

1510
00:52:08,292 --> 00:52:10,365
title of anything title of anything but

1511
00:52:10,365 --> 00:52:13,035
the last word has to be the

1512
00:52:13,035 --> 00:52:14,618
first word of the next title and

1513
00:52:14,627 --> 00:52:16,335
will go clockwise and lauren will start

1514
00:52:16,365 --> 00:52:18,675
how does that sound paul i think

1515
00:52:18,675 --> 00:52:21,315
that sounds good i think that obviously

1516
00:52:21,765 --> 00:52:23,205
like you don't have a limited time

1517
00:52:23,205 --> 00:52:24,727
to come up with a title um

1518
00:52:24,727 --> 00:52:26,535
i think we kevin can be the

1519
00:52:26,535 --> 00:52:28,935
cornell master and point was why do

1520
00:52:28,935 --> 00:52:30,405
we need a cornell yes or no

1521
00:52:30,405 --> 00:52:32,295
because he can he can move it

1522
00:52:32,295 --> 00:52:35,175
along timewise he can police the time

1523
00:52:35,205 --> 00:52:36,375
alright so what are we going in

1524
00:52:36,375 --> 00:52:39,615
