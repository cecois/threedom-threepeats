00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:18,987
on youtube of some usb show with

82
00:03:18,987 --> 00:03:19,140
some

83
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,579
team that mary holland was it and

84
00:03:20,579 --> 00:03:22,950
they did a scene where people showed

85
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:26,430
up in bathing suits and mary was

86
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:28,500
wearing a bikini but did she do

87
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:30,780
she drew abs honors

88
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:36,900
it is really funny that is funny

89
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:40,650
ah stuff yeah that's really cool that

90
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:42,900

91
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:44,700
libyan leader

92
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,150
she never will be just want to

93
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:50,250
reiterate marry hollywood never be on freedom

94
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:52,710
that's good promise we should if we

95
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:54,090
if one of us can't make a

96
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:56,340
show we should have to cover our

97
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:57,660
shift with someone else

98
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:00,300
that's weird like like when you're a

99
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:01,770
waiter like if you can't make your

100
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:03,960
know i got the councillors indeed doesn't

101
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,850
have to be about waiting tables or

102
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:07,710
just think it makes sense it's like

103
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:09,660
a restaurant has these people that take

104
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,210
dinner orders from the patrons well here's

105
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:13,350
the thing like it's like it's cafe

106
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:15,600
cardinale like if i couldn't be there

107
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,160
then like i would get someone to

108
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,960
cover my shift so far so thorough

109
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:21,690
graphic audio it's my we're still around

110
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:22,860
you would be in there every day

111
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,350
it's saying you know arose i'm honestly

112
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:27,210
so gross

113
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,180
it was good i if if it

114
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:31,170
were still around i would go there

115
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:32,310
i'm kind of disappointed i never got

116
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:34,800
to go there yeah i went back

117
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,660
after i quit what jobs have you

118
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:39,150

like i would only every other job

122
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:47,400
like i've mentioned i would only work

123
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,000
for like two days

124
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,930
and then i would have so much

125
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:50,430
stress about going again that i couldn't

126
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:51,600
ever go and i'd have to quit

127
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,640
but then i would like sometimes go

00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:56,460
by the place big e like i

129
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:57,947

the other day i left that i

143
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:24,030
lost that job when the place went

144
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:26,040
out of business and then like a

145
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,950
year two years later they reopened in

146
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:30,000
the same resolution

147
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,580
no same name it was weird and

148
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,260
like the places with the band breaks

149
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:35,910
up and then they reform different name

150
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:36,660

00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:39,540
that's happened to me yeah that's how

152
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:40,530
they were trying to get rid of

00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:42,480
me they couldn't fire me i had

154
00:05:42,487 --> 00:05:45,480

155
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:48,780
up and got back together as echostar

156
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,690

00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,650
definitely well the first thing that comes

231
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:18,810
to mind is like the i'm sure

232
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:20,670
i've told this story but it's not

233
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:22,590
greater and thing but i've i've told

234
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:23,670
you i'm sure with preamble

235
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:27,600
ah but when i was little i

236
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,820
was like um running around the neighborhood

237
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:31,320
and i picked all these flowers and

238
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,390
then they were in from someone's yard

239
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,500
and the guy came out and like

240
00:08:34,501 --> 00:08:36,360
yelled at me and i cried like

241
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,350
ran home and like threw them in

242
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:40,440
a ditch three hours in a ditch

243
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:42,270
and i was getting from my mom

244
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,693
and i don't like to highway

245
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,220
my role in to go buy his

246
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:50,040
home sure and then we also had

247
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,200
our neighbor who was um did you

248
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,520

249
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:56,040
you tell your parents about this encounter

250
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,630
i think i did run home and

251
00:08:57,630 --> 00:09:00,420
cry but because if you had just

252
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:01,500
like gone back to the house and

253
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,206
apologized he would have been like oh

254
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:04,200
it's fine and you would have felt

255
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,040
good about it and you

256
00:09:05,070 --> 00:09:06,600
could have gone by there whenever no

257
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,770
i don't recall anyone telling me to

258
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:10,890

259
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:12,157
when some old man comes in and

260
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:13,380

330
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:36,405

338
00:11:50,325 --> 00:11:53,055
like that he was supposed to be

339
00:11:53,055 --> 00:11:55,305
with her and now it was like

340
00:11:55,305 --> 00:11:58,095
a delusional sort of right yeah thing

341
00:11:58,125 --> 00:11:59,445
was he holding up a sign that

342
00:11:59,445 --> 00:12:00,705
had a picture of a screw and

343
00:12:00,705 --> 00:12:03,285
then plus in a baseball or yeah

344
00:12:03,285 --> 00:12:07,335
that's how he always communicated ah no

345
00:12:07,335 --> 00:12:08,685
i don't i don't know i should

346
00:12:08,685 --> 00:12:10,125
ask my parents the ins and outs

347
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:11,205
of that of their sight of that

348
00:12:11,205 --> 00:12:12,765
because i only remember from my perspective

349
00:12:12,765 --> 00:12:14,355
that there was just like let's call

350
00:12:14,355 --> 00:12:15,855
him right now he was fairly low

351
00:12:15,855 --> 00:12:18,135
key inside the house but it was

352
00:12:18,135 --> 00:12:20,865
crazy outside of the house yeah very

353
00:12:21,015 --> 00:12:23,865
whatever happened to her storm she eventually

354
00:12:23,865 --> 00:12:26,385
passed away i don't know how y'all

355
00:12:26,385 --> 00:12:28,965
will yeah imam but i was always

356
00:12:28,965 --> 00:12:31,695
afraid of her house because you know

357
00:12:31,725 --> 00:12:32,655
when you're a little kid you just

358
00:12:32,655 --> 00:12:34,785
don't understand so get a few houses

359
00:12:34,785 --> 00:12:36,885
in the neighborhood that were don't understand

360
00:12:36,975 --> 00:12:39,675
parents just don't understand we had a

361
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:41,025
few scary houses in the neighbor

362
00:12:41,025 --> 00:12:42,045
but there was one there was a

363
00:12:42,045 --> 00:12:44,805
house on our corner that was unlike

364
00:12:44,865 --> 00:12:47,745
any other house in the entire neighborhood

365
00:12:47,775 --> 00:12:50,385
it was this really it it was

366
00:12:50,385 --> 00:12:53,385
like i wonder if the person who

367
00:12:53,595 --> 00:12:55,185
who lived there was the person who

368
00:12:55,185 --> 00:12:57,945
built the house because it was kind

369
00:12:57,945 --> 00:13:01,095
of modern it was on this big

370
00:13:01,485 --> 00:13:02,805
kind of property like they had the

371
00:13:02,805 --> 00:13:05,115
whole corner to themselves we call it

372
00:13:05,175 --> 00:13:07,425
we call it it was alternately called

373
00:13:07,425 --> 00:13:11,025
rob's hill or hippies hill because of

374
00:13:11,025 --> 00:13:12,645
people that lived there were like hippies

375
00:13:12,645 --> 00:13:15,915
man but they had a um the

376
00:13:15,915 --> 00:13:17,595
two big attractions there were they had

377
00:13:17,595 --> 00:13:20,505
a crab apple tree where these shiny

378
00:13:20,535 --> 00:13:21,345
grapple hill

379
00:13:21,345 --> 00:13:23,925
well well that's you're taking rob out

380
00:13:23,925 --> 00:13:25,065
of the equation i mean it says

381
00:13:25,155 --> 00:13:27,465
why didn't they call it crabapple like

382
00:13:27,465 --> 00:13:29,835
simpsons i think because the simpsons haven't

383
00:13:29,835 --> 00:13:31,785
happened yet and they couldn't do it

384
00:13:31,815 --> 00:13:34,245
they never thought of it yeah um

385
00:13:34,275 --> 00:13:35,835
but the credible true is huge leads

386
00:13:35,835 --> 00:13:37,395
to go climb that we never by

387
00:13:37,395 --> 00:13:38,835
the way never saw the people that

388
00:13:38,835 --> 00:13:41,235
lived there never was a property like

389
00:13:41,235 --> 00:13:41,445
in there

390
00:13:41,505 --> 00:13:42,675
front yard but you would still climb

391
00:13:42,675 --> 00:13:44,775
in their tree or yeah no the

392
00:13:44,775 --> 00:13:46,185
tree was in their backyard they had

393
00:13:46,185 --> 00:13:48,675
lard it was weird because their their

394
00:13:48,675 --> 00:13:50,865
house did it sat on this corner

395
00:13:50,865 --> 00:13:53,475
it was like this this no-fuss hill

396
00:13:53,505 --> 00:13:55,635
around no fence and so sometimes we

397
00:13:55,635 --> 00:13:58,095
would cut through to go around the

398
00:13:58,095 --> 00:14:01,335
corner um and we never saw anybody

399
00:14:01,335 --> 00:14:01,665
that live

400
00:14:01,665 --> 00:14:03,135
phd there but we would look in

401
00:14:03,135 --> 00:14:04,695
like like they had a glass front

402
00:14:04,695 --> 00:14:07,065
door those behind this this foliage we

403
00:14:07,065 --> 00:14:08,655
would like look in it and you

404
00:14:08,655 --> 00:14:09,735
know see this it was like kind

405
00:14:09,735 --> 00:14:12,585
of a grand cool house um i

406
00:14:12,585 --> 00:14:13,875
wish i wish i could have gone

407
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:15,555
inside there at one point but we

408
00:14:15,555 --> 00:14:17,175
never went in so so the crab

409
00:14:17,175 --> 00:14:18,135
apple tree we would play in the

410
00:14:18,135 --> 00:14:20,025
crab apple tree my little buddies we

411
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:21,405
would get crowd apples and throw them

412
00:14:21,405 --> 00:14:21,735
at shit

413
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:25,035
now throw the cars and buses does

414
00:14:25,035 --> 00:14:27,015
anyone eat crab apples like is there

415
00:14:27,045 --> 00:14:29,295
a crab apple pie recipe there is

416
00:14:29,295 --> 00:14:30,675
actually yeah yeah really you can put

417
00:14:30,675 --> 00:14:32,295
crab apples and things you can't crap

418
00:14:32,295 --> 00:14:33,375
up i don't think as a thing

419
00:14:33,375 --> 00:14:34,575
you can bite into and be like

420
00:14:34,605 --> 00:14:35,175
yum yum

421
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:37,005
think you can i think you can

422
00:14:37,005 --> 00:14:39,015
use it in cooking um the other

423
00:14:39,015 --> 00:14:42,075
attraction was they had a big ah

424
00:14:42,135 --> 00:14:45,975
garage like a multi-car garage and inside

425
00:14:46,395 --> 00:14:49,845
was what was a dog but to

426
00:14:49,845 --> 00:14:52,995
us was a terrifying monster because i

427
00:14:52,995 --> 00:14:54,675
think it was like a it must

428
00:14:54,675 --> 00:14:55,815
have been like a wolfhound

429
00:14:55,905 --> 00:14:57,615
nothing like that like a big dog

430
00:14:58,605 --> 00:15:00,855
because it would jump up to the

431
00:15:00,855 --> 00:15:02,415
window and like it would bark like

432
00:15:02,415 --> 00:15:03,607
crazy and jump up to the windows

433
00:15:03,607 --> 00:15:05,295
so you only got a glimpse of

434
00:15:05,295 --> 00:15:07,695
it um you know like this just

435
00:15:07,695 --> 00:15:08,565
like fangs

436
00:15:09,615 --> 00:15:11,415
and this horrendous noise but it was

437
00:15:11,415 --> 00:15:15,015
like we would like creep up to

438
00:15:15,015 --> 00:15:16,845
it to see like how far you

439
00:15:16,845 --> 00:15:18,105
can get before the dog would go

440
00:15:18,105 --> 00:15:20,745
crazy but i remember i remember in

441
00:15:20,745 --> 00:15:24,405
my i clearly remember the the realization

442
00:15:24,555 --> 00:15:25,905
when i when i realised like oh

443
00:15:25,905 --> 00:15:27,165
no it's a dog it's just a

444
00:15:27,165 --> 00:15:27,345
dog

445
00:15:28,365 --> 00:15:31,125
yeah i'm bigger than it now yeah

446
00:15:31,155 --> 00:15:32,835
probably yeah but it was it was

447
00:15:32,925 --> 00:15:34,706
it was so scary and i think

448
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:36,375
nice dark in that garage it was

449
00:15:36,375 --> 00:15:37,545
well maybe i mean maybe you were

450
00:15:37,545 --> 00:15:39,045
only passing by during the day and

451
00:15:39,045 --> 00:15:40,515
they were both working or is a

452
00:15:40,515 --> 00:15:42,225
single guy who was working or saying

453
00:15:42,255 --> 00:15:43,815
leaving his dog there i think there

454
00:15:43,815 --> 00:15:45,435
must have there must have been multiple

455
00:15:45,435 --> 00:15:46,635
people who lived in that house at

456
00:15:46,635 --> 00:15:48,405
one time um

457
00:15:48,465 --> 00:15:49,455
and that's how i got the name

458
00:15:49,455 --> 00:15:50,865
hippies hill but it was like we

459
00:15:50,865 --> 00:15:52,785
would go we would like moon children

460
00:15:53,145 --> 00:15:54,645
it was like ah yeah moon children

461
00:15:54,645 --> 00:15:55,485
probably

462
00:15:57,795 --> 00:15:58,905
you know it's got something to think

463
00:15:58,905 --> 00:15:59,985
of it i think it was moon

464
00:15:59,985 --> 00:16:01,995
children that's what it was called you

465
00:16:01,995 --> 00:16:03,855
just forgot but we would like slid

466
00:16:03,855 --> 00:16:04,965
off of that hill it was not

467
00:16:04,965 --> 00:16:06,885
like it was like super steep but

468
00:16:06,885 --> 00:16:07,845
it was enough that you could get

469
00:16:07,845 --> 00:16:10,095
one of those like round coaster things

470
00:16:10,095 --> 00:16:11,895
you know and you can slide down

471
00:16:11,985 --> 00:16:13,117
you could slide down the hill and

472
00:16:13,117 --> 00:16:14,325
and would take you all the because

473
00:16:14,355 --> 00:16:15,885
we lived on a on an a

474
00:16:15,885 --> 00:16:16,785
grade an upgrade

475
00:16:16,785 --> 00:16:17,955
all it would take you all the

476
00:16:17,955 --> 00:16:19,995
way down the street so could glenn

477
00:16:20,055 --> 00:16:21,555
it was it was great fun never

478
00:16:21,555 --> 00:16:23,865
saw hey why would never anybody come

479
00:16:23,865 --> 00:16:25,725
out of the house even to say

480
00:16:25,725 --> 00:16:27,285

482
00:16:29,325 --> 00:16:31,635

um i will

486
00:16:36,945 --> 00:16:38,475
i'll try to it's it's kind of

487
00:16:38,475 --> 00:16:39,915
hard to get the sense of it

488
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:41,175
i really wanted to see the house

489
00:16:41,175 --> 00:16:43,275
itself but there is so much greenery

490
00:16:43,275 --> 00:16:44,745
around it you especially if it's ever

491
00:16:44,745 --> 00:16:46,335
been on sale in the pictures from

492
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:47,952
the inside or what yeah yeah yeah

493
00:16:48,177 --> 00:16:49,638
i would love that i would love

494
00:16:49,638 --> 00:16:51,165
them or whatever yeah should look up

495
00:16:51,345 --> 00:16:52,755
the address was hard to find because

496
00:16:52,755 --> 00:16:54,795
i couldn't remember the exact address right

497
00:16:54,825 --> 00:16:56,505
but i'll get on the case i'll

498
00:16:56,505 --> 00:16:57,075
get on like yeah

499
00:16:57,135 --> 00:16:58,155
we had a house that we called

500
00:16:58,155 --> 00:17:01,785
the mansion was like i have to

501
00:17:01,785 --> 00:17:03,765
look it up too because now it

502
00:17:03,765 --> 00:17:06,375
probably would be so small but it

503
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:08,175
was the biggest house in the neighborhood

504
00:17:08,175 --> 00:17:09,645
for blocks and blocks it felt like

505
00:17:09,645 --> 00:17:11,775
it was two stories maybe and just

506
00:17:11,775 --> 00:17:13,605
like bigger than and it i think

507
00:17:13,605 --> 00:17:15,255
maybe the style of it was it

508
00:17:15,255 --> 00:17:17,235
was like an old kind of southern

509
00:17:17,265 --> 00:17:18,495
mansion or something like that and we

510
00:17:18,495 --> 00:17:19,755
all called it the mansion because it

511
00:17:19,755 --> 00:17:22,095
was just the biggest grandest house out

512
00:17:22,095 --> 00:17:24,165
of out of the neighborhood and they

513
00:17:24,165 --> 00:17:26,265
once for halloween they they really did

514
00:17:26,265 --> 00:17:28,305

all dressed up like mannequin like like

517
00:17:33,405 --> 00:17:35,745
ah mannequins on the porch sitting in

518
00:17:35,745 --> 00:17:37,425
rocking chairs that you thought were like

519
00:17:37,425 --> 00:17:39,525
useless dummies and you would go up

520
00:17:39,525 --> 00:17:40,605
to the front and be like oh

00:17:40,605 --> 00:17:42,675
they're just dummies that they that they

522
00:17:42,705 --> 00:17:43,935
put together and then all of a

523
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:45,195

00:18:59,595 --> 00:19:01,275
you were supposed to fill yes yes

559
00:19:01,335 --> 00:19:04,395
yes i mean even even like um

560
00:19:04,425 --> 00:19:06,375
i think like fifth grade started to

561
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:08,055
feel a little bit weird but then

562
00:19:08,055 --> 00:19:10,755
like oh wow definitely sixth grade was

563
00:19:10,755 --> 00:19:13,665
two two yeah junior high is probably

564
00:19:13,665 --> 00:19:14,145
too old so

565
00:19:14,145 --> 00:19:15,345
seventh grade is too all right but

566
00:19:15,345 --> 00:19:17,415
that's when we would go smashing pumpkins

567
00:19:17,415 --> 00:19:19,845
and you know be crazy together with

568
00:19:19,845 --> 00:19:22,425
the with the boys was epic yeah

569
00:19:22,425 --> 00:19:24,375
in chicago and smashing pumpkins is from

570
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:26,625
chicago yeah so we knew we had

571
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:27,825
to do that to keep the band

572
00:19:27,825 --> 00:19:29,685
alive i remember we used to go

573
00:19:29,685 --> 00:19:34,305
guns and roses yeah from philly no

574
00:19:34,305 --> 00:19:34,605
no

575
00:19:36,075 --> 00:19:37,395
but it was food in their sighting

576
00:19:37,395 --> 00:19:38,865
like once you like once you became

577
00:19:38,865 --> 00:19:40,275
a little too old then you're like

578
00:19:40,545 --> 00:19:42,541
now we'd hang out on halloween and

579
00:19:42,541 --> 00:19:43,965
then that's like a different kind of

580
00:19:43,995 --> 00:19:47,023
yeah yes exactly lumpy scares that turned

581
00:19:47,023 --> 00:19:49,395

621
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:15,540
thing where there was a way to

622
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:16,740
this karate school called cobra

623
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:17,280
chi

00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,520
they they got a cauldron and my

625
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,320
dad got dry ice and made it

626
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:25,560
like bubble wow and and we bobbed

627
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,210

for apples in this cauldron you know

629
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:30,810
that we did tell dry ice keep

630
00:21:30,810 --> 00:21:32,700
tugs that i remember and it was

631
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,230
everyone had to dress up and it

632
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:36,420
was it was those first time that

633
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:38,610
i had ever realized that

634
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,720
what we were doing like i'm on

635
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:40,200
instagram

636
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:45,450
it's the first time i ever realised

637
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:49,080
how juvenile like this was and how

638
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:51,180
uncool it was and i felt mortified

639
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:53,820
that my parents went to such trouble

640
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:56,430
to make it like spooky but in

641
00:21:56,430 --> 00:21:58,680
a kid's way and yell with fake

642
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,570
cobwebs and stuff and i just felt

643
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:01,410
really judged by

644
00:22:01,444 --> 00:22:03,390
these new kids you know that's awkward

645
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:05,322
were at this like stupid party you

646
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:06,750
also had a murder mystery party was

647
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:08,010
which was a lot like that too

648
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:09,570
yeah you probably got beat up at

649
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:12,480
that one um what what i i

650
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:14,520
think though what's funny is like that

651
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,560
at that age you think oh this

652
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:18,660
is corny but if you went now

653
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:19,950
as an adult and somebody did that

654
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:21,300
in their house you would think like

655
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:21,540
oh this

656
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,820
oh i love it yeah absolutely there's

657
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:27,900
thirteen to eighteen year old period or

658
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:30,210
something like that where it's everything is

659
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:33,300
uncool yeah there was this ah person

660
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:35,490
that even making up used to be

661
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:37,620
friends with who had an aunt who

662
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:41,130

into a manila envelope

778
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:49,950

783
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,260
back to the seven eleven and this

784
00:26:58,260 --> 00:26:59,340

studio that we recorded

800
00:27:33,872 --> 00:27:35,160

stayed pretty connected with my friends through

995
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,960
social media and whatever like i feel

996
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,190
like i am aware what everyone's like

997
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:19,230
up to but it's so different when

998
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:20,340
you're just running into everyone all the

999
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:20,520
time

1000
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:22,320
i'm yeah there's just like that kind

1001
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,180
of like the friendship is sustained by

1002
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:25,290
you just like seeing each other all

1003
00:34:25,290 --> 00:34:27,240
the time at the theater and whatnot

1004
00:34:27,270 --> 00:34:30,660
yeah it made me realize i want

1005
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:33,150
to see people i want to make

1006
00:34:33,150 --> 00:34:34,230
more of an effort to see people

1007
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:36,720
because i realized you know how much

1008
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:40,320

1011
00:34:41,883 --> 00:34:43,740
not like we hate going out but

1012
00:34:44,370 --> 00:34:47,760
we i really did miss seeing so

1013
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:50,580

1014
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:51,630
like i want to have people over

1015
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:53,040

1016
00:34:53,070 --> 00:34:56,910
yeah like sit around a table and

1017
00:34:56,910 --> 00:34:59,190
share a meal and and talk and

1018
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,810
laugh you know and i want to

1019
00:35:00,870 --> 00:35:03,570
make an effort to to to i

1020
00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:04,830
want to really make an effort to

1021
00:35:04,830 --> 00:35:06,360
do that more to make it a

1022
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:08,820
regular thing yeah it's not something that

1023
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:09,990
you just keep thinking like oh we

1024
00:35:09,990 --> 00:35:11,700
should have them over some time and

1025
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:13,290
then you never knew him i know

1026
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,090
well how was the barbecue went to

1027
00:35:15,090 --> 00:35:15,390
paul

1028
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:17,788
it you know why it was a

1029
00:35:17,788 --> 00:35:19,740
real it was fun but it was

1030
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:21,840
kind of a challenge and it was

1031
00:35:21,930 --> 00:35:26,580
ah ah a strange return to normal

1032
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:28,890
life that i hadn't thought about because

1033
00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:29,850
it was a part it was a

1034
00:35:29,850 --> 00:35:32,310
small party about you know twenty twenty

1035
00:35:32,310 --> 00:35:35,460
five people and it was half people

1036
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:36,390
that i knew and have people i

1037
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:36,600
did

1038
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,580
didn't know so it was just enough

1039
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:40,080
to give me like a little anxiety

1040
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:41,550
you know what i mean yeah that

1041
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:43,290
that feeling of like i'm sitting with

1042
00:35:43,290 --> 00:35:45,150
somebody that i don't know super well

1043
00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:47,910
but i kind of know and i

1044
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:52,500
felt the um the the not pressure

1045
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:53,910
but i felt the obligations like keep

1046
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:56,190
the conversation going yeah but you haven't

1047
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:56,640
had to do it

1048
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:57,990
which i'm going to do in a

1049
00:35:57,990 --> 00:36:00,300
while but i i what i realized

1050
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:02,190
is ah oh here's what i'm gonna

1051
00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:04,500
do is ah i'm going to keep

1052
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:06,270
asking questions so i'm not the person

1053
00:36:06,270 --> 00:36:09,360
that has to ah keep talking yeah

1054
00:36:09,390 --> 00:36:11,550
yeah yeah and so i'll let and

1055
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:13,200
i'm fine till like literally a person

1056
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,330
and my age and everything it really

1057
00:36:15,330 --> 00:36:16,800
is yeah i'm fighting like hell

1058
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,900
figured that out you know like in

1059
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:20,460
my early twenties i was like oh

1060
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:22,980
if i ask questions like the conversation

1061
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,750
is way easier if i have questions

1062
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:25,770
about this person i don't give a

1063
00:36:25,770 --> 00:36:28,500
shit about yeah they'll keep talking and

1064
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:30,330
then someone's like we did something and

1065
00:36:30,330 --> 00:36:32,070
honestly it's like now you have a

1066
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:34,800
a perfect icebreaker you know is to

1067
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,420
just ask people how are they feeling

1068
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:37,080
about things

1069
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:38,700
you know and don't don't ask them

1070
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:39,931
how their year has been but asked

1071
00:36:39,931 --> 00:36:41,010
and how are they feeling about things

1072
00:36:41,010 --> 00:36:42,720
opening up and everything like yeah because

1073
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,100
everybody kind of wants to talk about

1074
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:45,870
it and and talk about their feelings

1075
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:48,690
about it but i i did feel

1076
00:36:48,690 --> 00:36:49,860
like and then when it was time

1077
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:51,660
to go it was also it was

1078
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:54,090
an afternoon thing and so like step

1079
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,430
i'm not a big fan of afternoon

1080
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:57,150
parties

1081
00:36:57,488 --> 00:36:59,190
there's like a standing in the sun

1082
00:36:59,190 --> 00:37:00,965
aspect to it that i don't enjoy

1083
00:37:00,990 --> 00:37:04,020
it makes me tired and um so

1084
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:05,310
when we were getting ready to go

1085
00:37:05,310 --> 00:37:07,380
then it's like you get stopped by

1086
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:08,910
people that you know and now it's

1087
00:37:08,910 --> 00:37:10,590
like everyone you see somebody you haven't

1088
00:37:10,590 --> 00:37:12,720
seen in forever i know so it's

1089
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:15,180
so weird yeah but i gotta say

1090
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:17,370
i felt like everybody was on the

1091
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:20,040
the same level of understanding you know

1092
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:22,320
yeah everybody got it everybody was like

1093
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:24,330

to see you you know so it

1096
00:37:27,530 --> 00:37:29,400
it felt very um it felt very

1097
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,980
welcoming and and easy in that way

1098
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:33,840
but yeah i did it took me

1099
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,250
a while to process like oh why

1100
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:36,300

1101
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:37,140

1103
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:41,910
mean the the shower was like a

1104
00:37:41,910 --> 00:37:44,400
step a dipping up for the toe

1105
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,140
because i was like having wasn't everyone

1106
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:47,430
chances but it wasn't everyone at the

1107
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:48,720
same time and that was getting nice

1108
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,910
and i had like a little moment

00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:52,890
with everyone which which worked well and

1110

1136
00:38:43,350 --> 00:38:44,370
kind of hard i was just like

1137
00:38:44,370 --> 00:38:46,770
worrying that i wouldn't feel connected to

1138
00:38:46,770 --> 00:38:49,800
everyone but my sister-in-law organized it and

1139
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,150
it was really great and she put

1140
00:38:51,150 --> 00:38:54,930
together like videos from friends and family

1141
00:38:54,930 --> 00:38:57,810
and like a powerpoint rangers you know

1142
00:38:57,810 --> 00:38:58,200

1143
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:01,260
eighty sort of thing strangers mark cameos

1144
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:02,670
from like a bunker where guys would

1145
00:39:02,670 --> 00:39:04,050
be so awesome if someone was like

1146
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:05,580
hey this video for your birthday or

1147
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:07,650
whatever and it was just strangers reaching

1148
00:39:08,136 --> 00:39:10,740
that's cameo and yeah like yeah i

1149
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:13,590
really care about you huh all these

1150
00:39:13,590 --> 00:39:15,360
people hey your friends tell me you

1151
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,170
were born

1152
00:39:18,030 --> 00:39:19,590
um and then i you know open

1153
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:20,940
presence that my family had sent and

1154
00:39:20,941 --> 00:39:22,470
stuff and it was really it actually

1155
00:39:22,470 --> 00:39:24,090
felt really great and it felt as

1156
00:39:24,090 --> 00:39:26,730
normal as it could given the circumstances

1157
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:28,470
and i tell you i kind of

1158
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:31,020
i've been to a couple aa drive

1159
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:34,590
by birthday things showers whatever i kind

1160
00:39:34,590 --> 00:39:35,880
of like it and i think it

1161
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,560
should stay a handful of people

1162
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:38,730
well said that as they were coming

1163
00:39:38,730 --> 00:39:40,290
through like this is how everything should

1164
00:39:40,290 --> 00:39:41,880
be it's like i they had a

1165
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:44,760
scheduled window of time to show like

1166
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:46,830
got to talk for a bit have

1167
00:39:46,830 --> 00:39:48,540
yeah and then they drove off and

1168
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:50,520
it's like low pressure it was yeah

1169
00:39:50,670 --> 00:39:52,740
very easy and i do think that

1170
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:54,330
i think you should install a drive

1171
00:39:54,330 --> 00:39:56,490
through window at your place yeah yeah

1172
00:39:56,490 --> 00:39:57,600
and then if you want to combine

1173
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:57,720
say

1174
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:59,490
it's something i mean i think it's

1175
00:39:59,490 --> 00:40:02,430
nice also just because of this year

1176
00:40:02,430 --> 00:40:03,930
like not really socializing it's kinda the

1177
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:06,150
perfect amount of socializing like yeah you

1178
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:07,278
don't want don't have to talk to

1179
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:09,690
one hundred people like you know everyone

1180
00:40:09,690 --> 00:40:10,740
who goes to the party doesn't have

1181
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:12,030
to talk to everyone else it's not

1182
00:40:12,030 --> 00:40:12,810
like the whole thing we were like

1183
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:13,860
now have to go and be there

1184
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:15,660
for an hour whatever it's like you

1185
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:16,980
just get to have a little moment

1186
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:17,820
and of connection

1187
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:19,200
which is nice but yeah i went

1188
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,420
to a backyard barbecue the other day

1189
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:24,480
and it was probably fifty people ooh

1190
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,790
so and the minute i got there

1191
00:40:26,790 --> 00:40:28,140
we were some of the last people

1192
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:30,000
to arrive i think because it had

1193
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,530
been going on for four hours before

1194
00:40:31,530 --> 00:40:35,160
we got there i think and immediately

1195
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:38,040
people started hugging us

1196
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,450
and i was like no we're not

1197
00:40:39,450 --> 00:40:42,390
bringing this back we learned oh i

1198
00:40:42,390 --> 00:40:43,470
don't have a wrong with that at

1199
00:40:43,470 --> 00:40:45,690
all it's got never liked tugging that's

1200
00:40:45,690 --> 00:40:47,940
true all i'm a hugger yeah i

1201
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:49,920
just like i don't know and it

1202
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,690
wasn't it wasn't people i'm especially close

1203
00:40:51,690 --> 00:40:53,010
with well that's part of that's part

1204
00:40:53,010 --> 00:40:54,450
of what i mean i feel like

1205
00:40:54,450 --> 00:40:56,730
when this when this happened and then

1206
00:40:56,730 --> 00:40:57,690
you work you know we're kind of

1207
00:40:57,690 --> 00:40:58,200
reflecting

1208
00:40:58,905 --> 00:41:00,405
six months in it was like i

1209
00:41:00,405 --> 00:41:01,995
was always hugging everyone you know like

1210
00:41:01,995 --> 00:41:03,495
i i did have that feeling like

1211
00:41:03,735 --> 00:41:05,925
i'm not really a hugger but i've

1212
00:41:05,955 --> 00:41:08,955
have become one kind of social hugger

1213
00:41:09,405 --> 00:41:11,475
of the climate yeah yeah everyone does

1214
00:41:11,475 --> 00:41:13,455
it and it's like eight but then

1215
00:41:13,455 --> 00:41:15,315
there's the times we're like i'm hugging

1216
00:41:15,315 --> 00:41:16,665
someone and i feel like we've neither

1217
00:41:16,665 --> 00:41:17,985
of us want to be hugging you

1218
00:41:17,985 --> 00:41:19,035
know it's like why are we do

1219
00:41:19,065 --> 00:41:21,195
this yeah and ultimately like people were

1220
00:41:21,195 --> 00:41:23,085
hugging because it's like we're out in

1221
00:41:23,085 --> 00:41:26,145
the world come here yeah yeah okay

1222
00:41:26,145 --> 00:41:27,135
i mean and there and there were

1223
00:41:27,135 --> 00:41:30,195
some people that i technically would would

1224
00:41:30,195 --> 00:41:31,425
hug in any situation but i was

1225
00:41:31,425 --> 00:41:32,835
just like i thought we were getting

1226
00:41:32,835 --> 00:41:34,635
rid of hugs and shaking hands and

1227
00:41:34,635 --> 00:41:35,955
stuff like that and then the first

1228
00:41:35,955 --> 00:41:38,025
social situation i'm in people are immediately

1229
00:41:38,025 --> 00:41:39,195
like grabbing me yeah

1230
00:41:39,195 --> 00:41:41,805

watching that show they called her mayor

1372
00:46:20,895 --> 00:46:22,995
because she was the mayor i expected

1373
00:46:23,205 --> 00:46:25,605
to be like mister mayor that is

1374
00:46:25,605 --> 00:46:27,165

1375
00:46:27,165 --> 00:46:29,655

00:46:29,655 --> 00:46:31,245
about the shows that it's based on

1377
00:46:31,275 --> 00:46:33,075

1386
00:46:50,445 --> 00:46:52,245
how people in the region say mayor

right so no well that's what i

1388
00:46:54,345 --> 00:46:55,575
thought it was but it turned out

1389
00:46:55,575 --> 00:46:56,775
not to end in the final episode

1390
00:46:56,775 --> 00:46:59,415

even her mother was calling her the

1398
00:47:12,825 --> 00:47:14,355
