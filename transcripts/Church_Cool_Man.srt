00:15:03,265 --> 00:15:04,795
yeah yeah yeah and it's also fun

377
00:15:04,795 --> 00:15:05,993
because we could hear in her backyard

378
00:15:05,995 --> 00:15:07,165
but then we went over there and

379
00:15:07,165 --> 00:15:08,515
watched it for a little bit and

380
00:15:08,515 --> 00:15:11,185
um i was thinking when are they

381
00:15:11,185 --> 00:15:14,155
going to play the hits and they

382
00:15:14,185 --> 00:15:15,355
did at one point but that was

383
00:15:15,355 --> 00:15:17,395
like a lot of these chicago songs

384
00:15:17,395 --> 00:15:18,775
i don't care about i like like

385
00:15:18,775 --> 00:15:19,228
five

386
00:15:19,525 --> 00:15:20,995
and i wanna hear them cry what

387
00:15:21,085 --> 00:15:22,135
a cool up and i went to

388
00:15:22,135 --> 00:15:23,695
go see them at the greek and

389
00:15:23,695 --> 00:15:26,395
we were similarly disappointed because we when

390
00:15:26,395 --> 00:15:28,705
we first got together we were constantly

391
00:15:29,005 --> 00:15:32,395
singing their eighties love hits like like

392
00:15:32,455 --> 00:15:35,245
ah yeah i can't even remember what

393
00:15:35,245 --> 00:15:36,835
they all are but um but then

394
00:15:36,835 --> 00:15:37,975
when we went to see them they

395
00:15:37,975 --> 00:15:39,055
were playing all that like

396
00:15:39,565 --> 00:15:42,415
horn seventies band music and we were

397
00:15:42,415 --> 00:15:43,465
like these guys are a bunch of

398
00:15:43,465 --> 00:15:45,745
band geeks yeah i have the meaning

399
00:15:45,775 --> 00:15:47,815
of of the song the song's title

400
00:15:47,815 --> 00:15:49,555
is the time at which the song

401
00:15:49,555 --> 00:15:51,355
is set which is called y twenty

402
00:15:51,355 --> 00:15:53,635
five or twenty six minutes before four

403
00:15:53,665 --> 00:15:56,005
a m because of the twenty five

404
00:15:56,005 --> 00:15:57,925
or six to forcibly like forty five

405
00:15:57,925 --> 00:15:59,665
or twenty six to four

406
00:15:59,725 --> 00:16:02,485
yeah not how you say that you

407
00:16:02,485 --> 00:16:05,185

408
00:16:05,246 --> 00:16:07,135
to be in five availed reference to

409
00:16:07,135 --> 00:16:10,135
drug quantities or mystical illusion i was

410
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:11,125

439
00:17:13,435 --> 00:17:15,535
every other time know michelle collins nikki

440
00:17:15,565 --> 00:17:19,315
glaser come on um when my friend

441
00:17:19,315 --> 00:17:20,515
did the morning show at indy one

442
00:17:20,515 --> 00:17:21,355
or three one which is the whole

443
00:17:21,355 --> 00:17:23,665
reason i started comedy bang bang he

444
00:17:23,665 --> 00:17:25,315
had to get up at three am

445
00:17:25,315 --> 00:17:26,935
or four am to do it yeah

446
00:17:26,935 --> 00:17:28,675
sounded awful yeah but no that sounds

447
00:17:28,675 --> 00:17:30,805
awful well that's why when when i

448
00:17:30,805 --> 00:17:32,875
would do comedy clubs and they would

449
00:17:32,875 --> 00:17:33,535
want you to

450
00:17:33,535 --> 00:17:36,775
to do the morning radio it's like

451
00:17:36,955 --> 00:17:39,475
i it does it doesn't make sense

452
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:40,975
first of all nobody goes to those

453
00:17:40,975 --> 00:17:42,745
shows because because they heard person they

454
00:17:42,745 --> 00:17:44,515
didn't know on the morning radio show

455
00:17:44,755 --> 00:17:46,675
yeah it was very funny but then

456
00:17:46,825 --> 00:17:49,765
also like it's cruel because i have

457
00:17:49,765 --> 00:17:51,565
a nighttime job and you have ah

458
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:52,795
you've made the choice to have this

459
00:17:52,825 --> 00:17:53,635
weird datetime

460
00:17:53,695 --> 00:17:55,405
job like they have nothing to do

461
00:17:55,405 --> 00:17:56,815
with each other's you're tying to all

462
00:17:56,815 --> 00:17:57,445
of society

463
00:17:58,525 --> 00:18:00,925
you know maybe percent no morning radio

464
00:18:00,925 --> 00:18:03,385
people make it up like you just

465
00:18:03,385 --> 00:18:04,938
don't know i know but i guess

466
00:18:04,945 --> 00:18:07,285
that i'm saying the listeners when you're

467
00:18:07,345 --> 00:18:09,565

pre show

654
00:24:38,225 --> 00:24:40,616
they say the my point is what

655
00:24:40,805 --> 00:24:41,675
got me into this is that the

656
00:24:41,675 --> 00:24:43,775
parents are divorced they're both parents are

657
00:24:43,775 --> 00:24:44,885
now divorced yes which is why i

658
00:24:44,885 --> 00:24:46,265
love it because they're have the the

659
00:24:46,265 --> 00:24:48,395
stories are more intense because they're both

660
00:24:48,395 --> 00:24:50,495
dating people there but people doing both

661
00:24:50,525 --> 00:24:52,145
average height which i just find interesting

662
00:24:52,535 --> 00:24:54,095
so they both were like i'm not

663
00:24:54,095 --> 00:24:55,561
satisfied with this i want you that

664
00:24:55,561 --> 00:24:56,735
you could see them through the years

665
00:24:56,735 --> 00:24:57,485
hating each

666
00:24:57,515 --> 00:24:59,825
other no wow well they just have

667
00:24:59,825 --> 00:25:01,205
been together forever and they started fighting

668
00:25:01,265 --> 00:25:02,525
doesn't happen with people who have been

669
00:25:02,525 --> 00:25:04,505
together forever necessarily but it did for

670
00:25:04,505 --> 00:25:06,095
them and it was like watching them

671
00:25:06,095 --> 00:25:07,895
fight it was like crazy but then

672
00:25:07,895 --> 00:25:09,245
finally to know okay they are getting

673
00:25:09,245 --> 00:25:10,535
divorced they do hate each other like

674
00:25:10,535 --> 00:25:12,005
it was like validating as a viewer

675
00:25:12,335 --> 00:25:14,495
and then now they're kind of making

676
00:25:14,495 --> 00:25:15,725
it work with trying to figure out

677
00:25:15,725 --> 00:25:17,375
where they can really live to like

678
00:25:17,375 --> 00:25:17,645
both

679
00:25:17,675 --> 00:25:18,845

when we were oh yeah most of

738
00:27:09,695 --> 00:27:13,685

for people to make a written statement

797
00:29:19,145 --> 00:29:21,815
sound natural zone like commerce sound not

00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:36,360
i kind of wish i didn't already

949
00:34:37,470 --> 00:34:39,210
i wish i didn't know so many

950
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:41,700
bad things about the world i think

951
00:34:41,910 --> 00:34:43,530
this is gonna be too dark probably

952
00:34:43,530 --> 00:34:46,560
but like i remember really learning and

953
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:50,250
understanding about molestation and i know i'm

954
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:52,110
sorry but i remember like learn was

955
00:34:52,110 --> 00:34:53,790
at an oprah like actually there were

956
00:34:53,794 --> 00:34:56,520
so many horrible stories or were exposed

957
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:57,540
to me probably edit

958
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:59,250
too young even just like as a

959
00:34:59,250 --> 00:35:01,350
teenager things i didn't really understand about

960
00:35:01,350 --> 00:35:02,940
things that happen people and i don't

961
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:05,160
know and i i feel that i

962
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:06,210
like then i do like a deep

963
00:35:06,210 --> 00:35:07,830
dive like wanting to understand those types

964
00:35:07,830 --> 00:35:10,080
of stories and like reading like memoirs

965
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,250
from people and all these hips things

966
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,750
and now it's so in my head

967
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:15,030
that it makes me feel sick and

968
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:16,650
thinking about that happened people makes me

969
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:17,790
so sad that i

970
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:19,410
i truly wish i didn't know so

971
00:35:19,410 --> 00:35:21,180
much about that watch the whole thing

972
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:24,510
about about cheat oprah interviewed child molesters

973
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:26,760
who were who were molesters and she

974
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:28,560
interviewed them and they talked about their

975
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:31,170
process for like the grooming children to

976
00:35:31,290 --> 00:35:33,690
don't them but i think show i

977
00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:36,270
hate knowing that but does it are

978
00:35:36,270 --> 00:35:37,920
you able to a i mean

979
00:35:38,826 --> 00:35:40,380
i guess were you able to protect

980
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:42,270
yourself and those types of situation i

981
00:35:42,270 --> 00:35:45,060
was too old to have you attractive

982
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:48,360
to have that be something that i

983
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:50,100
could write be so but do you

984
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:52,350
think that it will help out ah

985
00:35:52,410 --> 00:35:54,420
if you ever have children yeah i

986
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:55,710
do think so but i think i'm

987
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:59,130
so worried about that for a videotape

988
00:35:59,130 --> 00:36:00,990
you'll just show them they don't listen

989
00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:02,880
to guys like this um but like

990
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,590
i feel so concerned about that for

991
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:06,270
all children in the world that like

992
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:08,880
yeah yeah it's almost incapacitating in a

993
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,710
way yeah just like if these horrors

994
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:12,540
are going on yeah how can i

995
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:15,090
experience any joy myself yeah or like

996
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:16,710
not knowing that that's happening to somebody

997
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:18,270
because so often you don't know until

998
00:36:18,270 --> 00:36:20,880
someone's an adult and then that's devastating

999
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,680
so i don't know well the horrors

1000
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:23,640
of the world

1001
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:26,310
you know when you're confronted with them

1002
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:29,160
it's like difficult to find any joy

1003
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:31,380
but it's sort of figuring out that

1004
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:32,550
balance i guess if like i don't

1005
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:35,130
want to be you know sleeping through

1006
00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:36,720
life where i'm just right my life

1007
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,640
is happy i don't care i know

1008
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:41,430
but well the idea of of you

1009
00:36:41,430 --> 00:36:44,010
know when people say i wouldn't want

1010
00:36:44,010 --> 00:36:44,910
to bring a child into

1011
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:47,610
to this world it's i mean on

1012
00:36:47,610 --> 00:36:49,740
the one hand yeah i get what

1013
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:51,150
that argument is but on the other

1014
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:54,060
hand there's a lot that is great

1015
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:55,530
about being alive and being in the

1016
00:36:55,530 --> 00:36:57,900
yeah you know and you never know

1017
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:00,390
what an individual's experience is going to

1018
00:37:00,390 --> 00:37:02,700
be it's like it's a gamble no

1019
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:04,410
matter what i mean well yeah i've

1020
00:37:04,410 --> 00:37:05,040
been having this

1021
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:05,910
thought that i don't know if i'll

1022
00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:07,200
be able to articulate because it's so

1023
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,030
it's kind of just like it's ah

1024
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,260
it falls in the category like a

1025
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:12,270
stone thought but it's none when i

1026
00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:14,760
was thinking but i'm just i was

1027
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,290
thinking oh but i am really high

1028
00:37:16,290 --> 00:37:17,550
right now so hard where i got

1029
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:19,200
yeah well when we get high for

1030
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,330
every episode yeah but i was thinking

1031
00:37:21,330 --> 00:37:23,010
about how when i was a kid

1032
00:37:23,310 --> 00:37:25,230
i had the idea that all

1033
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:27,132
all adults were like always adults and

1034
00:37:27,132 --> 00:37:27,930
it was very hard for me to

1035
00:37:27,930 --> 00:37:29,490
wrap my head around the idea that

1036
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:31,500
people were all children at one point

1037
00:37:32,010 --> 00:37:33,960
and even now i think i'm still

1038
00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:37,320
understanding the fact that like everyone's getting

1039
00:37:37,350 --> 00:37:39,120
older and they're experiencing that for the

1040
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:41,130
first time it's not like everyone is

1041
00:37:41,130 --> 00:37:43,020
just older and they know everything you

1042
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:44,610
know what i'm trying to say i

1043
00:37:44,610 --> 00:37:45,390
do ok and

1044
00:37:45,427 --> 00:37:46,770
then i think about kids and i'm

1045
00:37:46,770 --> 00:37:49,170
like oh god like when you have

1046
00:37:49,170 --> 00:37:51,240
a kid it creates this person who

1047
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:53,280
like has all of their own feelings

1048
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,380
and experiences and they just go through

1049
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:58,590
life completely autonomous of you and everything

1050
00:37:58,770 --> 00:38:00,990
that you've experienced and then that makes

1051
00:38:00,990 --> 00:38:02,220
me feel crazy i don't know i

1052
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:03,330
don't even have a full point to

1053
00:38:03,330 --> 00:38:05,160
that it's more just like the thought

1054
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:05,550
that ever

1055
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:07,440
everyone is experiencing life for the first

1056
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:10,770
time there are as many mean yeah

1057
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,570
lifetimes as there have been people

1058
00:38:13,890 --> 00:38:14,070
what

1059
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:18,300
we need to talk for him to

1060
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:19,890
argue with we need to take a

1061
00:38:19,890 --> 00:38:20,610
break we'll be right back

1062
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:28,140
we're back hello i was thinking about

1063
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:31,080
life ah how you know how movies

1064
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:35,010
um they pretty much like all movies

1065
00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:37,530
are based upon star wars predicated upon

1066
00:38:37,530 --> 00:38:38,730
star wars know they're all based on

1067
00:38:38,730 --> 00:38:40,710
happily ever after right every movie ends

1068
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:41,790
on happily ever after

1069
00:38:41,790 --> 00:38:44,790
or if they're a tragedy tragedy wrapped

1070
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,410
yeah but you know what i mean

1071
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:48,240
they're they're all they'll they'll add two

1072
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,940
basic stories and like at the point

1073
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:53,040
where it's like and everything worked out

1074
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:55,590
or and that everything was horrible forever

1075
00:38:55,590 --> 00:38:58,350
but like really lifetimes if you if

1076
00:38:58,350 --> 00:38:59,610
you were to make them into a

1077
00:38:59,610 --> 00:39:01,950
movie it would be like eh

1078
00:39:01,950 --> 00:39:03,510
anything's really interesting and then the movie

1079
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:06,180
just ends because the person died accidentally

1080
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:09,660
or like everything is so great happily

1081
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:11,820
ever after and then just like you

1082
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:14,430
know fifty years of boredom and then

1083
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,740
you know there's a lifetime movie channel

1084
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,200
is that what they say that's what

1085
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,720
those movies that's okay check this out

1086
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:23,700
how many people out there do you

1087
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:26,730
think are like really bored all the

1088
00:39:26,730 --> 00:39:29,820
time all the time oh god oh

1089
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:32,310
i think that people know i don't

1090
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:33,600
i don't think i think that that's

1091
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:37,140
something that artists tend to think about

1092
00:39:37,170 --> 00:39:38,910
idea i don't give a flying but

1093
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:40,830
i don't even assume that about people

1094
00:39:40,830 --> 00:39:42,270
i just need legal or actual

1095
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:45,150
the people who are like what's life

1096
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:46,650
i think even if people hate their

1097
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:51,870
jobs they've they find ah wonderful things

1098
00:39:51,870 --> 00:39:53,850
in their family and in their you

1099
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:55,710
know out of their job experience yeah

1100
00:39:55,710 --> 00:39:57,630
i think i think you know people

1101
00:39:57,660 --> 00:39:59,610
people all for the most part they

1102
00:40:00,390 --> 00:40:02,430
they really enjoy what's going on you

1103
00:40:02,430 --> 00:40:05,910
no i agree i i like to

1104
00:40:05,910 --> 00:40:07,110
think of it that way i just

1105
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:08,962
imagine that there are that isn't people

1106
00:40:08,962 --> 00:40:10,170
i guess i'm talking about the privileged

1107
00:40:10,170 --> 00:40:11,640
people who live in this country are

1108
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:14,730
well-off and yeah i mean yeah there's

1109
00:40:14,730 --> 00:40:17,190
definitely a line but i mean i'm

1110
00:40:17,190 --> 00:40:20,280
just thinking about people who like have

1111
00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:22,501
who are just like retired and they're

1112
00:40:22,501 --> 00:40:22,590
like

1113
00:40:22,590 --> 00:40:25,500
like seventy and they're just like bored

1114
00:40:25,650 --> 00:40:27,510
yeah like i think there are people

1115
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:30,570
who are actually like unfulfilled and they

1116
00:40:30,570 --> 00:40:32,610
cannot find it i think i think

1117
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,140
i don't want to make for sure

1118
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:35,490
there are people that are unfulfilled i

1119
00:40:35,490 --> 00:40:37,950
mean i i think about

1120
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:43,440
your experience of retirement was my best

1121
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,360
experience of retirement was you retired

1122
00:40:47,430 --> 00:40:49,230
is that why we're all here three

1123
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:50,970

1125
00:40:56,730 --> 00:40:59,790
my ah my mother-in-law and her husband

1126
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:03,630
when they were both retired they were

1127
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:05,460
traveling and they were just spending time

1128
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:07,200
with each other and they were so

1129
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,480
awesome but they were like extremely devoted

1130
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:10,770
to each other they loved to just

1131
00:41:10,770 --> 00:41:11,670
being together

1132
00:41:12,090 --> 00:41:13,890
and it was fucking great and it

1133
00:41:13,890 --> 00:41:15,450
made me feel so good like oh

1134
00:41:15,450 --> 00:41:16,560
my god that's a thing to look

1135
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:18,810
forward to you know in their in

1136
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:20,850
their twilight years that they're having this

1137
00:41:20,850 --> 00:41:23,520
wonderful time just being together yeah i

1138
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,500
don't know that i'll ever retire i

1139
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:26,790
want to be like betty why can't

1140
00:41:26,790 --> 00:41:29,070
imagine that either yeah imagine retirement but

1141
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:30,870
i can't imagine a time when you

1142
00:41:30,870 --> 00:41:31,830
know i'm older and i

1143
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:34,830
i i'm not working as much yeah

1144
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:37,080
okay yeah there's always some is telling

1145
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:39,450
me there's there for you wow yeah

1146
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:40,980
but they're also currently there's just so

1147
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:42,900
many excuses not to do things like

1148
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:44,940
wow we can't really do that because

1149
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:46,440
this is coming up and we can't

1150
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:47,670
really fit it into the thing you

1151
00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:49,650
know yeah that i look forward to

1152
00:41:49,650 --> 00:41:50,820
a time where it's just like hey

1153
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:51,990
we got i have sick

1154
00:41:51,990 --> 00:41:52,890
x months where i don't have to

1155
00:41:52,890 --> 00:41:54,900
do anything yes i do this i

1156
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:56,640
think what i mean because retirement is

1157
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,740
not for a lot of people it's

1158
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:02,640
like the way things are now it's

1159
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:04,860
it's pushed farther and farther away yeah

1160
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:06,720
where people have to work much longer

1161
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,123
than they used to and we social

1162
00:42:08,123 --> 00:42:10,500
security maybe going away she's just god

1163
00:42:10,530 --> 00:42:12,090
yeah going to be horrible i guess

1164
00:42:12,270 --> 00:42:13,380
for me it was

1165
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:17,640
you don't necessarily have to find a

1166
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:19,710
you know a bunch of a million

1167
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:22,260
things to fill your time you know

1168
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:24,390
it could just be that you're you're

1169
00:42:24,390 --> 00:42:26,760
leading a quieter life than you did

1170
00:42:26,970 --> 00:42:28,380
and you get to be if if

1171
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:29,430
you're lucky you get to be with

1172
00:42:29,430 --> 00:42:31,830
someone that you love being with and

1173
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:33,750
that sounds like a look like a

1174
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:34,650
very nice life to me

1175
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:38,730
yeah when my dad retired i think

1176
00:42:38,730 --> 00:42:41,190
he was looking for stuff to do

1177
00:42:41,190 --> 00:42:43,680
so he started like a fishing fly

1178
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:46,230
business yeah this can happen a lot

1179
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:47,610
though that people are immediately like oh

1180
00:42:47,610 --> 00:42:49,080
i need something i need something well

1181
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:50,550
i mean yeah every you know i

1182
00:42:50,550 --> 00:42:51,900
don't know life is just what you're

1183
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:52,950
doing while you're trying to go to

1184
00:42:52,950 --> 00:42:54,480

1185
00:42:54,870 --> 00:42:59,100
i mean yeah it's like god i

1186
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:01,260
just woke up i can't sleep for

1187
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:03,930
another fourteen hours that's the most depressing

1188
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:06,060
way to think about okay what do

1189
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:08,160
i do during these fourteen hours i

1190
00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:11,730
are you do you love sleep i

1191
00:43:12,510 --> 00:43:14,489
when it's good it's fucking know a

1192
00:43:14,489 --> 00:43:15,030
good night's sleep

1193
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:16,170

1194
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:18,300
my sleep lately has been really really

1195
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:20,760
good but i don't relish sleep in

1196
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:23,670
that way janey loves sleep she loves

1197
00:43:23,670 --> 00:43:25,530
sleeping yeah she loves it and she's

1198
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:27,330
very good at it one time she

1199
00:43:27,330 --> 00:43:29,340
said one time she said

1200
00:43:30,570 --> 00:43:32,580
i what we were talking about like

1201
00:43:32,580 --> 00:43:34,380
she slept late she sleeps later than

1202
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:36,630
i do usually lately we're in lower

1203
00:43:36,630 --> 00:43:38,370
kind of like the flops and i'm

1204
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:40,770
i'm i was surprised when that turn

1205
00:43:40,783 --> 00:43:42,660
started happening where i would be in

1206
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:45,420
bed law after her right um but

1207
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:48,060
one time she slept like for a

1208
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:50,550
long time and she said

1209
00:43:50,550 --> 00:43:53,040
yeah i wish i could just sleep

1210
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:54,960
and sleep and sleep and never wake

1211
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:57,420
up and i say honey that's death

1212
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:00,630
and she said i know

1213
00:44:02,430 --> 00:44:04,488
um and that's why

1214
00:44:05,190 --> 00:44:08,580
ah sleep i like sleeping um but

1215
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:10,620
i i i do feel like a

1216
00:44:10,620 --> 00:44:12,030
little i wish we didn't have to

1217
00:44:12,030 --> 00:44:14,580

1218
00:44:14,580 --> 00:44:17,070

wish we could sleep when we wanted

1221
00:44:20,820 --> 00:44:22,770
to and for as long as we

1222
00:44:22,770 --> 00:44:24,750
want to do like you could program

1223
00:44:24,750 --> 00:44:25,110
it yeah

1224
00:44:25,110 --> 00:44:27,240

1225
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:29,100

1226
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:31,470
pm to nine pm yeah and just

1227
00:44:31,470 --> 00:44:33,240
do that i wish we didn't have

1228
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:35,820
to do it because out but during

1229
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:37,080
the time that we would be sleeping

1230
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:39,570
we would be constantly shitting would you

1231
00:44:39,570 --> 00:44:41,760
want that lord i cut you off

1232
00:44:41,910 --> 00:44:42,990
you say i was gonna say the

1233
00:44:42,990 --> 00:44:44,070
same thing okay

1234
00:44:45,330 --> 00:44:46,830
no i wish we just didn't have

1235
00:44:46,830 --> 00:44:48,150
to sleep we had energy and we

1236
00:44:48,150 --> 00:44:49,740
just i mean think of how like

1237
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:51,630
a third of your life is gone

1238
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:55,200
i hate thinking about that it's gone

1239
00:44:55,230 --> 00:44:56,970
yeah but that's true for everyone so

1240
00:44:56,970 --> 00:44:59,100
it's like i never existed well that's

1241
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:01,230
true it's almost like yeah everyone the

1242
00:45:01,230 --> 00:45:02,850
playing field that's true

1243
00:45:04,110 --> 00:45:05,730
but i guess that's the argument for

1244
00:45:05,730 --> 00:45:07,020
people who are like i only sleep

1245
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:08,490
four hours yeah but then those people

1246
00:45:08,490 --> 00:45:11,010
like aren't well yeah like yeah there's

1247
00:45:11,010 --> 00:45:12,720
like no way to actually be functioning

1248
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:14,640
on that little did you you follow

1249
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:16,500

1287
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:28,950

1288
00:46:29,042 --> 00:46:30,480
my job where they're like you know

what go nap for a half hour

1290
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:33,543
because it changes the environment for everyone

1291
00:46:33,543 --> 00:46:35,070
looks so good in school when i

1292
00:46:35,070 --> 00:46:36,180
think of myself in high school i

1293
00:46:36,180 --> 00:46:37,590
was the most tired of ever been

1294
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:39,270
well unlike you know i couldn't believe

1295
00:46:39,270 --> 00:46:40,980
my dad once said to me he

1296
00:46:40,980 --> 00:46:42,780
was like you know what i used

1297
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:45,180
to get on you about sleeping late

1298
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:46,560
and how you were it was just

1299
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:48,090
so terrible to try to wake you

1300
00:46:48,090 --> 00:46:48,900
up you know when you had to

1301
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:49,110
go to

1302
00:46:49,110 --> 00:46:51,000
school or church or whatever but now

1303
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:53,190
studies show that ah you know in

1304
00:46:53,190 --> 00:46:55,020
the teenage years to early twenties or

1305
00:46:55,022 --> 00:46:57,150
something that your bodies are meant to

1306
00:46:57,150 --> 00:46:58,590
be like a sleep until a law

1307
00:46:58,650 --> 00:47:01,140
firm or remember my mom screaming at

1308
00:47:01,140 --> 00:47:02,430
me or just make me feel so

1309
00:47:02,430 --> 00:47:03,900
bad for sleeping late and like the

1310
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:05,370
summer when i was like eleven o'clock

1311
00:47:05,370 --> 00:47:07,410
and i like hello hello

1312
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:11,040
i remember how hard it was to

1313
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:13,472
wake up it was painful so hard

1314
00:47:13,472 --> 00:47:15,000
and so my dad would throw water

1315
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,130
on me let's say he was get

1316
00:47:17,130 --> 00:47:19,200
like you get a tale of honor

1317
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:21,600
st louis he's he was from the

a boy no i mean i don't

1320
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:27,270

00:47:27,270 --> 00:47:28,230
of like he never had

1322
00:47:28,230 --> 00:47:30,001
had a life where he could wear

1323
00:47:30,001 --> 00:47:31,830
a basketball wasn't being bounced at his

1324
00:47:31,830 --> 00:47:33,420
face mine was like my mom would

1325
00:47:33,450 --> 00:47:35,070

right because it was like you were

1344
00:48:11,340 --> 00:48:13,222
in high school when you join yeah

1345
00:48:13,230 --> 00:48:16,800

00:57:08,125 --> 00:57:10,615
whom ken ober uber from from remote

1594
00:57:10,615 --> 00:57:11,875
control data for awhile and then when

1595
00:57:11,875 --> 00:57:12,265

1596
00:57:12,595 --> 00:57:14,635
marc cohen or good friend marcos was

1597

the host i did it under both

1598
00:57:15,925 --> 00:57:18,595
regime oh yeah right yeah um have

1599
00:57:18,595 --> 00:57:20,275
you ever been interested in hosting game

1600
00:57:20,275 --> 00:57:22,165
show i would do i love game

1601
00:57:22,165 --> 00:57:23,755
shows you would jump hand i mean

1602
00:57:23,845 --> 00:57:26,365
i've i've tried to create a few

1603
00:57:26,425 --> 00:57:28,345
yeah still like trying to develop one

1604
00:57:28,405 --> 00:57:29,575
it's tough but it's a thing that's

1605
00:57:29,575 --> 00:57:31,375
come up over the years i might

1606
00:57:31,375 --> 00:57:32,425
be more inclined to do it now

1607
00:57:32,455 --> 00:57:33,985
i don't know the problem of the

1608
00:57:34,015 --> 00:57:36,565
of hosting the game show is if

1609
00:57:36,565 --> 00:57:38,455
it's like a regular straight-up network game

1610
00:57:38,455 --> 00:57:38,935
show

1611
00:57:40,255 --> 00:57:41,815
the job is mostly like the heavy

1612
00:57:41,815 --> 00:57:43,878
lifting of explaining the game yeah right

1613
00:57:43,885 --> 00:57:45,055
and i was like saying the sun

1614
00:57:45,085 --> 00:57:46,435
would that over and over but like

1615
00:57:46,435 --> 00:57:47,635
if you do it like dick clark

1616
00:57:47,635 --> 00:57:49,585
or steve harvey like there's fun to

1617
00:57:49,585 --> 00:57:51,535
be had while steve harvey's having a

1618
00:57:51,535 --> 00:57:53,741
great time he's i like watching him

1619
00:57:53,875 --> 00:57:55,675
he doesn't get so upset with people

1620
00:57:55,675 --> 00:57:58,975
saying um um who is just going

1621
00:57:58,975 --> 00:58:00,265
to say oh i always think

1622
00:58:00,295 --> 00:58:02,125
in the other night why didn't i

1623
00:58:02,155 --> 00:58:05,395
create the proposal the worst oh i

1624
00:58:05,395 --> 00:58:06,505
want to talk to you i almost

1625
00:58:06,505 --> 00:58:08,545
texted you oh my god you watch

1626
00:58:08,545 --> 00:58:10,615
it i watched it and it's the

1627
00:58:10,615 --> 00:58:12,835
first episode is like they picked the

1628
00:58:12,835 --> 00:58:14,455
worst one to start with it was

1629
00:58:14,455 --> 00:58:16,015
crazy maybe it's the best one no

1630
00:58:16,045 --> 00:58:17,635
way the proposal works is this new

1631
00:58:17,635 --> 00:58:18,655
show that comes on right after the

1632
00:58:18,655 --> 00:58:20,425
bachelor and it's a per

1633
00:58:20,425 --> 00:58:22,315
person who wants to get married is

1634
00:58:22,317 --> 00:58:24,195
behind a shroud there's twenty

1635
00:58:25,263 --> 00:58:27,985
right there behind you like a shroud

1636
00:58:27,985 --> 00:58:29,706
of turin a wall it was a

1637
00:58:29,706 --> 00:58:32,035
shroud i think shroud is something that

1638
00:58:32,035 --> 00:58:33,685
goes around you like a curtain you

1639
00:58:33,685 --> 00:58:35,335
mean yeah but they were hiding something

1640
00:58:35,365 --> 00:58:38,395
yeah right and then this there's a

1641
00:58:38,395 --> 00:58:39,535
whole bunch of women who kind of

1642
00:58:39,535 --> 00:58:42,145
do this horrible miss america ask pageant

1643
00:58:42,145 --> 00:58:44,245
where some episodes it's men for yes

1644
00:58:44,275 --> 00:58:45,385
but in this first one was

1645
00:58:45,415 --> 00:58:46,705
a man and then all women have

1646
00:58:46,705 --> 00:58:48,145
been twenty women who come out and

1647
00:58:48,145 --> 00:58:49,615
then they and then and they say

1648
00:58:49,615 --> 00:58:51,445
like little facts about themselves i think

1649
00:58:51,445 --> 00:58:54,235
they're meanies sometimes yeah and that was

1650
00:58:54,235 --> 00:58:55,735
really weird because they're all not used

1651
00:58:55,735 --> 00:58:56,785
to that it's not like miss america

1652
00:58:56,785 --> 00:58:58,465
where they've been practicing yeah no they're

1653
00:58:58,465 --> 00:58:59,455
all like i have to be in

1654
00:58:59,455 --> 00:59:01,187
a bikini and they're going to like

1655
00:59:01,187 --> 00:59:03,655
they're kind of like old day uncomfortable

1656
00:59:03,685 --> 00:59:05,545
yeah and then then

1657
00:59:05,545 --> 00:59:06,595
i'm like there's a point where the

1658
00:59:06,625 --> 00:59:08,365
guy behind the thing goes like and

1659
00:59:08,365 --> 00:59:11,395
are you comfortable marrying ah a um

1660
00:59:11,425 --> 00:59:14,125
an amputee because he lost a limb

1661
00:59:14,245 --> 00:59:16,045
and then what by the way i

1662
00:59:16,315 --> 00:59:18,745
the prize for these women is to

1663
00:59:19,045 --> 00:59:22,045
marry a police officer from bakersfield ways

1664
00:59:22,045 --> 00:59:23,905
like so like you could get that

1665
00:59:23,935 --> 00:59:25,285
girl go to a bar

1666
00:59:25,795 --> 00:59:28,225
you could meet him yeah night and

1667
00:59:28,225 --> 00:59:29,005
then it's the one thing i have

1668
00:59:29,005 --> 00:59:30,895
to say is it was it was

1669
00:59:30,895 --> 00:59:33,529
more regular people than the bachelor totally

1670
00:59:33,745 --> 00:59:35,665
i did were pretty normal are pretty

1671
00:59:35,665 --> 00:59:37,705
normal looking and it was like flooring

1672
00:59:37,735 --> 00:59:39,205
to me actually because because i was

1673
00:59:39,205 --> 00:59:41,275
like wait this these are not models

1674
00:59:41,275 --> 00:59:43,555
who are trying to like gain you

1675
00:59:43,555 --> 00:59:45,205
know fame after this these are like

1676
00:59:45,205 --> 00:59:45,865
kind of regular

1677
00:59:45,865 --> 00:59:47,035
or people who are looking for a

1678
00:59:47,035 --> 00:59:48,685
regular person but they didn't live in

1679
00:59:48,685 --> 00:59:50,725
the same city so how's it and

1680
00:59:51,205 --> 00:59:53,185
the end they the man proposes to

1681
00:59:53,185 --> 00:59:54,625
the one he chooses and then there's

1682
00:59:54,625 --> 00:59:57,235
no follow-up no and then there is

1683
00:59:57,235 --> 00:59:58,495
a little bit of a video we

1684
00:59:58,645 --> 00:59:59,665
just say well i didn't see it

1685
00:59:59,665 --> 01:00:01,195
i see the answer so yeah there

1686
01:00:01,315 --> 01:00:03,235
you see they're still together okay you

1687
01:00:03,235 --> 01:00:05,425
see the answer but nobody is so

1688
01:00:05,425 --> 01:00:06,025
weird because they're like

1689
01:00:06,025 --> 01:00:08,155
why do you act as though they

1690
01:00:08,155 --> 01:00:09,265
really are in love with the person

1691
01:00:09,265 --> 01:00:10,855
like like you're the third person i've

1692
01:00:10,855 --> 01:00:12,109
been looking for like i know and

1693
01:00:12,115 --> 01:00:13,675
it's like yeah have so little information

1694
01:00:13,675 --> 01:00:15,235
about this person because this is not

1695
01:00:15,235 --> 01:00:17,695
like the bachelor where they spend all

1696
01:00:17,695 --> 01:00:19,195
this time they spent canals week which

1697
01:00:19,195 --> 01:00:21,955
is already ridiculously social this is literally

1698
01:00:21,955 --> 01:00:24,685
like twenty minutes yeah they've had twenty

1699
01:00:24,685 --> 01:00:26,097
minutes i mean it's an hour but

1700
01:00:26,097 --> 01:00:26,185

1701
01:00:26,185 --> 01:00:27,355

1702
01:00:27,415 --> 01:00:28,615
each the man is talking to each

1703
01:00:28,615 --> 01:00:30,505
woman for a total of five minutes

1704
