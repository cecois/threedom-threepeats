was an art house movie theater at

558
00:20:58,565 --> 00:20:58,925
the time

559
00:20:59,285 --> 00:21:00,845
wasn't like going to the art house

560
00:21:00,845 --> 00:21:02,135
movie theater so cool when you were

561
00:21:02,135 --> 00:21:03,815
young abs yes like it was like

562
00:21:03,815 --> 00:21:05,345
wow i'm seeing a movie that a

563
00:21:05,345 --> 00:21:06,605
lot of people don't even know even

564
00:21:06,635 --> 00:21:08,435
as a thing we've done in san

565
00:21:08,435 --> 00:21:10,415
luis obispo very smart yeah san louis

566
00:21:10,415 --> 00:21:11,765
obispo when i was in college and

567
00:21:11,765 --> 00:21:14,105
it was like we would just go

568
00:21:14,105 --> 00:21:15,455
there everywhere i mean that was that

569
00:21:15,455 --> 00:21:17,525
was when our you know independent films

570
00:21:17,525 --> 00:21:19,085
too were like huge time

571
00:21:19,235 --> 00:21:20,705
it was like you know what i

572
00:21:20,765 --> 00:21:22,385
what i find very comforting about those

573
00:21:22,625 --> 00:21:23,975
movie theaters is that they all have

574
00:21:23,975 --> 00:21:25,445
the exact they show the exact same

575
00:21:25,445 --> 00:21:27,395
movies right so like you'll always see

576
00:21:27,395 --> 00:21:29,075
a double feature of a hard day's

577
00:21:29,075 --> 00:21:32,705
night with the monkeys head like that's

578
00:21:32,705 --> 00:21:34,535
always there as your tear raised her

579
00:21:34,535 --> 00:21:36,965
head yeah with head why was it

580
00:21:37,355 --> 00:21:39,185
oh why did the eraser movie

581
00:21:39,275 --> 00:21:40,715
and head why did the beatles make

582
00:21:40,805 --> 00:21:41,977
they made a couple of movies why

583
00:21:41,977 --> 00:21:43,385
do they do that though they do

584
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:47,255
that because people like debido well guess

585
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:48,605
because people don't get to see them

586
00:21:48,605 --> 00:21:50,495
that much without the internet yeah and

587
00:21:50,495 --> 00:21:51,395
so it'd be like a way to

588
00:21:51,485 --> 00:21:53,285
get own them the movies are actually

589
00:21:53,285 --> 00:21:55,445
pretty funny and fun they have like

590
00:21:55,505 --> 00:21:56,825
lines and stuff i kind of always

591
00:21:57,095 --> 00:21:58,595
being more like music video there no

592
00:21:58,595 --> 00:21:59,345
silly i

593
00:21:59,405 --> 00:22:00,395
could i get a lot of em

594
00:22:00,395 --> 00:22:01,925
i can't tell whether they're sort of

595
00:22:01,925 --> 00:22:03,935
improving but i know they're scripted because

596
00:22:03,935 --> 00:22:05,525
they're too funny yeah you know what

597
00:22:05,525 --> 00:22:06,755

603
00:22:16,205 --> 00:22:18,845
time with like the the there's like

604
00:22:18,845 --> 00:22:19,565

very experimental it's very of it's two-tier

611
00:22:32,765 --> 00:22:35,375
to watch arnold schwarzenegger's eraser and head

612
00:22:35,375 --> 00:22:36,335

with this shoes he was like coached

665
00:24:40,892 --> 00:24:42,305

666
00:24:42,305 --> 00:24:43,985
he already hits and he was approached

667
00:24:43,985 --> 00:24:45,215
by a guy like hey while you're

668
00:24:45,215 --> 00:24:47,105
there could you tape recorded but yeah

669
00:24:47,615 --> 00:24:50,315
i'm a secret concert taper yeah and

670
00:24:50,315 --> 00:24:52,265
so he was just an old-fashioned with

671
00:24:52,265 --> 00:24:53,795
an old-fashioned reel to reel i think

672
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:55,205
that was a real reason it was

673
00:24:55,505 --> 00:24:57,605
okay it was yeah but it was

674
00:24:57,605 --> 00:24:59,165
one of those boxy shape

675
00:24:59,195 --> 00:25:00,692
because people had their homes so we

676
00:25:00,692 --> 00:25:02,435
had to wear a trenchcoat over it

677
00:25:03,035 --> 00:25:06,005
but he he loved the the doobie

678
00:25:06,005 --> 00:25:07,805
brothers doobie brothers were so good that

679
00:25:07,805 --> 00:25:09,365
he had to do the rerun dance

680
00:25:09,365 --> 00:25:10,565
which if you'll remember it was sort

681
00:25:10,565 --> 00:25:12,905
of like this i see listener image

682
00:25:12,905 --> 00:25:14,855
of it and then the tape recorder

683
00:25:14,855 --> 00:25:16,535
fell out and spilled out right in

684
00:25:16,535 --> 00:25:18,095
front of the doobie brothers yes and

685
00:25:18,095 --> 00:25:19,325
then all went

686
00:25:19,355 --> 00:25:20,465
to the edge by the way they're

687
00:25:20,465 --> 00:25:23,675
playing a tiny tiny venue right and

688
00:25:23,675 --> 00:25:24,785
i guess it was their old high

689
00:25:24,785 --> 00:25:27,035
school or some oh okay yeah i

690
00:25:27,035 --> 00:25:28,025
don't know if we're supposed to think

691
00:25:28,025 --> 00:25:29,525
they were all literal brothers

692
00:25:31,235 --> 00:25:32,315
they were a family that went to

693
00:25:32,315 --> 00:25:34,077
this so funny but they all moved

694
00:25:34,077 --> 00:25:34,835
to the edge of the stage all

695
00:25:34,835 --> 00:25:36,815
pointing at the border on the ground

696
00:25:36,845 --> 00:25:38,285
didn't they come by wherever they used

697
00:25:38,285 --> 00:25:39,665
to hang out the next day to

698
00:25:39,665 --> 00:25:41,225
talk to re-run about why that's wrong

699
00:25:41,255 --> 00:25:42,995
yeah yeah yeah it was a rerun

700
00:25:43,025 --> 00:25:44,975
why was his name re-run it was

701
00:25:44,975 --> 00:25:46,745
that before they had reruns of tv

702
00:25:46,745 --> 00:25:47,225
shows

703
00:25:49,325 --> 00:25:51,755
they didn't have the technology to re-run

704
00:25:51,755 --> 00:25:53,975
television shows until we're eighty nine a

705
00:25:54,005 --> 00:25:57,575
class that i runs i think it's

706
00:25:57,575 --> 00:26:00,065
a serious question okay let's look at

707
00:26:00,065 --> 00:26:02,195
temperature we're all we're all very upset

708
00:26:03,935 --> 00:26:05,765
it's called what i think you if

709
00:26:05,795 --> 00:26:08,705
if memory serves he was in some

710
00:26:08,705 --> 00:26:09,995
kind of dance crew and that was

711
00:26:09,995 --> 00:26:11,615
like his dance name and then it

712
00:26:11,615 --> 00:26:13,415
just carried over into the shot was

713
00:26:13,445 --> 00:26:15,365
it based on the word rerun from

714
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:17,495
television shows being re yeah people did

715
00:26:17,495 --> 00:26:19,115
not invent the word rerun no i

716
00:26:19,115 --> 00:26:21,215
want i wondered if it meant something

717
00:26:21,215 --> 00:26:22,565
out i understand what you were wondering

718
00:26:23,195 --> 00:26:23,375
i

719
00:26:23,435 --> 00:26:25,145
do not know if it meant something

720
00:26:25,175 --> 00:26:27,747
else to him maybe it meant somebody

721
00:26:27,747 --> 00:26:29,795
else but reruns have been around since

722
00:26:29,825 --> 00:26:31,340
dammit like you'd be a kid and

723
00:26:31,369 --> 00:26:33,125
go on to re-write yes since the

724
00:26:33,125 --> 00:26:35,345
fifteenth probably since you were little

725
00:26:36,395 --> 00:26:38,105
since cool off because nothing better when

726
00:26:38,105 --> 00:26:39,395

727
00:26:39,395 --> 00:26:39,875
sky

728
00:26:40,955 --> 00:26:42,905
the reruns that took balls like the

729
00:26:42,905 --> 00:26:44,285
first time that the first time that

730
00:26:44,285 --> 00:26:45,335
ever have is like you know what

731
00:26:45,395 --> 00:26:46,295

732
00:26:46,295 --> 00:26:47,765
show you an old one and they

733
00:26:48,095 --> 00:26:49,895
paid off they didn't get any residual

734
00:26:49,895 --> 00:26:51,875
that's right yeah do you know the

735
00:26:51,875 --> 00:26:54,875

all we have is a bed it's

1340
00:48:15,065 --> 00:48:17,585
