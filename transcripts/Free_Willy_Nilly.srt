because i'll know we were playing we're

163
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,360
playing a guy it's so hard to

164
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,620

165
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:11,640
talked about on the show but we

166
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:14,850
were playing a game where where she

167
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,310
swapped out the first letter of a

168
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:18,990
word and pointed to body parts and

169
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:22,200
was like ah you know instead of

170
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,308
foot it would be like boots and

171
00:06:24,308 --> 00:06:25,200
the pieces would be like

172
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,160
zinus

173
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,580
but with the same guy which by

174
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:31,470
the way no but with the same

175
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,510
with the same letter each time so

176
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:35,160
then when she got to hard she

177
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,300

i'm sure it's going to happen very

290
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,710
readily and it'll just why do you

291
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:24,570
think that that that people shouldn't swear

292
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:25,770
in front of kids well i just

293
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:28,770
don't want ah the kid to say

294
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:31,530
swear words why you don't hear it

295
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:34,020
because because it's so foul it makes

296
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:35,160
my ears but it's so

297
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,320
so funny into it is funny but

to as long as they know the

301
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:43,080
rules of like these are words you

302
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,690
don't say in polite conversation or to

303
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:47,850
teachers or i just think it's like

304
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:48,900
i don't want it to be the

305
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:50,816

00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:52,350
to say like fuck i dropped my

something and out of tune or something

364
00:12:53,186 --> 00:12:54,450

00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:19,020
interesting work too

374
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:21,480
yeah sorry to ask you a second

375
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:24,540
follow up today but what what um

376
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:27,780
so at like have you planned out

377
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:30,450
conversations and at what ages you're gonna

378
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:32,730
have them with your like with mike

379
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:34,140
and stuff like that or like have

380
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:35,400
you talked about a lot of these

381
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,750
issues or is it kind of a

382
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:37,920
thing where you're like oh i'm just

383
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:38,910
going to take it as it goes

384
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:40,170
and will yeah talk about it

385
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:41,760
five minutes before to have a theory

386
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,620
take it as it goes mentality with

387
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:47,670
the entire situation um i mean parenting

388
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:48,480
situation

389
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:52,110
i mean i think like one thing

390
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:55,830
that's interesting is that just within our

391
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:57,900
relationship like sirte when certain things come

392
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,850
up i feel like like related to

393
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:00,420
parenting

394
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:03,630
we might have different opinions and then

395
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:05,280
it's like oh that's gonna be a

396
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,390
thing i guess when we have to

397
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:07,830
figure out that thing or whatever but

398
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:10,020
like it's nothing huge not like religion

399
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:12,660
or something but like ram just there

400
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:14,040
was some people have to figure that

401
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,350
out where it's like hey which church

402
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:17,910
or and and i'm assuming you're not

403
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:19,740
going to church we we i wasn't

404
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:21,120
going to start now i think is

405
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:21,720
the vibe

406
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:22,410
right

407
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:25,740
like well because okay fifteen probably a

408
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,568
great time i have some babies to

409
00:14:27,568 --> 00:14:30,810
no thinker no yes yes guess what

410
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:34,170
people think that ah that some people

411
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:36,630
think you know that ah you know

412
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:38,760
the the that kids need a baseline

413
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,110
of that of like to to know

414
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:41,587
what it is i think i don't

415
00:14:41,587 --> 00:14:43,140
and so even though they're not religious

416
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:43,800
they go like oh

417
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,970
i'll take you to church or whatever

418
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:48,150
tig family host yeah hosur that's what

419
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:49,830
that holes are you out i mean

420
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:51,240
i went to church enough times as

421
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,020
a kid that i feel like i

422
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:54,630
do have that like baseline understanding of

423
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:56,100
what churches and whether i want to

424
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:58,350
go or not ah body of christ

425
00:14:58,530 --> 00:14:59,580
yeah no but

426
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:04,560
but um i don't i like we

427
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,060
we both don't go to church so

428
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:07,680
it would be really like a stretch

429
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,430
to be like now i've got to

430
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:09,660
find a church so i can teach

431
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:10,920
the hint about what churches so they

432
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,060
can decide they don't want to go

433
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:15,480
later yeah right but i am open

434
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:18,090
to discussing religion and god and all

435
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:19,260
that kind of stuff i think that's

436
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:19,680
great

437
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:22,590
i just like when when your daughter

438
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:24,390
is three and says what happens when

439
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:26,370
we died you say nothing our brains

440
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:27,870
just turn i'd probably say you go

441
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:28,440
to heaven

442
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:32,808
really i went i will you tell

443
00:15:32,842 --> 00:15:35,070
the real truth i don't believe that

444
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:36,810
i don't believe that your brain turns

445
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:39,390
off and you just are nothing then

446
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:40,740
why are we burying people if their

447
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,510
brains are okay their brain i do

448
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:44,370
think i do think you don't function

449
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:46,890
as a person anymore but i think

450
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:47,790
you have a soul

451
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:51,330
okay there is an energy that animates

452
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:53,460
us that cannot be destroyed once we

453
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:55,500
die yeah i don't know if i

454
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:56,340
would just grab it that way how

455
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:59,310
many times telegraphic or six pounds sounds

456
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:01,830
holographic like sounds like a hologram

457
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:04,620
and that's what she meant that

458
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:08,280
um i don't know i i think

459
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:09,570
i kind of think everybody

460
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:13,620
i kind of think just everything shuts

461
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:16,290
down but um but who knows yeah

462
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,820
i mean i think i think for

463
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:20,340
a kid i understand that people teach

464
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:22,950
their kids all different things so there's

465
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:25,050
plenty of people that i probably know

466
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:26,400
who teach their kids i've got to

467
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,830
be carefully taught there's no afterlife and

468
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:30,720
there's no nothing happens and you do

469
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:30,840
go

470
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,700
on the ground and but i also

471
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,830
think it's like a really big concept

472
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:36,810
for a little kid to accept and

473
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:38,520
that seems kind of it's like if

474
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:40,470
even if you grow to believe that

475
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:42,030
i just think it's a lot to

476
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:43,500
say to a little kid that like

477
00:16:44,391 --> 00:16:45,840
if if they know someone who died

478
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,890
that like they're just gone

479
00:16:48,210 --> 00:16:50,280
right i think yeah so no it's

480
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:52,080
it's an i mean i guess i

481
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:54,930
would like to read an article or

482
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:58,260
something written by atheist parents who who

483
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:00,720
raised their kids to to believe there's

484
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,070
nothing when they die and how that

485
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:03,630
has worked out for them or whatever

486
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:05,550
you know religion in general is kind

487
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:07,710
of comforting to everyone of all ages

488
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:08,280
true from

489
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:10,230
six to sixty nine i mean yes

490
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:12,180
but i'm of the opinion that

491
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:16,770
in the afterlife you'll be ahead of

492
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:18,660
okay i mean i know you make

493
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:21,090
that sie da da da the hell

494
00:17:21,090 --> 00:17:23,820
to bay by budget agenda digital squirrel

495
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:25,320
nut zippers zoom is

496
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:29,550
that's a great song by the way

497
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:32,070
yeah new after long why didn't they

498
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:34,440
ever make any other song they made

499
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,150
an i had one other man they

500
00:17:36,156 --> 00:17:37,860
didn't have a song called put a

501
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:39,270
lid on it i have that album

502
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:41,160
that they made okay they made more

503
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,570
than one album but i have their

504
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:44,250
first album yeah i've got the one

505
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:46,170
yeah this is good song

506
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:48,864
yeah good stuff picking on live we

507
00:17:48,881 --> 00:17:50,190
into something about that

508
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,590
now he just wanted to sing that

509
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:53,820
i want to sing this but i

510
00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:55,560
you know i was raised catholic and

511
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:58,140
and believed in heaven and but it

512
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:00,690
was always very it wasn't comforting to

513
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:02,430
me heaven was always very weird to

514
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:03,990
me i couldn't i guess because the

515
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:06,180
concept of hell is the problem yes

516
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:07,830
that i could picture very easily like

517
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:09,210
if you learn if you are just

518
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:10,920
like hey look there's ah

519
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:13,980
you know we call it heaven but

520
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:15,930
everyone when they die i want that's

521
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:17,220
what i think i don't think you

522
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:19,281
know well i may being raised it

523
00:18:19,281 --> 00:18:22,980
was like well ah only our special

524
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:24,810
people go to heaven yeah and everyone

525
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:26,700
else burns for all eternal that have

526
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:29,040
not committed adultery i mean it's hard

527
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,480
yeah it's a hard concept because when

528
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,560
you talk like i don't

529
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:32,970
think about i don't think someone who

530
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:34,530
had an affair is going to hell

531
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:36,150
but i'm saying i do think someone

532
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:37,950
who's like a pedophile probably shouldn't be

533
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:38,550
up in heaven

534
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:41,460
but what if they were in it's

535
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:43,350
weird like oh what are you doing

536
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:45,055
here he's i guess what i know

537
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:46,710
i my point is what if it's

538
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,870
what if it's not a reward like

539
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,850
like have that that's just where the

540
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:53,280
soul religions is heaven is a reward

541
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,050
hell is a damnation what if it

542
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:57,930
was just like everyone's consciousness gets sort

543
00:18:57,930 --> 00:18:59,880
of like uploaded into an a thief

544
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:03,330
serial you know being and and just

545
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:05,940
like it's it's it's a place that

546
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:07,920
everyone just everyone who has ever been

547
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,420
and will ever be just all share

548
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:11,040
well i actually think the movie even

549
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:14,430
hitler the movie zoeller did you watch

550
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:16,560
solo ah yes yeah i feel like

551
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,270
that is a great starting point for

552
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:19,170
that conversation

553
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,560
just flip on souls yeah

554
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,650
yeah it works that's all that was

555
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:28,320
my sexual education from my parents soul

556
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:30,510

575
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:08,250

576
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:10,410
say that he's going to go take

577
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:12,510

a frog believe i'm dissecting a frog

582
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:20,790

when when the pastor said that was

586
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,850
he being like kind of funny or

587
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:31,950
was he being serious i think he

588
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:34,770
was trying to nature scare that gets

589
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:37,050
parents to talk to their kids about

590
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:38,640
sex at a younger age or something

591
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,560
like that because by the time they

592
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,210
were thirteen or whatever they were already

593
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:43,740
corrupted and you needed to talk to

594
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:44,910
them about sex

595
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:46,770

albums and how the mascot eddie was

601
00:20:59,850 --> 00:21:02,010
a corpse and how that will lead

602
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:05,760
to heavy metal fans wanting to have

603
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,130

how many jews apples are no once

672
00:23:41,428 --> 00:23:42,810

put it in the know why people

680
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:58,199
do the math you can convert and

681
00:23:58,199 --> 00:24:00,060
figure out how much i owe oh

682
00:24:00,343 --> 00:24:01,350
i'm all right to put i'm all

683
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:03,210

00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:07,800
apples with that be how much is

686
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,630
an apple way as my first question

687
00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:13,440
yes in pounds not in kilos empirical

688
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:18,180
i put in blurbs okay and slobs

689
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:21,960
boy point three three lb boy point

690
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,780
three and it's a boy playing three

691
00:24:24,810 --> 00:24:27,537
three lb boy three three pounds sos

692
00:24:27,537 --> 00:24:30,150
so three apples per point so yeah

693
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:32,160
so what's your weight one ninety divided

694
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:34,590
by three so your proxy

695
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:36,510
lately you're under six hundred apple you're

696
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:41,310
sixty you're sixty three apples heavy i

697
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:43,140
don't think that didn't you say point

698
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:44,790
three three pounds

699
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:48,420
yeah but divided by three years should

700
00:24:48,432 --> 00:24:51,660
time at pinetree no it's three apples

701
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:53,730
per pound i think so he's gone

702
00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:54,510
this is what you want to do

703
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:56,670
but not by pounds your five hundred

704
00:24:56,670 --> 00:24:57,600
and seventy you want to do it

705
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,580
by kilos your five hundred seventy apples

706
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,470

certain people in my family i don't

00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,810
want to put them on blast even

800
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:16,320
though the elders

801
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:17,400
never listen

802
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:21,450
we'll figure it out really just base

803
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:24,630
everyone's worth on their weight yeah it's

804
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:26,490

recently going to the gym a lot

807
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:34,680
and it was like finally everything was

808
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:37,350
cool for this person in my family

809
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:38,640

00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:42,360
i'm so impressed and ah you know

812
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,590
and then and then when they watch

813
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:45,330
tv they're always like well that person

814
00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:48,300

00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:55,020
like like they're always judging everyone they

818
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:57,780
see by god how up and down

819
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:58,830
their wages fluctuate

820
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:00,180
rating and it's an i and i

821
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:04,170
started to realize that when i when

822
00:29:04,170 --> 00:29:05,850
i became like kind of attuned to

823
00:29:05,850 --> 00:29:07,500
it and so it's something that i'm

824
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:09,540
just trying to drop from my life

825
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,790
of oh yeah absolutely you know i

826
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:13,320
mean just not even just in like

827
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:15,540
turning inwards i mean like looking outwards

828
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:17,430
of anyway yeah gives a shit what

829
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:18,990
you know i've had fluctuate

830
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:21,690
thing wait for years and for me

831
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,040
i finally got to a point where

832
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:23,670
i was like

833
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:26,640
you know it's it's very hard when

834
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,720
you when you go through when your

835
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,340
body goes through changes it's very hard

836
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:31,620
sometimes to adjust to that and yeah

837
00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:32,910
puberty i buy now i've heard a

838
00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:34,560
monster and i'm like okay that is

839
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:35,970
for you thank you

840
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,360
i think it was weird that it

841
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,800
took so long no offense but it

842
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:43,650
was like um you know like to

843
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,900
the idea of of loving yourself where

844
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:50,040
you are is really more challenging why

845
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:52,980
did you want what did he think

846
00:29:53,010 --> 00:29:55,050
because we do the best bits lodi

847
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:57,150
and i'm gonna you're just

848
00:29:57,270 --> 00:29:59,520
you're just taking things in now just

849
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:00,120
really nilly

850
00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:02,580
free willy nilly

851
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:05,850
right well yeah wouldn't make sense okay

852
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,860
um but yeah loving yourself where you

853
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:09,420
are yeah because i was it was

854
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:10,350
easier for me to do it with

855
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:12,060
other people than it was for me

856
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,830
to do it with my yeah right

857
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:15,150
you know and to say like yeah

858
00:30:15,150 --> 00:30:17,040
like if you're if you're happy where

859
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,420
you are that's good the the most

860
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:19,830
important thing is being happy where you

861
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:21,957
are and for me i realised why

862
00:30:21,957 --> 00:30:23,760
i was not happy in certain

863
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:26,460
places um moda and also ah

864
00:30:28,034 --> 00:30:30,340
also wanting to be healthy too because

865
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:31,840
i was not i was not take

866
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,070
i wasn't take care of myself i

867
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:34,540
just wasn't taking care of myself yeah

868
00:30:34,660 --> 00:30:37,120
well you i not that you looked

869
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:40,210
poorly before exact ah well that you're

870
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:42,730
hearing with that but that compliment because

871
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:45,250
yeah i i it's ah it's tough

872
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:48,160
i meant it as i meant

873
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,450
second is just that you like you

874
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:50,440
don't mean like i it's like i'm

875
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:51,670
not saying you're better or worse or

876
00:30:51,670 --> 00:30:53,380
anything like that and i have a

877
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:55,090
friend who's recently been on like a

878
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,820
weight loss journey but not even it's

879
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:59,680
not it's again not really focused on

880
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,540
losing weight so much as feeling healthy

881
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:03,430
and just like changing habits and stuff

882
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:04,897
yeah yeah and so it's one of

883
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:06,280
the i also i don't i don't

884
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,570
like it the lorne when it's the

885
00:31:07,570 --> 00:31:08,320
other way like on the

886
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:10,539
bachelor's reality recap when it's the bachelor

887
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:12,550
read and she's or the bachelor in

888
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:14,020
there and they're saying like well i

889
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:16,804
want with bachelor rinos who has over

890
00:31:16,804 --> 00:31:19,390
the ken marino who i want someone

891
00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:22,240
who has a healthy lifestyle but when

892
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,290
they're really just saying they want a

893
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:26,590
muscle mass because weight doesn't determine health

894
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:28,210
but i'm saying that's why i'm saying

895
00:31:28,210 --> 00:31:28,480
i'm like

896
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:30,160
what if what if would they ever

897
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:32,530
go for someone who's like kind of

898
00:31:32,530 --> 00:31:34,270
a beefy guy who actually is healthy

899
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:36,314
and who's kolesar right down and more

900
00:31:36,314 --> 00:31:38,110
when you know they're saying you know

901
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:39,880
yeah same yeah so that's what i

902
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:43,000
mean my friend because she she wasn't

903
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,980
like trying to lose weight to look

904
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:46,300
a certain way or have a certain

905
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:48,310
number trying to redistribute it yeah but

906
00:31:48,370 --> 00:31:48,550
well

907
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,290
because it's more that she was like

908
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,730
i haven't been eating while i haven't

909
00:31:51,730 --> 00:31:53,080
but you know you can be eating

910
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,280
while doing those things in your body

911
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:56,290
can look all different ways yeah but

912
00:31:56,290 --> 00:31:58,750
also her she has lost weight as

913
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,100
a result and so is one of

914
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:01,240
those things where i'm like i know

915
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:02,680
that that's not her intention but i

916
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,900
also want to compliment that because she

917
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:06,670
looks great and shows great before i'd

918
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:08,500
ever thought anything negative about her but

919
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:10,330
she looks great and maybe we should

920
00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:13,510
stop saying people look great in general

921
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:14,980
well i know because i like the

922
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:16,480
jersey comes this whole week like weird

923
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,550

impressed by that commitment and then as

957
00:33:15,610 --> 00:33:16,540

958
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:18,220

so finish this no groups just that

965
00:33:35,050 --> 00:33:36,970
i think that it's not negative to

966

say someone looks good i don't think

967
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:41,050
someone who is working on themselves actively

968
00:33:41,050 --> 00:33:42,460
is gonna be offended that you said

969
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:44,860
you look good no here's here's the

970
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:46,750

1011
00:35:04,030 --> 00:35:06,130
say like hey you look great because

to feel like one for them i

1073
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:24,913
feel like i ah you know i've

1074
00:37:24,913 --> 00:37:26,740
i've been taking some online classes we

1075
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,840
have a doula who's teaching us things

1076
00:37:28,870 --> 00:37:29,560
classes and what

1077
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:34,180
labor and delivery and processing we're still

1078
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:37,420
talking about that yes sorry and um

1079
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:39,280
and so i'm really focused on that

1080
00:37:39,370 --> 00:37:40,780
but but it's also something that it

1081
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:41,950
kind of has come up as in

1082
00:37:41,950 --> 00:37:43,210
my mind as i've been thinking about

1083
00:37:43,210 --> 00:37:44,620
this is like and i think it's

1084
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:46,480
very common but i'm focused very focused

1085
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,700
on the delivery part because that's like

1086
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,589
that's a really important part and it's

1087
00:37:50,589 --> 00:37:50,800
sky

1088
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,750
carry a little bit and you know

1089
00:37:52,750 --> 00:37:55,750
she's big and then you know the

1090
00:37:55,750 --> 00:37:56,590
rest of it is like i have

1091
00:37:56,590 --> 00:37:57,610
to raise the child

1092
00:37:58,930 --> 00:38:01,570
yeah i mean you're yourself focused on

1093
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:05,230
the legitimate three hours yeah you know

1094
00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:07,240
that you're forgetting about the next eighteen

1095
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:09,010
years like the wang versus marriage and

1096
00:38:09,010 --> 00:38:10,690
i think that that's okay for right

1097
00:38:10,690 --> 00:38:12,160
now i'll definitely figure it all out

1098
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,810
i have time you know here here's

1099
00:38:13,810 --> 00:38:15,790
my here's my new theory on parenting

1100
00:38:16,990 --> 00:38:20,200
you split your money with the kid

1101
00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:22,090
like right down the middle right so

1102
00:38:22,090 --> 00:38:23,860
right and you give you give you

1103
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:26,020
hear about lawrence half your money to

1104
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:28,780
the kid and then you say anytime

have to do for it that was

1237
00:42:59,875 --> 00:43:02,605
probably a lot of elementary school and

1238
00:43:02,605 --> 00:43:04,135
like i think it might have gone

1239
00:43:04,135 --> 00:43:05,215
up a little bit in middle school

1240
00:43:05,215 --> 00:43:07,735
but not really um and then what

1241
00:43:07,735 --> 00:43:08,545
did i do i did a lot

1242
00:43:08,545 --> 00:43:11,005
of the the whole concept of allowance

1243
00:43:11,485 --> 00:43:12,535
what is it

1244
00:43:12,535 --> 00:43:14,305
it's basically just to give your kid

1245
00:43:14,305 --> 00:43:17,125
like ah a treat that they want

1246
00:43:17,245 --> 00:43:18,475
every once in a while or like

1247
00:43:18,475 --> 00:43:20,545
to teach them how to spend money

1248
00:43:20,545 --> 00:43:21,715
is that yeah how to say i

1249
00:43:21,715 --> 00:43:22,705
mean i would get it in any

1250
00:43:22,705 --> 00:43:24,085
we'd always go to candy or whatever

1251
00:43:24,385 --> 00:43:26,215
yeah i i don't know what i

1252
00:43:26,215 --> 00:43:27,145
would spend i guess i was buy

1253
00:43:27,145 --> 00:43:28,345
a beanie baby because they were six

1254
00:43:28,345 --> 00:43:31,078
dollars that was kind of exciting all

1255
00:43:31,078 --> 00:43:32,695
of dover for candy exactly

1256
00:43:32,695 --> 00:43:35,425
they were taxed um but six weeks

1257
00:43:35,425 --> 00:43:37,705
you could buy another beanie baby why

1258
00:43:37,705 --> 00:43:39,835
every six weeks oh with the dollar

1259
00:43:39,895 --> 00:43:42,115
because they were six dollars yeah um

1260
00:43:42,235 --> 00:43:44,005
i i don't think it was based

1261
00:43:44,005 --> 00:43:45,535
on like specific chores like there was

1262
00:43:45,625 --> 00:43:47,005
like a chore chart but i did

1263
00:43:47,005 --> 00:43:47,755
a lot of things i did the

1264
00:43:47,755 --> 00:43:50,395
laundry in my house growing up and

1265
00:43:50,755 --> 00:43:52,825
yeah i liked it but

1266
00:43:52,855 --> 00:43:54,445
you can't even iron a shirt why

1267
00:43:54,445 --> 00:43:57,025
didn't have to iron anything okay um

1268
00:43:57,055 --> 00:43:58,675
but i would fold everyone's clothes and

1269
00:43:58,675 --> 00:44:00,325
put them in their room and then

1270
00:44:00,325 --> 00:44:01,765
like you know that was what i

1271
00:44:01,765 --> 00:44:03,625
do a lot um other than that

1272
00:44:03,625 --> 00:44:04,495
i don't know what else i think

1273
00:44:04,495 --> 00:44:06,295
that's more than i did already yeah

1274
00:44:06,295 --> 00:44:07,765
i did do a lot of gardening

1275
00:44:09,025 --> 00:44:11,965
oh that seems hard like pulling weeds

1276
00:44:11,965 --> 00:44:13,255
yeah so i feel like i had

1277
00:44:13,255 --> 00:44:15,325
to do that i did um so

1278
00:44:15,355 --> 00:44:18,325
less sweeping sweep down hate sweeping to

1279
00:44:18,325 --> 00:44:20,425

summertime trash cans absolutely um what else

1282
00:44:27,715 --> 00:44:29,065
trying to think like we were supposed

1283
00:44:29,125 --> 00:44:30,865
ah i was not good at like

1284
00:44:30,865 --> 00:44:32,875
cleaning bathrooms like things like that that

1285
00:44:32,875 --> 00:44:35,875
required like scrubbing like real elbow grease

1286
00:44:35,875 --> 00:44:37,735
i was terrible yeah i sometimes had

1287
00:44:37,735 --> 00:44:39,475
to do the mirror in the bathroom

1288
00:44:39,535 --> 00:44:40,885
please don't wait

1289
00:44:42,085 --> 00:44:43,645
doors locked it's just using you and

1290
00:44:43,645 --> 00:44:43,855
me

1291
00:44:44,935 --> 00:44:45,715
but yeah sometimes

1292
00:44:47,575 --> 00:44:51,145
so yeah sometimes i'd have to create

1293
00:44:51,145 --> 00:44:53,935
some windows or mirrors i don't like

1294
00:44:53,935 --> 00:44:56,785
that either really any kind of fizzle

1295
00:44:56,785 --> 00:44:58,555
i mean i keep my room clean

1296
00:44:59,035 --> 00:45:01,525
and then i i liked cleaning like

1297
00:45:01,525 --> 00:45:04,075
stuff so like i liked organizing so

1298
00:45:04,135 --> 00:45:05,275
you know as i said i would

1299
00:45:05,335 --> 00:45:06,415
go to my brother's room and clean

1300
00:45:06,415 --> 00:45:06,985
his room

1301
00:45:07,405 --> 00:45:09,745
i always liked organizing i liked cleaning

1302
00:45:09,745 --> 00:45:11,575
windows because windows felt like

1303
00:45:12,805 --> 00:45:14,874
it was satisfying like cleaning windows was

1304
00:45:14,874 --> 00:45:17,005
satisfying like there's a tangible result of

1305
00:45:17,005 --> 00:45:19,135
the ah yes yeah yeah yeah whereas

1306
00:45:19,135 --> 00:45:21,835
clean glasses sweeping disgusting but yeah cleaning

1307
00:45:21,835 --> 00:45:25,525
windows is like making making a dirty

1308
00:45:25,525 --> 00:45:27,625
window clean and looking through it is

1309
00:45:27,625 --> 00:45:30,895

i think about that so i think

1326
00:46:06,175 --> 00:46:06,955
about it a lot

1327
00:46:07,405 --> 00:46:09,715
there's zero or there's a health store

1328
00:46:09,715 --> 00:46:12,685
that i go no um that's downtown

1329
00:46:12,745 --> 00:46:14,125

1330
00:46:14,125 --> 00:46:15,685
great hat store they make like hats

1331
00:46:15,685 --> 00:46:17,456
for movies and stuff like that you

1332
00:46:17,456 --> 00:46:19,855
shall work there i have so i've

1333
00:46:19,885 --> 00:46:20,995
honestly thought about it because i would

1334
00:46:20,995 --> 00:46:22,405
love to be able to make a

1335
00:46:22,405 --> 00:46:24,595
hat that would be so cool it

1336
00:46:24,595 --> 00:46:25,525
would be cool i don't think they'd

1337
00:46:25,585 --> 00:46:27,235
need any money you could be in

1338
00:46:27,235 --> 00:46:27,415
a pr

1339
00:46:27,415 --> 00:46:29,065
princess i thought about being an apprentice

1340
00:46:29,065 --> 00:46:30,415
yeah yeah i feel like you could

1341
00:46:30,535 --> 00:46:32,515
i feel like you get that i

1342
00:46:32,515 --> 00:46:34,705
think i think about andy kaufman just

1343
00:46:34,705 --> 00:46:36,565
bussing tables maybe only at the height

1344
00:46:36,565 --> 00:46:38,275
of his fame when i think about

1345
00:46:38,275 --> 00:46:39,685
that i didn't know about that makes

1346
00:46:39,685 --> 00:46:41,725
you mad i i think i think

1347
00:46:41,725 --> 00:46:43,315
it would be interesting to do just

1348
00:46:43,315 --> 00:46:44,965
like i think that's what sometimes although

1349
00:46:44,965 --> 00:46:46,045
i guess i guess if i were

1350
00:46:46,045 --> 00:46:46,944
going to do it instead of it

1351
00:46:46,944 --> 00:46:47,575
being a job for

1352
00:46:47,605 --> 00:46:48,625
money it would be better just to

1353
00:46:48,625 --> 00:46:51,500
volunteer at a place yeah like making

1354
00:46:51,835 --> 00:46:53,245
like a thing of service that you

1355
00:46:53,245 --> 00:46:54,535
know learned that is the one thing

1356
00:46:54,535 --> 00:46:56,815
i thought about instead of going to

1357
00:46:56,815 --> 00:46:59,605
church on sunday like making one of

1358
00:46:59,605 --> 00:47:01,285
the weekend days like a day of

1359
00:47:01,285 --> 00:47:03,115
service i think that's great i mean

1360
00:47:03,145 --> 00:47:05,725
every time i have volunteered in my

1361
00:47:05,725 --> 00:47:07,667
adult life i feel like it's so

1362
00:47:07,735 --> 00:47:08,455
happy i did it

1363
00:47:09,865 --> 00:47:11,515
um there's like a lot there i

1364
00:47:11,515 --> 00:47:13,195
did what i get the beginning the

1365
00:47:13,195 --> 00:47:14,815
pandemic i volunteered at um

1366
00:47:15,925 --> 00:47:17,139
er no it was before the pandemic

1367
00:47:17,178 --> 00:47:18,565
didn't have a mask on yeah i

1368
00:47:18,565 --> 00:47:20,695
guess it was before just didn't feel

1369
00:47:20,695 --> 00:47:23,155
that hobby when the mask um i

1370
00:47:23,185 --> 00:47:25,825
yeah won't stop you but i volunteered

1371
00:47:25,825 --> 00:47:27,325
at the la foodbank and it was

1372
00:47:27,325 --> 00:47:29,425
such a nice day and when we

1373
00:47:29,425 --> 00:47:32,560
used to do that with usb collapse

1374
00:47:32,575 --> 00:47:35,635
noon i remember that usb yeah ah

1375
00:47:35,665 --> 00:47:36,055
yeah

1376
00:47:36,085 --> 00:47:38,455
i'm sort of wing of ah she

1377
00:47:38,455 --> 00:47:40,375
started the you know getting onto her

1378
00:47:40,495 --> 00:47:42,235
thing yeah yeah the volunteer thing and

1379
00:47:42,235 --> 00:47:43,195
we did it at the food bank

1380
00:47:43,195 --> 00:47:44,485
for quite a few years where you'd

1381
00:47:44,515 --> 00:47:46,075
go down and you'd like box up

1382
00:47:46,075 --> 00:47:48,745
meals and stuff like that um which

1383
00:47:48,835 --> 00:47:50,965
in some ways kind of feels like

1384
00:47:51,655 --> 00:47:53,755
it's more of a promotional thing because

1385
00:47:53,755 --> 00:47:55,675
they don't really need your help doing

1386
00:47:55,675 --> 00:47:56,215
that as much

1387
00:47:56,215 --> 00:47:58,195
as like i think they wanted everyone

1388
00:47:58,195 --> 00:48:00,775
to be out there like saying hey

1389
00:48:00,775 --> 00:48:02,965
the foodbank is around yeah oh well

1390
00:48:02,965 --> 00:48:05,095
well you know works like posta meals

1391
00:48:05,095 --> 00:48:06,565
and then serving oh that's cool

1392
00:48:07,255 --> 00:48:09,865
oh that's cool um but then um

1393
00:48:09,955 --> 00:48:11,545
i also one other organization were like

1394
00:48:11,545 --> 00:48:12,685
that cool up i think was the

1395
00:48:12,685 --> 00:48:13,962
one who organized this was probably through

1396
00:48:14,005 --> 00:48:16,735
cb the baby to baby place that's

1397
00:48:16,735 --> 00:48:19,165
um where they give women who swapped

1398
00:48:19,165 --> 00:48:21,235
babies don't it's like they give clothes

1399
00:48:21,235 --> 00:48:23,185
and diapers to babies give them to

1400
00:48:23,185 --> 00:48:24,625
each other need them

1401
00:48:26,485 --> 00:48:27,835
and so it's it but it's like

1402
00:48:27,835 --> 00:48:30,265
sometimes volunteering like i think sometimes volunteering

1403
00:48:30,295 --> 00:48:33,175
can seem intimidating because a so i

1404
00:48:33,175 --> 00:48:34,075
don't know like i can get i

1405
00:48:34,075 --> 00:48:36,355
can get weirdly shy in certain situations

1406
00:48:36,355 --> 00:48:37,885
i don't know but like um but

1407
00:48:38,005 --> 00:48:39,595
then the things that i've done i

1408
00:48:39,595 --> 00:48:40,855
found that like oh there's always a

1409
00:48:40,855 --> 00:48:43,465
task you can do that isn't it

1410
00:48:43,465 --> 00:48:45,835
sits within your comfort zone like you

1411
00:48:45,835 --> 00:48:45,895
do

1412
00:48:45,895 --> 00:48:47,605
don't have to do something that is

1413
00:48:47,995 --> 00:48:49,315
if you're if it just is mainly

1414
00:48:49,375 --> 00:48:50,425
to people out there who are like

1415
00:48:50,425 --> 00:48:51,685
afraid to volunteer because i do feel

1416
00:48:51,685 --> 00:48:52,885
like there's like an element of like

1417
00:48:52,885 --> 00:48:54,625
social anxiety that comes with the idea

1418
00:48:54,655 --> 00:48:56,185
oh i'm hearing yes but like well

1419
00:48:56,185 --> 00:48:58,435
also the the social anxiety of being

1420
00:48:58,435 --> 00:48:59,935
in any situation where you don't know

1421
00:48:59,935 --> 00:49:01,615
how to do it yes yeah is

1422
00:49:01,645 --> 00:49:03,325
is very big like where you don't

1423
00:49:03,325 --> 00:49:05,065
just don't know what's going to happen

1424
00:49:05,065 --> 00:49:06,055
like if you can't pick

1425
00:49:06,085 --> 00:49:09,205
her yourself doing something like like if

1426
00:49:09,205 --> 00:49:10,435
i show up to this place what

1427
00:49:10,435 --> 00:49:11,305
are they going to have me do

1428
00:49:11,305 --> 00:49:13,015
and there's so many it just gets

1429
00:49:13,015 --> 00:49:14,785
to be very paralyzing yeah but like

1430
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:16,645
for example with the baby to baby

1431
00:49:16,705 --> 00:49:18,865
charity like there were people you could

1432
00:49:18,865 --> 00:49:19,945
see you could stand there and fold

1433
00:49:19,945 --> 00:49:22,015
clothes and sort them or you could

1434
00:49:22,015 --> 00:49:24,205
like put boxes together you could label

1435
00:49:24,265 --> 00:49:26,185
addresses or you or there's something that's

1436
00:49:26,215 --> 00:49:27,895
more hands on with other people like

1437
00:49:28,315 --> 00:49:30,325
so you could do something by yourself

1438
00:49:30,325 --> 00:49:31,555
kind of or get involved with other

1439
00:49:31,555 --> 00:49:33,385
people and i think that's like a

1440
00:49:33,385 --> 00:49:34,315
good thing to keep in mind with

1441
00:49:34,315 --> 00:49:36,835
that kind of thing yeah i think

1442
00:49:36,835 --> 00:49:38,125
that's a good thing to do with

1443
00:49:38,185 --> 00:49:39,863
your kids too is just a nice

1444
00:49:39,863 --> 00:49:42,145
idea still it's still a thing

1445
00:49:43,285 --> 00:49:45,985
um but i also think we should

1446
00:49:45,985 --> 00:49:47,905
get part-time jobs i did i tell

1447
00:49:47,905 --> 00:49:49,255
you about the guy at the record

1448
00:49:49,255 --> 00:49:51,853
store who owned a hire me and

1449
00:49:52,045 --> 00:49:54,565
recently okay so no no not recently

1450
00:49:54,595 --> 00:49:57,475
but someone i should work yeah

1451
00:49:58,615 --> 00:49:59,635
when i was in college i would

1452
00:49:59,635 --> 00:50:01,045
go into this record store a lot

1453
00:50:01,045 --> 00:50:03,685
and ask for very specific things you

1454
00:50:03,685 --> 00:50:05,485
know and be like cool cloudy yeah

1455
00:50:05,485 --> 00:50:07,285
this is smart people say hey what's

1456
00:50:07,285 --> 00:50:08,425
a cool record that would be like

1457
00:50:08,454 --> 00:50:10,435
cool with all the chicks at cafe

1458
00:50:10,465 --> 00:50:14,605
cora ah i still don't know that

1459
00:50:14,881 --> 00:50:16,255
the guys the guy behind the counter

1460
00:50:16,255 --> 00:50:17,905
was in ah ah a band that

1461
00:50:17,905 --> 00:50:18,775
was very

1462
00:50:18,775 --> 00:50:20,755
very influenced by the wonder stuff they

1463
00:50:20,755 --> 00:50:21,955
were like a wonder stuff rip off

1464
00:50:21,955 --> 00:50:23,845
band in any case so i would

1465
00:50:23,845 --> 00:50:24,805

that's right we do this every single

1575
00:54:06,890 --> 00:54:09,470
time and everyone loves it three years

1576
00:54:09,470 --> 00:54:10,880
where we play a little game amongst

1577
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:12,530
ourselves and you get to listen to

1578
00:54:12,530 --> 00:54:12,950
it but

1579
00:54:12,980 --> 00:54:13,940
you can play along with us we

1580
00:54:13,940 --> 00:54:16,100
just can't hear you this is sure

1581
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:18,290
this is a game called text guests

1582
00:54:18,830 --> 00:54:20,330
and it is similar to the famous

1583
00:54:20,330 --> 00:54:23,150
show gravid watcher but instead of reading

1584
00:54:23,150 --> 00:54:24,980
one side of a stage play we

1585
00:54:24,980 --> 00:54:26,900
will take turns choosing a text thread

1586
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:28,970
from our phones that we're comfortable making

1587
00:54:28,970 --> 00:54:31,430
public and really me we're not very

1588
00:54:31,460 --> 00:54:33,110
comfortable with god all

1589
00:54:33,110 --> 00:54:34,340
of them have the names of famous

1590
00:54:34,370 --> 00:54:36,830
people have them and we read one

1591
00:54:36,830 --> 00:54:38,120
side of the conversation the other two

1592
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:40,550
players take turns responding to the texts

1593
00:54:40,580 --> 00:54:42,290
or we could turn into a three

1594
00:54:42,290 --> 00:54:45,200
person group chat but have to keep

1595
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:48,440
the conversation as coherent as possible since

1596
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:49,850
this is a checks conversation we can

1597
00:54:49,850 --> 00:54:52,790
also vocalize emojis memes or reactions as

1598
00:54:52,790 --> 00:54:53,270
needed

1599
00:54:53,270 --> 00:54:55,370
ed should we just turn into like

1600
00:54:55,370 --> 00:54:57,650
a conversation rather than a text conversation

1601
00:54:58,010 --> 00:54:59,150
you know what i mean like you're

1602
00:54:59,150 --> 00:55:01,670
just reading yay the conversation that started

1603
00:55:01,692 --> 00:55:03,230
