just she liked it you do comedy

289
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:19,634
yeah but she's

290
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:21,755
using a totally different like you're saying

291
00:10:21,875 --> 00:10:24,545
she's a pain yes i know just

292
00:10:24,545 --> 00:10:25,836
real pain in the ass but she

293
00:10:25,836 --> 00:10:27,575
isn't like that art community it's totally

294
00:10:27,575 --> 00:10:28,985
different like i only know a certain

295
00:10:28,985 --> 00:10:30,710
things about her community and you know

296
00:10:30,769 --> 00:10:32,315
just kind of there's not we are

297
00:10:32,345 --> 00:10:34,385
crossover do you think do you think

298
00:10:34,415 --> 00:10:36,725
if suddenly a new person came into

299
00:10:36,725 --> 00:10:38,435
your life where you're like i think

300
00:10:38,435 --> 00:10:40,085
this person is my best friend no

301
00:10:40,325 --> 00:10:40,535
definite

302
00:10:40,625 --> 00:10:41,735
have people that i think are my

303
00:10:41,735 --> 00:10:43,745
other best friends right so what did

304
00:10:43,745 --> 00:10:45,095
you think you could not say that

305
00:10:45,095 --> 00:10:46,415
to her because it's like look we've

306
00:10:46,415 --> 00:10:47,855
been having this going since we were

307
00:10:47,855 --> 00:10:50,285
five we cannot stop this train here's

308
00:10:50,285 --> 00:10:51,965
what it is she will always hold

309
00:10:51,965 --> 00:10:53,525
the place of my best friend like

310
00:10:53,525 --> 00:10:55,115
i introduced her as my best friend

311
00:10:55,835 --> 00:10:57,485
but i don't introduce like wild horses

312
00:10:57,485 --> 00:10:58,955
as my best friend if i'm introducing

313
00:10:58,955 --> 00:11:00,605
like here's my best friend mary

314
00:11:00,725 --> 00:11:02,015
my best friend three p i just

315
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:03,305

316
00:11:03,305 --> 00:11:06,005

to like if ah sure to meet

319
00:11:09,155 --> 00:11:10,415
you i would probably say she's my

320
00:11:10,415 --> 00:11:11,615
best friend well you don't need to

321
00:11:11,615 --> 00:11:14,195
because now you know best friend is

322
00:11:14,195 --> 00:11:16,325
a weird term many ways and like

323
00:11:16,325 --> 00:11:17,405
well we qualified

324
00:11:18,575 --> 00:11:20,195
yeah here's why i say it about

325
00:11:20,195 --> 00:11:22,415
her i like it because it contextualizes

326
00:11:22,415 --> 00:11:24,155
her well also admit i'm bringing her

327
00:11:24,155 --> 00:11:25,595
into a comedy party or something that

328
00:11:25,595 --> 00:11:26,645
i'm like this my best friend like

329
00:11:26,825 --> 00:11:28,625
well she's not part of your your

330
00:11:28,625 --> 00:11:30,785
regular crew right as well so it's

331
00:11:30,785 --> 00:11:32,315
good to yeah like yeah let everyone

332
00:11:32,315 --> 00:11:34,265
know if he jumped him severing relations

333
00:11:34,265 --> 00:11:36,416
yes she's actually somebody else to fire

334
00:11:36,935 --> 00:11:38,585
here's why she is worthy of being

335
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:41,405
yes yes i feel like it's it's

336
00:11:41,735 --> 00:11:42,935
it is such a it's a it's

337
00:11:42,935 --> 00:11:43,745
a thing you say when you're a

338
00:11:43,745 --> 00:11:44,765
little kid yeah but

339
00:11:45,845 --> 00:11:47,615
as you get older you realize that

340
00:11:47,615 --> 00:11:49,565
really is a true thing that it's

341
00:11:49,565 --> 00:11:50,945
a way that you feel about certain

342
00:11:50,945 --> 00:11:52,295
people in your life that you're like

343
00:11:52,535 --> 00:11:54,335
this these people are my best friends

344
00:11:54,335 --> 00:11:56,255
and there's no other way i can't

345
00:11:56,255 --> 00:11:57,545
stop i can not think of it

346
00:11:57,545 --> 00:11:59,045
that way or did you how did

347
00:11:59,045 --> 00:12:02,075

we already saw each other on the

351
00:12:07,175 --> 00:12:09,155

520
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:14,375
out recently i we had a long

521
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:15,605
car trip where i was moving them

522
00:18:15,605 --> 00:18:17,255
out back here to california and at

523
00:18:17,255 --> 00:18:18,275
the very end

524
00:18:19,415 --> 00:18:20,698
like by the way here's something if

525
00:18:20,698 --> 00:18:22,925
i was gonna kill say aiya christmas

526
00:18:22,925 --> 00:18:24,665
i i took the opportunity to ask

527
00:18:24,665 --> 00:18:26,225
him like questions about the work because

528
00:18:26,225 --> 00:18:27,305
i'd never really heard any of it

529
00:18:27,755 --> 00:18:29,375
and he did tell me a story

530
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:33,095
about flying a helicopter and suddenly ah

531
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:35,255
there there was a combatant who picked

532
00:18:35,255 --> 00:18:36,665
up a machine gun and pointed it

533
00:18:36,665 --> 00:18:37,925
right at him as he was hovering

534
00:18:37,925 --> 00:18:39,575
there and jammed at

535
00:18:39,605 --> 00:18:41,105
as he was firing right at him

536
00:18:41,105 --> 00:18:43,295
and spitting in your life flashed before

537
00:18:43,295 --> 00:18:44,887
his eyes right you'll never have to

538
00:18:44,887 --> 00:18:47,045
go i gotta get back there i

539
00:18:47,045 --> 00:18:49,325
gotta get back the emmys needs me

540
00:18:50,735 --> 00:18:52,175
kind of leads me to a question

541
00:18:52,175 --> 00:18:54,575
why do you feel did you ever

542
00:18:54,575 --> 00:18:56,135
feel like a pressure to follow in

543
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:58,625
his footsteps at all or like even

544
00:18:58,625 --> 00:19:00,125
just from yourself like oh i should

545
00:19:00,125 --> 00:19:01,955
do something like that like because it's

546
00:19:01,955 --> 00:19:04,085
so serious and well i think there's

547
00:19:04,085 --> 00:19:06,515
a small bit of pressure of like

548
00:19:06,545 --> 00:19:09,035
when you grow up in a family

549
00:19:09,395 --> 00:19:10,535
you know that's in the arm for

550
00:19:10,535 --> 00:19:12,335
cases where it's it's not even like

551
00:19:12,335 --> 00:19:14,165
we i mean my grandfather also was

552
00:19:14,165 --> 00:19:16,355
in the armed forces so ah and

553
00:19:16,505 --> 00:19:18,515
in world war two so my grandpa

554
00:19:18,515 --> 00:19:21,215
to ah my dad really yeah really

555
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:23,045
wow amazing but i don't think it

556
00:19:23,045 --> 00:19:24,845
was ah you know being the third

557
00:19:24,845 --> 00:19:27,125
generation i don't it wasn't like i

558
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:28,505
had pressure to like you should be

559
00:19:28,505 --> 00:19:30,335
in the armed forces too because i

560
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:30,695
don't think my

561
00:19:30,725 --> 00:19:33,455
dad ever even necessarily wanted that for

562
00:19:33,455 --> 00:19:35,015
me i think it was more of

563
00:19:35,015 --> 00:19:37,655
like the culture of like our enforces

564
00:19:37,655 --> 00:19:39,905
like manly stuff yeah you know and

565
00:19:39,905 --> 00:19:41,165
my dad is a is a guy

566
00:19:41,165 --> 00:19:43,235
who likes art and and and stuff

567
00:19:43,235 --> 00:19:44,495
so it's not like he's like you

568
00:19:44,495 --> 00:19:45,335
know what do you do and look

569
00:19:45,335 --> 00:19:47,075
at paintings or whatever but it's just

570
00:19:47,075 --> 00:19:50,015
more more like you know hey can't

571
00:19:50,015 --> 00:19:50,855
you like sports

572
00:19:50,945 --> 00:19:52,145
or a little bit more like that

573
00:19:52,145 --> 00:19:53,705
yeah but but not not too bad

574
00:19:53,855 --> 00:19:57,995
yeah um yeah boy um my dad

575
00:19:58,595 --> 00:20:01,745
because he was so much older like

576
00:20:01,775 --> 00:20:03,545
military service was not a thing i

577
00:20:03,695 --> 00:20:06,005
ever thought about my older brother was

578
00:20:06,005 --> 00:20:07,775
in the navy um and he was

579
00:20:07,775 --> 00:20:09,725
lucky that he was in it before

580
00:20:10,145 --> 00:20:11,015
all of our current wow

581
00:20:11,015 --> 00:20:12,515
wars yeah what year you got it

582
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:13,775
now that's like like back when you

583
00:20:13,775 --> 00:20:15,785
could actually do it to get money

584
00:20:15,785 --> 00:20:17,345
for college right right and he was

585
00:20:17,345 --> 00:20:19,085
like later yeah there's very little danger

586
00:20:19,085 --> 00:20:21,845
of you being destroyed over so yeah

587
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:24,575
yeah was this pre like ninety word

588
00:20:24,575 --> 00:20:26,735
yes before the first gulf war okay

589
00:20:26,735 --> 00:20:30,185
before the balkans ah that or i

590
00:20:30,215 --> 00:20:31,175

okay so i get like mid eighties

592
00:20:33,675 --> 00:20:36,083

that you are not your father's son

762
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:25,516
that your mother had an affair because

763
00:26:25,516 --> 00:26:27,135
your i will say as your grow

764
00:26:27,165 --> 00:26:29,475

me the twenty three meas stuff the

766
00:26:31,095 --> 00:26:33,585
other day and that leads me to

767
00:26:33,585 --> 00:26:35,505
believe that that i am truly

768
00:26:36,225 --> 00:26:38,055
there yeah because i don't think you

769
00:26:38,055 --> 00:26:40,455
get that from your parents unless you

770
00:26:40,485 --> 00:26:41,416
you i don't know if you read

771
00:26:41,416 --> 00:26:42,255
that i'm gonna give it to you

772
00:26:42,255 --> 00:26:43,215
like they don't they're going to be

773
00:26:43,215 --> 00:26:44,775
like let's show him the the yeah

774
00:26:44,835 --> 00:26:45,765
well i don't know if you were

775
00:26:45,765 --> 00:26:47,205
there was some twitter thread about ah

776
00:26:47,235 --> 00:26:50,325
of a woman i believe who gave

777
00:26:50,535 --> 00:26:52,545
everyone in her family twenty three me

778
00:26:52,545 --> 00:26:55,215
stuff for christmas and suddenly the mom

779
00:26:55,215 --> 00:26:56,175
started like

780
00:26:56,355 --> 00:26:58,305
panic panicking and going oh we don't

781
00:26:58,305 --> 00:26:59,745
have to do this you know i

782
00:26:59,745 --> 00:27:01,185
think one of us go like why

783
00:27:01,185 --> 00:27:02,505
don't we'll we'll just do it and

784
00:27:02,505 --> 00:27:03,555
then you know it's a waste of

785
00:27:03,555 --> 00:27:05,865
money if everyone does it right oh

786
00:27:05,865 --> 00:27:07,425
my god and then suddenly like went

787
00:27:07,425 --> 00:27:10,005
upstairs and started having like loud conversations

788
00:27:10,005 --> 00:27:13,005
with her husband and then finally after

789
00:27:13,005 --> 00:27:14,535
a few hours came downstairs and let

790
00:27:14,535 --> 00:27:16,155
them know that they were adopted

791
00:27:16,815 --> 00:27:18,645
oh wow

792
00:27:19,155 --> 00:27:20,350
but they were like were they adult

793
00:27:20,355 --> 00:27:21,795
oh and they were adults yeah and

794
00:27:21,795 --> 00:27:22,815
they did not know that they were

795
00:27:22,815 --> 00:27:24,105
dying just that's not right i don't

796
00:27:24,105 --> 00:27:25,455
think i mean maybe not i don't

797
00:27:25,455 --> 00:27:26,385
know i guess i can't say that

798
00:27:26,385 --> 00:27:28,035
one hundred percent yeah it feels like

799
00:27:28,035 --> 00:27:29,115
something that you should have the right

800
00:27:29,115 --> 00:27:30,735
to know it never occurred to me

801
00:27:30,735 --> 00:27:32,505
that people would not tell their kids

802
00:27:32,505 --> 00:27:33,795
at some point that they were dead

803
00:27:33,795 --> 00:27:34,725
i think it was that that was

804
00:27:34,725 --> 00:27:36,705
just too but it was maybe now

805
00:27:36,705 --> 00:27:38,655
feel that i shouldn't say that blanket

806
00:27:38,835 --> 00:27:39,225
i guess

807
00:27:39,315 --> 00:27:41,175
you don't have to yeah well i

808
00:27:41,175 --> 00:27:42,976
suppose people like actually it's my right

809
00:27:43,005 --> 00:27:43,846
now too and then i had to

810
00:27:43,846 --> 00:27:45,135
like deal with i started thinking about

811
00:27:45,135 --> 00:27:46,965
the i started thinking about the major

812
00:27:47,325 --> 00:27:50,955
life changes or or things in life

813
00:27:50,955 --> 00:27:52,965
that could be incorrect that you just

814
00:27:52,965 --> 00:27:54,975
assume about i started writing about like

815
00:27:55,155 --> 00:27:57,615
oh i a technically i wonder if

816
00:27:57,615 --> 00:27:58,785
i could have a kid

817
00:27:59,475 --> 00:28:01,365
out there and i started like going

818
00:28:01,365 --> 00:28:04,125
through every relationship that i had and

819
00:28:04,125 --> 00:28:05,175
you got to two and then you're

820
00:28:05,175 --> 00:28:05,655
like dumb

821
00:28:07,425 --> 00:28:11,535
oh ah but i started thinking about

822
00:28:11,535 --> 00:28:14,265
like okay have had i seen them

823
00:28:14,685 --> 00:28:18,195
after nine months after we stopped re

824
00:28:18,495 --> 00:28:20,355
dating and have i seen you know

825
00:28:20,355 --> 00:28:21,945
and i and i i think there's

826
00:28:21,945 --> 00:28:24,015
like maybe three hanging threads out there

827
00:28:24,015 --> 00:28:25,995
that like technically i could have like

828
00:28:26,055 --> 00:28:27,195
a twenty

829
00:28:27,705 --> 00:28:29,745
five year old kid out there somewhere

830
00:28:29,745 --> 00:28:33,165
but i think it's very unlikely i

831
00:28:33,195 --> 00:28:34,665
think so sure yeah i think so

832
00:28:35,025 --> 00:28:36,375
but i know lauren like that you

833
00:28:36,375 --> 00:28:38,205
wouldn't have that experience but um no

834
00:28:38,205 --> 00:28:39,255
because i have a vagina

835
00:28:40,275 --> 00:28:42,975
please tell us more no

836
00:28:44,685 --> 00:28:46,155
um i don't even know what you

837
00:28:46,155 --> 00:28:47,715
mean yeah but i mean yeah like

838
00:28:47,715 --> 00:28:49,455
are there any but that's really wonderful

839
00:28:49,815 --> 00:28:53,055
goodnight children you know if i did

840
00:28:53,085 --> 00:28:54,735
yeah um but it's one of those

841
00:28:54,735 --> 00:28:56,265
experiences i mean of like oh are

842
00:28:56,265 --> 00:28:58,245
your parents actually your parents yeah it's

843
00:28:58,245 --> 00:29:00,137
crazy because my parents did twenty three

844
00:29:00,137 --> 00:29:01,785
and me and i just read those

845
00:29:01,785 --> 00:29:03,465
results and that was like i'm fifty

846
00:29:03,465 --> 00:29:04,275
percent of this

847
00:29:05,205 --> 00:29:07,640
oh yeah um i we we did

848
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:08,895
it janie and i did it too

849
00:29:08,895 --> 00:29:11,715
and it was very it was disappointingly

850
00:29:11,745 --> 00:29:13,845
unsurprised i was exactly what we've been

851
00:29:13,845 --> 00:29:15,465
saying yeah but yeah it was like

852
00:29:15,525 --> 00:29:17,415
i was convinced though it was gonna

853
00:29:17,415 --> 00:29:19,845
be some some something different i don't

854
00:29:19,845 --> 00:29:21,825
know why on my dad's side i

855
00:29:21,825 --> 00:29:22,725
was like i don't think we're as

856
00:29:22,725 --> 00:29:24,405
irish as we claim

857
00:29:24,465 --> 00:29:26,415
to be and then it was yeah

858
00:29:26,415 --> 00:29:28,185
definitely was i grew up okay i

859
00:29:28,185 --> 00:29:30,435
grew up saying oh yeah i grew

860
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:32,265
up saying i was german and polish

861
00:29:32,265 --> 00:29:33,765
and i remember always having like deep

862
00:29:33,765 --> 00:29:35,475
shame about the polish part of it

863
00:29:35,475 --> 00:29:36,883
because of all the polish jokes and

864
00:29:36,883 --> 00:29:37,995
when i was growing like that was

865
00:29:37,995 --> 00:29:40,155
a big thing i would tell yeah

866
00:29:40,335 --> 00:29:43,215
well for some reason that was really

867
00:29:43,215 --> 00:29:44,595
big in the eighties doesn't it

868
00:29:44,775 --> 00:29:46,365
i had a book why there's a

869
00:29:46,365 --> 00:29:47,655
book yeah you could buy it like

870
00:29:47,655 --> 00:29:49,275
airports and i remember having a book

871
00:29:49,275 --> 00:29:52,755
that was ah it was ah no

872
00:29:52,755 --> 00:29:54,915
one remembers jokebooks but julius were a

873
00:29:54,915 --> 00:29:57,225
big deal there's a truly tasteless joke

874
00:29:57,225 --> 00:29:58,755
book yeah this but there were a

875
00:29:58,755 --> 00:30:00,012
lot of ethnic joke books and i

876
00:30:00,012 --> 00:30:02,235
remember one that was um it was

877
00:30:02,235 --> 00:30:03,975
an italian joke book on one side

878
00:30:03,975 --> 00:30:04,755
and then you flipped it over

879
00:30:04,755 --> 00:30:06,529
over it was a polish joke on

880
00:30:06,543 --> 00:30:08,325
the other side and the joke part

881
00:30:08,325 --> 00:30:09,765
of the joke being that the covers

882
00:30:09,765 --> 00:30:10,935
on the wrong side because it's the

883
00:30:10,935 --> 00:30:12,105
polish book right right

884
00:30:12,735 --> 00:30:15,795
and i was like hi it was

885
00:30:15,795 --> 00:30:18,195
so weird literally it was two books

886
00:30:18,225 --> 00:30:19,545
i see what you're saying you flip

887
00:30:19,545 --> 00:30:21,075
it upside down it covers going wrong

888
00:30:21,105 --> 00:30:24,285
but i will show i see just

889
00:30:24,285 --> 00:30:25,965
why do we hate polish before that's

890
00:30:26,805 --> 00:30:28,725
that's the thing you really hate them

891
00:30:29,595 --> 00:30:31,035
i could never figure it out because

892
00:30:31,035 --> 00:30:32,805
no one i knew

893
00:30:33,530 --> 00:30:34,670
it's more of a metric maybe it

894
00:30:34,670 --> 00:30:36,350
was more of a metropolitan area type

895
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:37,880
of thing or or certain areas but

896
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:40,790
like we people would tell polish jokes

897
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:41,930
when i was young even though no

898
00:30:41,930 --> 00:30:43,490
one we knew was polish like i've

899
00:30:43,490 --> 00:30:44,570
heard things like that but i don't

900
00:30:44,570 --> 00:30:47,090
know why i understand it as being

901
00:30:47,090 --> 00:30:48,860
a part of the it's it's really

902
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:51,260
weird and it's weird how much of

903
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:52,850
that was just like oh yeah that's

904
00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:53,660
fine i remember

905
00:30:53,690 --> 00:30:56,210
reading some book of facts that the

906
00:30:56,210 --> 00:30:57,770
same jokes that are polish jokes to

907
00:30:57,770 --> 00:31:00,860
us in france are english jokes right

908
00:31:00,863 --> 00:31:02,510
there they're just english people yeah every

909
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:04,430
culture has like has like the cursor

910
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:06,470
they ate yeah it was demonized they

911
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:08,240
say this guy's really stupid but anyway

912
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,650
so i always have big shame of

913
00:31:09,650 --> 00:31:10,910
like people say what are you i

914
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:12,830
would go out german and then if

915
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:13,700
i felt like

916
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:15,561
you look violation i would say oh

917
00:31:15,561 --> 00:31:16,370
a little bit of polish but i

918
00:31:16,370 --> 00:31:18,080
guess because my parents did the twenty

919
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:21,470
three me ah it's mainly swedish or

920
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:23,330
something well you look swedish tomb yeah

921
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:24,860
you'll see that i did not do

922
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:26,720
my own because if i ever murder

923
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,210
someone i don't want that information came

924
00:31:29,210 --> 00:31:30,200

incriminate people for murders i mean that's

928
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,850
kind of good i don't know i

929
00:31:37,850 --> 00:31:39,050
don't like that the murder part but

930
00:31:39,050 --> 00:31:40,490
the um ah

931
00:31:40,850 --> 00:31:42,770
just the concept of murder that's kind

932
00:31:42,770 --> 00:31:45,230
of good people kill me no biggie

933
00:31:45,290 --> 00:31:46,678
what do you think about it guys

934
00:31:46,678 --> 00:31:48,260
something we're using it also for like

935
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:50,690
like ads and like shit like that

936
00:31:50,690 --> 00:31:51,920
where it's like you're basically using it

937
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,840
as sort of a um like way

938
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:56,690
to like demographic yeah okay but then

939
00:31:56,690 --> 00:31:58,818
like using your data for like information

940
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:00,230
so they may be yeah but like

941
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:00,740
i but

942
00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:02,210
it's all evil i think finding a

943
00:32:02,210 --> 00:32:04,040
murderer is kind of a good thing

944
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:05,990
i don't really know who should get

945
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:07,190
away with so do you think that

946
00:32:07,190 --> 00:32:09,530
the government you don't opt for do

947
00:32:09,530 --> 00:32:11,810
you think this is a very childish

948
00:32:11,810 --> 00:32:13,880
world i know who should get away

949
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,650
with murder and i think anyone any

950
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,630
thinking person or do you think the

951
00:32:17,630 --> 00:32:19,550
government should have a database of every

952
00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:20,990
single person's dna like

953
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:22,370
the moment you're born you get your

954
00:32:22,370 --> 00:32:24,680
dna on file it's coming to that

955
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,450
don't you think no like big brother

956
00:32:26,450 --> 00:32:28,430
bullshit they're gonna we're now we're using

957
00:32:28,430 --> 00:32:29,600
our eyeballs to check it on a

958
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:32,090
plane like that's weird it is weird

959
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:33,620
i had you know we have an

960
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:35,690
alexa at home we have we've done

961
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:38,390
twenty-three me um i've given my my

962
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:39,950
fingerprints you know for t s a

963
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:41,030
pre-check though

964
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:43,100
the the final thing for me is

965
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:45,530
the is clear yeah haven't gotten clean

966
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:47,480
because i feel like ejaculate better what

967
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,287
do you have to do i'll be

968
00:32:48,290 --> 00:32:49,627
if you go you can you can

969
00:32:49,670 --> 00:32:50,750
go clean so you have to drink

970
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:52,700
lots of fluids yesterday and you also

971
00:32:52,730 --> 00:32:53,840
have to become a scientist do a

972
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,730
retinal scan and it's like i don't

973
00:32:55,730 --> 00:32:58,070
know why i'm dry i've given you

974
00:32:58,070 --> 00:33:00,140
know given my already like but i

975
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,340
really draw the line at that

976
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:02,660
that what do you say pre-check is

977
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:04,520
enough of a pass through things like

978
00:33:04,730 --> 00:33:05,840
you need to go so fast i

979
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:06,920
got to look at something and then

980
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,570
walk through like where am i going

981
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:10,430
like i'm always early for the airport

982
00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:12,500
it's fine like i don't know well

983
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:13,760
maybe you could come late one day

984
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:14,780
and then just drink it with my

985
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:16,127
eyes and get on the plane thing

986
00:33:16,127 --> 00:33:18,170
it was time you could say anyway

987
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:20,180
i don't know you've i kind of

988
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:21,470
feel like the older i get to

989
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:22,850
it's like you wanna go ahead and

990
00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:24,843
have it this stuff is worthless enough

991
00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:26,870
oh my info is worthless off surrender

992
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:28,370
you know it's like that's why i'm

993
00:33:28,370 --> 00:33:29,690
saying i think it'll happen i think

994
00:33:29,690 --> 00:33:30,860
it'll be a thing where everyone's in

995
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:32,540
a database i don't think they can

996
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:35,060
i think the governor i mean it's

997
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:37,070
the way i keep having psychopaths and

998
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:38,679
charge the problem is is we're giving

999
00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:40,850
a willingly that's that's so that's yeah

1000
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:41,660
exactly you know like

1001
00:33:41,690 --> 00:33:43,250
we're giving up all of our freedoms

1002
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:44,450
well but because of our egos i

1003
00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:45,380

1153
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:26,300
but i feel much that's the yeah

1154
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:27,800
i think like really i'm like oh

1155
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,270
i will if i see we didn't

1156
00:38:29,270 --> 00:38:30,833
have any home movies we have no

1157
00:38:30,833 --> 00:38:33,260
home movies but there's you know there's

1158
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:35,300
obviously pictures when we were little kids

1159
00:38:35,330 --> 00:38:37,100
and obviously more pic

1160
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:39,200
pictures of the older kids and fewer

1161
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:41,450
younger kids know yeah my i think

1162
00:38:41,450 --> 00:38:42,710
my brother had a ton of pictures

1163
00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:44,840
and then i'm the middle so i

1164
00:38:44,870 --> 00:38:46,610
think i have like a few babies

1165
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,440
yeah and then i jumped to six

1166
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:51,050
or so yeah but then i i

1167
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:53,420
i remember there were and i think

1168
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:54,740
i may have talked about this before

1169
00:38:54,770 --> 00:38:56,510
i remember i got a pen ready

1170
00:38:56,570 --> 00:38:57,260
i remember bringing it

1171
00:38:57,290 --> 00:39:00,470
find things they would ah they would

1172
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:02,360
like get out the camera because we

1173
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:04,730
loved having our pictures taken but we

1174
00:39:04,730 --> 00:39:06,410
didn't have any concept of pictures getting

1175
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:08,305
developed or anything so they would just

1176
00:39:08,305 --> 00:39:09,830
sleep them in real film in the

1177
00:39:09,830 --> 00:39:11,810
camera it would just be oh my

1178
00:39:11,810 --> 00:39:14,870
god why me so you loved having

1179
00:39:14,870 --> 00:39:16,370
your picture taken you just like the

1180
00:39:16,370 --> 00:39:17,420
original you for

1181
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:18,440
get about it you know what i

1182
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:21,718
mean yeah nah six years out from

1183
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:24,200
no i do think it's weird that

1184
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,910
little kids now can immediately see the

1185
00:39:25,910 --> 00:39:27,590
picture and they want to yeah i

1186
00:39:27,590 --> 00:39:28,640
think it's weird i think gives you

1187
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:29,990
a weird sense of yourself from a

1188
00:39:29,990 --> 00:39:31,550
young age pile be really funny shit

1189
00:39:31,550 --> 00:39:34,130
future because it's like just because we

1190
00:39:34,130 --> 00:39:35,990
grew up having to develop pictures you

1191
00:39:35,990 --> 00:39:37,460
think everyone should have to know

1192
00:39:37,895 --> 00:39:39,470
ellen yeah but don't you think that

1193
00:39:39,470 --> 00:39:41,420
there's something about your the way self

1194
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:43,130
is a strong stance but the waiter

1195
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:47,390
ran away yourself esteemed develops without like

1196
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:49,700
having a ton of mirrors cameras that

1197
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:51,020
you're watching the video back and forth

1198
00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:52,369
like pictures that you can look at

1199
00:39:52,369 --> 00:39:53,540
directly after they take them so you

1200
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:55,130
see what you'll like right now instantly

1201
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:57,230
you think that you your self-esteem develops

1202
00:39:57,260 --> 00:39:57,740
without have

1203
00:39:57,740 --> 00:39:59,420
owing any concept of what you look

1204
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:00,590
like to other people i think it's

1205
00:40:00,590 --> 00:40:02,300
better i think i thought i was

1206
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:03,770
gross and that's fine but i had

1207
00:40:03,770 --> 00:40:06,410
to choose know your gross you're gross

1208
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:07,190
i don't think it would have been

1209
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:08,420
helpful for me to see a bunch

1210
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:10,760
of pictures as when your brain is

1211
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:12,920
really like developing when you're really little

1212
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,420
like babies whenever want to see it

1213
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:15,950
i'm like why do they understand the

1214
00:40:15,950 --> 00:40:17,900
concept of there being i hate

1215
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:21,200
pictures of me we had um five

1216
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,510
or six family photos you know like

1217
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:25,400
every three or four years we would

1218
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:28,220
go to our church friends who were

1219
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:30,590
of ah he was a photographer we'd

1220
00:40:30,590 --> 00:40:33,020
go to them take the posed family

1221
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:35,330
photo and we put five of those

1222
00:40:35,330 --> 00:40:37,190
framed in the hallway leading into our

1223
00:40:37,190 --> 00:40:38,060
house and i hated

1224
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:41,660
because if you knew anytime i had

1225
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:43,070
a friend over they would go through

1226
00:40:43,070 --> 00:40:44,300
that hall and they go huh you

1227
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:46,908

00:40:49,490 --> 00:40:51,200
fine they're just like they're just kinda

1231
00:40:51,290 --> 00:40:52,670
young a moment in time lecturing about

1232
00:40:52,670 --> 00:40:54,650
but because you're like three years younger

1233
00:40:54,650 --> 00:40:57,440
weird thing oh no it's so embarrassing

1234
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:58,910

00:42:37,070 --> 00:42:38,330
it did you see the whole roll

1284
00:42:38,330 --> 00:42:40,100
and he was furious no three was

1285
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:41,000
it was like it was just a

1286
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,560
snapshot that was in with a bunch

1287
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,270
of other pictures wow and i looked

1288
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:45,830
at him like oh my god why

1289
00:42:45,830 --> 00:42:48,350
is the sun spread it's it's not

1290
00:42:48,350 --> 00:42:50,150
but who knows what happened right before

1291
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:51,650
that i would take a yeah

1292
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:53,240
just don't have one i have a

1293
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:54,560
vague memory of it but it's like

1294
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:57,020
i think i was i think it

1295
00:42:57,020 --> 00:42:58,460
was like after high school like i

1296
00:42:58,460 --> 00:43:00,380
think we were all like young adult

1297
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:01,640
like my yeah there's no we're young

1298
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:03,890
adults it's it's weird but hear that

1299
00:43:04,190 --> 00:43:06,140
it's just one photo that's why anytime

1300
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:07,400
you see like a photo from the

1301
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:08,780
white house or something like that where

1302
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:11,600
people are like staring at the president

1303
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:12,110
and they're oh

1304
00:43:12,170 --> 00:43:14,000
you can tell he's hates him or

1305
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,220
whatever yeah it's like it's just one

1306
00:43:16,250 --> 00:43:18,680
image it says like two seconds later

1307
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:21,200
he's probably smiling right but yeah i

1308
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:22,820
hated going to those things in the

1309
00:43:22,820 --> 00:43:24,530
poses you had to do and the

1310
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:25,850
put your arm on this and put

1311
00:43:25,850 --> 00:43:26,930
your arm on this but now they're

1312
00:43:26,930 --> 00:43:29,240
fun and ironic yes although i think

1313
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:30,050
there are ten people who still do

1314
00:43:30,050 --> 00:43:31,670
it for real right i never liked

1315
00:43:31,670 --> 00:43:32,270
the ah

1316
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:34,635
the school photographer like the the yeah

1317
00:43:34,635 --> 00:43:36,440
the hell i because i was i

1318
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:38,060
was embarrassed of my teeth because i

1319
00:43:38,060 --> 00:43:39,110
had i had a gap of my

1320
00:43:39,110 --> 00:43:40,460
teeth and i had a broken game

1321
00:43:40,490 --> 00:43:42,710
for longest i had a broken tooth

1322
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:44,148
for the longest time and so i

1323
00:43:44,148 --> 00:43:45,410
didn't want to smile with my teeth

1324
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:47,660
right and so the the guy would

1325
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:50,990
always whoever it was every year would

1326
00:43:50,990 --> 00:43:52,017
try to make my

1327
00:43:52,683 --> 00:43:53,810
i don't want to do it and

1328
00:43:53,810 --> 00:43:56,930
they have their stupid as york today

1329
00:43:56,930 --> 00:43:59,480
like bonuses if you smile there are

1330
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:00,860
some i mean i think it's more

1331
00:44:00,890 --> 00:44:02,300
or is it just a pathetic you

1332
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:03,680
know it's if you don't yeah not

1333
00:44:03,710 --> 00:44:05,660
now do like a thing where you

1334
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:06,620
can pick what you want like i'll

1335
00:44:06,623 --> 00:44:08,450
give you three digital options or something

1336
00:44:08,450 --> 00:44:10,280
because maybe i hated that it was

1337
00:44:10,310 --> 00:44:11,810
very still on and done and if

1338
00:44:11,810 --> 00:44:12,590
you didn't like it like

1339
00:44:12,620 --> 00:44:14,120
you could do retakes and that's your

1340
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:15,890
only other chance here i have i

1341
00:44:15,890 --> 00:44:16,910

1342
00:44:16,910 --> 00:44:18,230

1358
00:44:49,310 --> 00:44:51,170

00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,350
everyone knows the distinction

1464
00:48:13,220 --> 00:48:14,930
ah this is going to be two

1465
00:48:14,930 --> 00:48:17,210
against one we team up against one

1466
00:48:17,210 --> 00:48:19,430
guesser to give clues that strike a

1467
00:48:19,430 --> 00:48:22,190
balance between too easy and too hard

1468
00:48:22,310 --> 00:48:24,380
it's kind of like twenty questions but

1469
00:48:24,380 --> 00:48:26,060
the only question the guesser can ask

1470
00:48:26,060 --> 00:48:28,670
is how's yours so here's what it'll

1471
00:48:28,670 --> 00:48:30,230
happen one of us will leave the

1472
00:48:30,230 --> 00:48:31,790
room i i'm guessing it will be

1473
00:48:31,790 --> 00:48:32,120
paul

1474
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:35,780
um paul leaves the room or i

1475
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:36,950
could cover my ears and hum a

1476
00:48:36,950 --> 00:48:38,900
tune it says good but i want

1477
00:48:38,900 --> 00:48:40,940
you to leave the room meanwhile lauren

1478
00:48:40,940 --> 00:48:42,620
and i will come up with something

1479
00:48:42,620 --> 00:48:44,570
that everyone the three of us has

1480
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:46,820
owns or has a few examples might

1481
00:48:46,820 --> 00:48:49,190
be an email account a passport i'm

1482
00:48:49,190 --> 00:48:50,692
assuming we all have a passport of

1483
00:48:50,692 --> 00:48:51,920
astra i think we've all but yeah

1484
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:52,604
we've all been out of the

1485
00:48:52,670 --> 00:48:54,851
entry together we all passports right we

1486
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:57,740
yeah australia together strong or australia we

1487
00:48:57,740 --> 00:49:00,230
were down under a refrigerator or a

1488
00:49:00,230 --> 00:49:02,300
degree well why would everyone have a

1489
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:04,670
degree that's a little rude that's really

1490
00:49:04,670 --> 00:49:07,760
elite game league game once we've decided

1491
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:10,970
lorna and i decided um yeah paul

1492
00:49:10,970 --> 00:49:12,830
comes back in and approaches

1493
00:49:14,030 --> 00:49:15,950
approaches us with or or one of

1494
00:49:15,950 --> 00:49:18,770
us great trepidation yeah approaches scared like

1495
00:49:18,770 --> 00:49:20,690
someone from a certain neighborhood in iran

1496
00:49:21,830 --> 00:49:25,640
ah certain neighbourhood in iraq yeah we

1497
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:26,450
take you now

1498
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:29,780
so ah you approached us with the

1499
00:49:29,780 --> 00:49:32,450
question how's yours the question person i

1500
00:49:32,450 --> 00:49:33,800
guess that would be you come to

1501
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:36,410
one of us gives a truthful clue

1502
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:38,630
that will eventually help the guesser figure

1503
00:49:38,630 --> 00:49:40,430
it out but nothing too vague or

1504
00:49:40,430 --> 00:49:42,890
nothing too obvious the guesser is only

1505
00:49:42,890 --> 00:49:45,560
allowed one guess per clue given and

1506
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:47,430
the guesser can either go around asking

1507
00:49:47,430 --> 00:49:47,630
if

1508
00:49:47,630 --> 00:49:49,760
fair circle or pick on people indiscriminately

1509
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:51,020
for clues was only a couple of

1510
00:49:51,020 --> 00:49:53,210
us so vague clues like minds made

1511
00:49:53,210 --> 00:49:55,400
of matter or mine's pretty good are

1512
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:57,950
pointless because the guesser will never get

1513
00:49:57,950 --> 00:49:59,990
any closer beings made of matter who

1514
00:50:00,020 --> 00:50:02,120
would say that nerd it's got if

1515
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:03,890
you're close to obvious and the guesser

1516
00:50:03,890 --> 00:50:05,660
guesses the object on your clue then

1517
00:50:05,660 --> 00:50:07,610
you lose and you're the next guesser

1518
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:09,590
if the item is a passport for

1519
00:50:09,590 --> 00:50:11,150
example you probably don't want to say

1520
00:50:11,390 --> 00:50:13,430
minus full of stamps why wouldn't you

1521
00:50:13,430 --> 00:50:16,040
say minus full of stamps well yeah

1522
00:50:16,070 --> 00:50:18,380
because there's already knew anything no one

1523
00:50:18,410 --> 00:50:20,660
else is full of stamps my spa

1524
00:50:20,672 --> 00:50:22,850
container boxes stay up in there at

1525
00:50:22,850 --> 00:50:24,740
them pretty fast better clues for past

1526
00:50:24,740 --> 00:50:27,140
budget tramp here's some here's their examples

1527
00:50:27,140 --> 00:50:27,950
of better clues for

1528
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:30,200
passport mine might have been worth something

1529
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:32,840
in the black market or mine has

1530
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:35,570
an expiration date alright get out of

1531
00:50:35,570 --> 00:50:38,000
the room get out so now just

1532
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,340
to just review the only question i'm

1533
00:50:40,340 --> 00:50:42,170
allowed to ask is how's yours and

1534
00:50:42,170 --> 00:50:43,760
you have to ask it to an

1535
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:46,820
alternate and go back we assume you

1536
00:50:46,820 --> 00:50:47,960
have it okay

1537
00:50:48,750 --> 00:50:50,460
i'm not but just assume it's something

1538
00:50:50,460 --> 00:50:52,110
i'd have is something common that most

1539
00:50:52,110 --> 00:50:53,430
people have is we're not gonna say

1540
00:50:53,430 --> 00:50:55,080
it's something that all schools yeah it's

1541
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:56,284
gonna be it's gonna be

1542
00:50:58,112 --> 00:50:59,220
so i can only ask the oh

1543
00:50:59,220 --> 00:51:00,986
yeah hold on i just want to

1544
00:51:00,986 --> 00:51:02,100

yes i think you guess every single

1548
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:09,002
time there's no consequence of you getting

1549
00:51:09,002 --> 00:51:11,070
