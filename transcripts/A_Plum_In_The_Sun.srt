1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,290
thereto

2
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:08,760
oh

3
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:17,520
oh ma do you know what that

4
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,528

5
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:21,600
i was thinking about the malarkey i

6
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,160
enjoyed every time i hear it i

7
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,150
was thinking about it the other day

8
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:25,080
welcome to three and by the way

9
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:26,280

11
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:30,000

was gonna tell you and then i

16
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:41,340
thought i don't think they refer to

17
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:43,770
themselves as q and i were queuing

18
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:46,020
on oh ding dong hai work you

19
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,150
know yeah i'm sure whatever they do

20
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:50,160
it's really cool i was thinking about

21
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:51,390
when we came up with the title

22
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:53,250
of it and then we premiered it

23
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:55,020
at comic-con and everyone it was met

24
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:57,300
with a collective shrug oh yeah that

25
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:00,660
panel really sucked that was uncomfortable and

26
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:01,950
we almost didn't do the show but

27
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:04,050
then here's here's the other thing i

28
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:05,850
was thinking about was like did the

29
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:07,260
theme song save it

30
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:10,440
look the theme son does a lot

31
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,480
to see lot of the heavy weight

32
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,640
but but you know the name just

33
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:16,050
it doesn't matter a whole lot a

34
00:01:16,055 --> 00:01:17,700
second we didn't have this we didn't

35
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,380
have the we started recording before we

36
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:21,870
had the final name and stricter oh

37
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:22,830
that's right we were trying to figure

38
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:24,413
out the name of the person we

39
00:01:24,413 --> 00:01:26,340
didn't have the theme song yet but

40
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:27,780
we but we went back and laid

41
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:28,560
in the theme song i

42
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:29,970
think of course we did for what

43
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:32,910
i'm saying with three dm as a

44
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:35,040

196
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:44,340
what do you mean you did that

197
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:45,660
there like now where you walked in

198
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:46,500
the center of town

199
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:49,650
yeah but it's a literal soapbox we

200
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:52,650
did it as as a dinging dinging

201
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,260
in a presentation to like local high

202
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:56,820
schools or whatever they all filled it

203
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:58,253
like a big auditorium and we did

204
00:06:58,253 --> 00:07:00,120
like to demonstrate what acting is yeah

205
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,920
this is if you work really hard

206
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:04,020
you can act like this when you

207
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:06,240
kill who did you kill no why

208
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,680
do you kill a lot of tears

209
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,236
rs lot of tears in that from

210
00:07:09,236 --> 00:07:10,860
my story and it was a west

211
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:13,530
side story romeo and juliet mashup oh

212
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:15,000
no where i'd already put it in

213
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,680
and it was actually really good where

214
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:18,570
did romeo and juliet meet tonia maria

215
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,260
because here like we can't meet each

216
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:24,900
other this will disrupt the space time

217
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:27,779
continuum and juliet get together romeo and

218
00:07:27,779 --> 00:07:30,870
maria but it was um they took

219
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:33,120
scenes from romeo and juliet and like

220
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:35,820
underscored them with west side story music

221
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:37,980
and then it kept like going back

222
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:40,140
and forth from tony and maria to

223
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:40,530
romeo

224
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:42,330

267
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:18,870
where i kind of assume and lay

268
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:22,380
where you there are attractive people on

269
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:23,190
both ends of that

270
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:27,184
deal new customers and waitresses that you

271
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:29,490
get people hooking up not to get

272
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:31,080
too far into restaurant roundup but

273
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:34,290
i i think i remember a couple

274
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:36,540
of times where like a fellow waitress

275
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:39,030
would say like oh i'm going on

276
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:41,130
a date with like this customer or

277
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:43,080
whatever and it always seemed like it

278
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,970
was because just because you jealous well

279
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:45,390

280
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:48,450
because i i'd asked them out and

281
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:49,560
they were telling you why they were

282
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,240

289
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,560
always same thing even though it doesn't

290
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:20,077

291
00:10:20,077 --> 00:10:22,330

292
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:24,670

319
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,720
but remember i told you about that

320
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:29,080

324
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:35,080
was like ok this is great because

325
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,720

327
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,730
here on um you know i can

328
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,620
i can make different decisions like this

329
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:47,020
like i really relate to make diversions

330
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:48,430
from but i'm not going to ruin

331
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:50,980
my relationship yes exactly but what if

332
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:51,730
you make great does

333
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:53,740
visions and it does ruin your relationship

334
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,730
well i'm not gonna do that but

335
00:11:57,730 --> 00:11:58,120
why

336
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:00,763
i'm just not going to do oh

337
00:12:00,763 --> 00:12:01,180
why

338
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:05,436
right but okay so wanting you to

339
00:12:05,436 --> 00:12:06,723
i guess you would have you and

340
00:12:06,723 --> 00:12:08,770
have a chance to course correct at

341
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:09,880
that point do you know what i

342
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,680
mean yeah like if you if you

343
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,183
made a decision that was different than

344
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:15,580
the decision made before but then it

345
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:18,610
started to negatively impact something else right

346
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:21,070
i feel like you being the all-knowing

347
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:21,760
person

348
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,520
would um that you have knowledge that

349
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,990
other people do not have you know

350
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:28,120
of the alternate universe that you've already

351
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,700
lived right so then you could

352
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:33,880
it's like groundhog day you could you

353
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,920

women think about this where i'm saying

497
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:51,460
it was so weird i would never

498
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:52,480
even look at a high school i

499
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,290
want to do them when i was

500
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,300
a freshman in college however there's full

501
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:57,010
on forty plus year old men that

502
00:17:57,010 --> 00:17:58,870
we know who have not know personally

503
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:00,790
but we know of who dated women

504
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:03,310
younger than that yeah right yeah disgusting

505
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,930
like i when you are

506
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:05,530
looking at me

507
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:08,830
when you know you can screencap snapchat

508
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:13,630
like when a guy is fifteen that's

509
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:17,110
like really vast when i'm nineteen a

510
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:21,700
guy is fifteen that is really vase

511
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:23,650
anyway woody allen is what i'm thinking

512
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,870
of but right well um can i

513
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:26,770
ask you do

514
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:29,140
do you think the chicago of it

515
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:32,740
all is something that you related to

516
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:34,600
and that led to you guys liking

517
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,100
each other or is that sort of

518
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,660
like a bonus where it's like oh

519
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:39,340
cool and he also is from chicago

520
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:41,680
it's both i think when i first

521
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,730
met him so we had to like

522
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:45,580
have they had they sort of wanted

523
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:46,930
us to meet up as a cat

524
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:48,970
just before we started this the pilot

525
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:51,280
right and we i met up with

526
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,740
him at um lot wait separately you

527
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:55,360
were all supposed to meet well no

528
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,500
i was gonna meet a few people

529
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,430
but he got him i got there

530
00:18:57,430 --> 00:18:59,320
first we want you to pair off

531
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:01,270
and have snarky meeting groups of twos

532
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:02,770
and i got there either to take

533
00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:05,350
a month and there was gonna be

534
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,060
one other person joining us

535
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:08,320
i don't know why it was just

536
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:09,910
that group that time but we all

537
00:19:09,910 --> 00:19:12,430
met up at different times i got

538
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:15,280
there first and he joined me and

539
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:17,710
hugh we figured out all these connections

540
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:19,060
that we were both from the same

541
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:19,870
area and they were like a lot

542
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:21,280
more other little things like that like

543
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,650
sort of but i really thought he

544
00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:25,540
was like kind of a frat guy

545
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:27,250
or something like i i totally had

546
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,050
the wrong was because he's in the

547
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:31,390
bruise brothers that came later

548
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:34,870
but i totally had the wrong impression

549
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:37,030
of him and i remember it wasn't

550
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:39,100
because of how we dressed or how

551
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:41,830
he acted or what he drove i

552
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:43,750
i didn't see what we're watching that

553
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,400
he had no it's i guess it

554
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,260
was his clothes which wouldn't i don't

555
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:48,730
really remember probably like a button-down and

556
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:50,020
some jean you know probably not right

557
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,700
he doesn't change his style and he

558
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:52,690
weighed between then and now

559
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:55,330
oh yeah he knew taylor molino weird

560
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:57,580
or now oh but he at the

561
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:59,274
time i just don't really i just

562
00:19:59,343 --> 00:20:00,160
i don't know if i even thought

563
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,150
about it but i was just it

564
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:02,680
was just like a vibe and i

565
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,820
think what he's talking about chicago it

566
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:05,470
was like oh my dad went to

567
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:06,910
the same high school that mike went

568
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:08,380
to like a lot of weird things

569
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,940
though was he talking about the super

570
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:11,890
bowl shuffle a lot or i just

571
00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:12,700
had this feeling

572
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,330
like there were all those like l

573
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:16,470
a girls around me and i was

574
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:17,340
like oh he'd rather be talking to

575
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:20,490
them which is a show because it's

576
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:22,800
so not true was fine and in

577
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:25,110
retrospect now that you've spoke i'm presume

578
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:26,849
you've spoken to him about this he

579
00:20:26,871 --> 00:20:28,110
talks a little bit what what

580
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:32,760
was he was would he rather have

581
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,290
talked to you on that night yeah

582
00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:35,550
he was so excited to talk to

583
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:36,960
me because he already knew who i

584
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,510
was from improv stuff and so conditioning

585
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:42,090
and my babysitting career that he was

586
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:44,520
he already like was excited to like

587
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:45,870
he was like thinking we'll get along

588
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:48,872
right but i just just was you

589
00:20:48,872 --> 00:20:49,080
were

590
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:53,220
only farming yeah guys wow oh this

591
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:55,140
job i much rather talk to the

592
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:57,900
model i was married but also i

593
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:59,940
was so i wasn't just trying to

594
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:00,930
he wasn't like flirting with me but

595
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:02,550
i'm saying there was just a feeling

596
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:04,500
of like you imagine oh this you

597
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,600
know meeting an actor i'm like oh

598
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,770
he's an actor you know i didn't

599
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:09,660
get his whole background immediate

600
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,610
yeah plus someone who moves out to

601
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:13,050
l a to be an actor who's

602
00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:16,440
like good-looking like him you probably assume

603
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,850
that oh this dude just wants to

604
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:19,710
like rape you remind me a lot

605
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:21,540
of people like that to me like

606
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,510
whatever but rpi you meet a lot

607
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:28,740
of guys who are actors who are

608
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:29,790
not fun

609
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:32,400
yeah yeah so i just didn't expect

610
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,100
to be enjoying the time and i

611
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:36,180
figured he would rather be talking to

612
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:37,500
someone else but then he was great

613
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,060
and then we were joined by matt

614
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:40,980
cooke whose from the groundlings who's hilarious

615
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:42,630
and it was we all got along

616
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:44,400
so well you know what's funny is

617
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,200
that i liked mike more when i

618
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,240

be scrubbed and more there's too much

767
00:27:22,290 --> 00:27:23,640

was such a

967
00:34:34,375 --> 00:34:38,245
an inherent ah fluidity between comedy and

968
00:34:38,245 --> 00:34:39,835
music people that would come to those

969
00:34:39,835 --> 00:34:41,755

970
00:34:41,755 --> 00:34:43,525

she sees every um ah not every

1209
00:42:58,090 --> 00:42:59,740
drama but every everything that has any

1210
00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:04,210
kind of um ah mysterious element to

1211
00:43:04,210 --> 00:43:06,340
it where there's you know like if

1212
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:08,260
it's if it's a crime thing a

1213
00:43:08,260 --> 00:43:11,080
mystery something like that she sees mr

1214
00:43:11,290 --> 00:43:12,760
foot not just that she sees it

1215
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:13,570
as a challenge

1216
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:15,610
to guess what is going oh yeah

1217
00:43:15,970 --> 00:43:17,766
oh and constantly offer those guesses yeah

1218
00:43:17,766 --> 00:43:21,370
yes ev running guesses and then she

1219
00:43:21,370 --> 00:43:23,020
has to update like okay he didn't

1220
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:24,850
die so this is what i think

1221
00:43:24,850 --> 00:43:27,640
is right yeah see like us tells

1222
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:28,990
me what he thinks is gonna happen

1223
00:43:28,990 --> 00:43:31,030
not necessarily a mystery but like just

1224
00:43:31,030 --> 00:43:32,770
a show you're like oh they're gonna

1225
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:33,760
do this and like

1226
00:43:33,850 --> 00:43:35,650
just based on the writing yes i'm

1227
00:43:35,650 --> 00:43:37,780
like oh my god i did not

1228
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:39,400
think of that and now i know

1229
00:43:39,430 --> 00:43:40,390
and then it does happen then i'm

1230
00:43:40,390 --> 00:43:43,330
like yeah great guy because tv i

1231
00:43:43,330 --> 00:43:46,360
really try not to assume i know

1232
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:48,460
what's gonna happen even from a writing

1233
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:50,530
standpoint of like just from paying more

1234
00:43:50,530 --> 00:43:52,360
attention or being in things you start

1235
00:43:52,370 --> 00:43:53,770
to understand it more and whatever

1236
00:43:54,430 --> 00:43:55,720
i don't want to do that because

1237
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:56,950
i like to just watch you like

1238
00:43:56,950 --> 00:43:58,600
to be right in it well sometimes

1239
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:00,190
though like you know because cool up

1240
00:44:00,190 --> 00:44:02,500
and i both write stuff sometimes it's

1241
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:03,790
nice to go like oh by the

1242
00:44:03,790 --> 00:44:05,080
way this is what we were talking

1243
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:06,730
about earlier this is the right to

1244
00:44:06,730 --> 00:44:08,800
exist good way to learn stuff but

1245
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:10,570
then i and i get why it's

1246
00:44:10,570 --> 00:44:12,070
fun but then makes it was like

1247
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:14,080
what's wrong with like he thinks so

1248
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:16,180
spoil my obsession with spoilers is a

1249
00:44:16,180 --> 00:44:18,790
problem because he thinks that it should

1250
00:44:18,790 --> 00:44:20,350
just be like if you already know

1251
00:44:20,350 --> 00:44:21,610
then you can watch for how they

1252
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:23,680
got there though and then i'm like

1253
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:25,300
yeah but i want why would you

1254
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:29,140
watch anything then i i he thinks

1255
00:44:29,140 --> 00:44:31,510
it's fun he he appreciates the journey

1256
00:44:31,810 --> 00:44:33,940
i like you like you're like i

1257
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:34,240
like the

1258
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:35,800
journey and the destination can i have

1259
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:37,420
both i want to not have any

1260
00:44:37,450 --> 00:44:38,680
clue where anything is going on my

1261
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:40,180
tend to not be very good at

1262
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:41,950
predicting one of the first movies that

1263
00:44:41,950 --> 00:44:43,810
i saw with coop was um obviously

1264
00:44:43,810 --> 00:44:45,790
blade we talked about that but obviously

1265
00:44:45,820 --> 00:44:48,280
six cents which by the way these

1266
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:50,530
two movie choices even though she said

1267
00:44:50,530 --> 00:44:52,780
she was scared itself you can't blame

1268
00:44:52,780 --> 00:44:54,160
me for thinking that she's fine with

1269
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:54,400
scare

1270
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:55,750
the stuff when those are two of

1271
00:44:55,750 --> 00:44:57,820
the first movies that we see together

1272
00:44:57,970 --> 00:45:00,130
cool point um so i held onto

1273
00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:01,660
that forever when i wouldn't have gotten

1274
00:45:01,660 --> 00:45:03,340
to the mexican devil mask twenty years

1275
00:45:03,340 --> 00:45:05,500
later and you say you saw six

1276
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:06,070
cents

1277
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:10,510
oh well let's extend but i guess

1278
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:11,950
i guess she told me later she's

1279
00:45:11,950 --> 00:45:13,450
terrified out of her mind during sixth

1280
00:45:13,450 --> 00:45:14,830
sense but wanted to go because i

1281
00:45:14,830 --> 00:45:16,967
wanted to go into skid scares it's

1282
00:45:16,990 --> 00:45:18,400
very scary but sir at a certain

1283
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:19,780
point i figured out the big twist

1284
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:21,640
and would you lean over and say

1285
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:25,420
oh no i went oh and she

1286
00:45:25,420 --> 00:45:26,920

wanna show it off it was the

1328
00:46:54,970 --> 00:46:56,740
style at the time and now they're

1329
00:46:56,740 --> 00:46:59,260
wearing board shorts i know i wonder

1330
00:46:59,260 --> 00:47:01,690
what it'll be next mid i hope

1331
00:47:01,690 --> 00:47:01,933
it's like

1332
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:03,610
i get even shorter i think they

1333
00:47:03,610 --> 00:47:05,620
should get even longer like kevin smith

1334
00:47:06,910 --> 00:47:08,080
it's a shorts to come up to

1335
00:47:08,260 --> 00:47:10,270
me it's so funny how his style

1336
00:47:10,270 --> 00:47:12,100
has been stayed exactly the same while

1337
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:14,050
he has shrunk about fifty percent yeah

1338
00:47:14,230 --> 00:47:15,520
well he had all those custom things

1339
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:17,128
made is that what it is although

1340
00:47:17,128 --> 00:47:18,640
those hockey jerseys i think they're all

1341
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:20,260
custom and then the idea of them

1342
00:47:20,260 --> 00:47:22,840
taking them i don't know i don't

1343
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:23,650

00:47:25,210 --> 00:47:27,370
oversized kevin be the fourth person on

1345
00:47:27,370 --> 00:47:29,860
ford okay that's it that's so finally

1346
00:47:29,890 --> 00:47:31,480

1347
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:34,570
not very ah sorry mary you're no

00:47:47,770 --> 00:47:49,420
airline did not like what you heard

1355
00:47:49,450 --> 00:47:50,740

1356
00:47:52,150 --> 00:47:53,080
i was like this is the first

1357
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:54,580
one you've ever heard they're called features

1358
00:47:55,690 --> 00:47:57,130
literally we do it every time huh

1359
00:47:57,640 --> 00:47:59,770
um didn't know but do we do

1360
00:47:59,770 --> 00:48:01,390
that episode where we're over their shoulders

1361
00:48:01,390 --> 00:48:02,800
going you can do it honey come

1362
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:04,330
on do we go over or do

1363
00:48:04,330 --> 00:48:05,470
we just walk away and let them

1364
00:48:05,470 --> 00:48:07,570
do walk away no week we said

1365
00:48:07,630 --> 00:48:09,130
here and we go shut up don't

1366
00:48:09,130 --> 00:48:11,920
say that wrong not true

1367
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:15,460
cutting that cutting that are there's two

1368
00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:16,540
sides to that story

1369
00:48:18,220 --> 00:48:19,660
what's the gas that you've heard about

1370
00:48:19,660 --> 00:48:22,150
me on descartes oh yeah i why

1371
00:48:22,210 --> 00:48:23,290
already brought up the one about your

1372
00:48:23,290 --> 00:48:25,210
cd collecting and so it made the

1373
00:48:25,210 --> 00:48:26,320
reason i even thought of it because

1374
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:27,820
you were just mentioning that you have

1375
00:48:27,820 --> 00:48:29,286
a log of the shows you've been

1376
00:48:29,290 --> 00:48:31,210
to and that's rather like you have

1377
00:48:31,210 --> 00:48:34,990
a you have a desire to collect

1378
00:48:35,020 --> 00:48:37,540
log store well i'll tell you why

1379
00:48:37,540 --> 00:48:37,840
i stay

1380
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:38,890
i'm doing the broadway thing and that

1381
00:48:38,890 --> 00:48:40,720
was recently because i was trying to

1382
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:42,100
think of a show that i had

1383
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:44,170
seen and i was saying like oh

1384
00:48:44,170 --> 00:48:45,460
it's like this show that i saw

1385
00:48:45,460 --> 00:48:47,350
but i can't remember anything about it

1386
00:48:48,130 --> 00:48:50,110
and so i was like it's this

1387
00:48:50,110 --> 00:48:53,110
thing i think it's based on like

1388
00:48:53,110 --> 00:48:54,730
it's an updated raisin in the sun

1389
00:48:54,730 --> 00:48:56,470
or something like i was like what

1390
00:48:56,470 --> 00:48:58,000
is ate a plum in the sun

1391
00:48:58,210 --> 00:48:58,720
yeah

1392
00:48:59,950 --> 00:49:03,850
so in the snow so it's

1393
00:49:05,950 --> 00:49:07,780
and i couldn't you guys think raisins

1394
00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:09,790
go wow i thought no it would

1395
00:49:09,790 --> 00:49:11,200
be a different this would be hid

1396
00:49:11,260 --> 00:49:14,440
that's an upgrade bigger wow way plums

1397
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:16,900
turn into what plums turn into dates

1398
00:49:16,990 --> 00:49:19,630
dates and grocery grapes turn into ray's

1399
00:49:19,690 --> 00:49:22,270
yeah i'm starting two dates yeah i

1400
00:49:22,270 --> 00:49:24,640
think so no um um yeah what

1401
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:25,060
do what do

1402
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:27,820
runes are for prunes that's maybe prelims

1403
00:49:27,820 --> 00:49:29,860
qualms problems or rune slums your brand

1404
00:49:29,890 --> 00:49:31,466
dates or just dates there never any

1405
00:49:31,489 --> 00:49:32,710
i thought they were their own states

1406
00:49:32,710 --> 00:49:34,420
or just dates yeah they just come

1407
00:49:34,420 --> 00:49:37,330

00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:54,850
in there but nah i don't think

1416
00:49:54,910 --> 00:49:56,110
well i think it's queen we gotta

1417
00:49:56,110 --> 00:49:57,820
go we have to go back to

1418
00:49:57,820 --> 00:49:59,980
the tamu chancellor happened this year it

1419
00:49:59,980 --> 00:50:01,210
might happen this year they will do

1420
00:50:01,210 --> 00:50:02,650
it this year anyway i was gonna

1421
00:50:02,650 --> 00:50:03,820
say i was just trying to think

1422
00:50:03,820 --> 00:50:05,410
of this show jan's

1423
00:50:05,650 --> 00:50:07,690
i had to then i remembered what

1424
00:50:07,690 --> 00:50:10,480
theater it was i was so i

1425
00:50:10,810 --> 00:50:12,910
instead looked up the theater on wikipedia

1426
00:50:12,910 --> 00:50:14,560
and all of it's notable productions until

1427
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:15,670
i finally found it i was like

1428
00:50:15,670 --> 00:50:17,350
you know what i like with the

1429
00:50:17,350 --> 00:50:19,600
inheritance the fact that you guys could

1430
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:21,760
remember the title and i couldn't ah

1431
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:23,140
that would drive me crazy so instead

1432
00:50:23,140 --> 00:50:24,220
i just have a list of like

1433
00:50:24,250 --> 00:50:25,600
i really loved that show every every

1434
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:26,830
the ones that have been shut down

1435
00:50:26,830 --> 00:50:29,740
like unceremoniously well it it was up

1436
00:50:29,740 --> 00:50:32,680
for tony's yeah it didn't have the

1437
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:34,270
long run that it should have so

1438
00:50:34,270 --> 00:50:35,560
that's weird i'm glad we get to

1439
00:50:35,560 --> 00:50:36,370
see it i guess i don't know

1440
00:50:36,370 --> 00:50:37,930
how long run you can do of

1441
00:50:37,930 --> 00:50:39,370
a show that that that is that

1442
00:50:39,370 --> 00:50:41,860
long oh really you gotta think you

1443
00:50:41,860 --> 00:50:43,360
can do it you know for i

1444
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:45,310
mean standard broadway contracts i think are

1445
00:50:45,310 --> 00:50:45,700
thirteen

1446
00:50:46,375 --> 00:50:49,135
and that that everything is can you

1447
00:50:49,135 --> 00:50:51,475
imagine saying it because it's always a

1448
00:50:51,475 --> 00:50:53,365
shower i mean they don't do they

1449
00:50:53,365 --> 00:50:54,805
don't do it all day every time

1450
00:50:55,525 --> 00:50:56,995
thank you so sometimes they split it

1451
00:50:56,995 --> 00:50:59,515
up yes so sometimes sometimes they'll only

1452
00:50:59,515 --> 00:51:01,675
do like the a part that row

1453
00:51:01,675 --> 00:51:02,665
right and then they'll come back the

1454
00:51:02,665 --> 00:51:03,805
next night and do the b part

1455
00:51:03,805 --> 00:51:05,431
or the the you know like sometimes

1456
00:51:05,455 --> 00:51:06,475
they mix em up different order

1457
00:51:06,595 --> 00:51:07,855
we saw it on a weekend i

1458
00:51:07,855 --> 00:51:09,325
think where there's a matinee so we

1459
00:51:09,475 --> 00:51:11,035
get to see both parts on the

1460
00:51:11,035 --> 00:51:14,455
same y'all dinner between with dinner said

1461
00:51:14,455 --> 00:51:17,785
saris oh what a broady guys we

1462
00:51:17,785 --> 00:51:19,165
have to go back to new york

1463
00:51:19,465 --> 00:51:23,635
we do think of everything hey also

1464
00:51:23,695 --> 00:51:24,655

1465
00:51:24,655 --> 00:51:26,128

1486
00:52:07,645 --> 00:52:10,255
oh man the ultimate indignity paying for

1487
00:52:10,255 --> 00:52:12,955
underwear it's it's mortify and it's just

1488
00:52:12,955 --> 00:52:14,515
saying that we only the government should

1489
00:52:14,515 --> 00:52:16,015
pay for to the pharmacy they have

1490
00:52:16,025 --> 00:52:18,415
in that glass case the government should

1491
00:52:18,415 --> 00:52:20,515
give you tampons and underwear for free

1492
00:52:21,205 --> 00:52:22,735
they actually should get less they want

1493
00:52:22,795 --> 00:52:24,265
to ship one thing that was not

1494
00:52:24,265 --> 00:52:26,485
one is ridiculous that that's not it's

1495
00:52:26,575 --> 00:52:28,045
well it's also crazy how expensive they

1496
00:52:28,045 --> 00:52:29,965
are yes not only should they be

1497
00:52:29,965 --> 00:52:31,045
free if they're not only free it

1498
00:52:31,045 --> 00:52:32,965
should cost no more than toilet paper

1499
00:52:32,965 --> 00:52:34,375
emily yeah it's i mean it's the

1500
00:52:34,375 --> 00:52:36,792
woman tax yeah it's fucked up yeah

1501
00:52:36,835 --> 00:52:39,625
really is anisha there's well it's just

1502
00:52:39,625 --> 00:52:41,335
that i like salon type places

1503
00:52:41,515 --> 00:52:44,065
okay should be free they have the

1504
00:52:44,095 --> 00:52:46,285
no there's no woman tax or whatever

1505
00:52:46,285 --> 00:52:47,335
like there's like a sticker in the

1506
00:52:47,335 --> 00:52:49,285
window what's that tickers i don't know

1507
00:52:49,435 --> 00:52:50,575
enough about it to really speak on

1508
00:52:50,575 --> 00:52:51,560
this but i think that there's when

1509
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:53,875
we talk about nfc non fungible token

1510
00:52:53,875 --> 00:52:54,805
i just learned about

1511
00:52:56,005 --> 00:53:00,355
so stupid yeah by digital art well

1512
00:53:00,385 --> 00:53:01,705
okay let me liken it to this

1513
00:53:01,705 --> 00:53:03,475
this is what i thought bitcoin was

1514
00:53:03,625 --> 00:53:05,395
well it's it's related to be going

1515
00:53:05,395 --> 00:53:08,545
where it's ah the reason they're bad

1516
00:53:08,545 --> 00:53:10,915
for the environment is that these computers

1517
00:53:11,125 --> 00:53:12,085
here it was bad for the environment

1518
00:53:12,085 --> 00:53:13,075
yes and if teas are bad for

1519
00:53:13,075 --> 00:53:14,785
the environment and the reason is is

1520
00:53:14,785 --> 00:53:16,135
because shane order to

1521
00:53:16,135 --> 00:53:19,585
authenticate them computer is cut down forty

1522
00:53:19,585 --> 00:53:20,185
trees

1523
00:53:21,535 --> 00:53:23,905
to make computers know these computers have

1524
00:53:23,905 --> 00:53:28,435
to constantly be solving these complex equations

1525
00:53:28,705 --> 00:53:31,075
which takes up so much processing power

1526
00:53:31,225 --> 00:53:33,205
that takes up so much energy the

1527
00:53:33,205 --> 00:53:35,515
energy to like make one bitcoin can

1528
00:53:35,605 --> 00:53:39,805
can ah power like a small town

1529
00:53:39,805 --> 00:53:41,575
for five years or something like this

1530
00:53:42,295 --> 00:53:43,855
yeah so it's ridiculous so anyways the

1531
00:53:43,855 --> 00:53:45,835
whole stupid but the end of teas

1532
00:53:45,835 --> 00:53:48,385
are like basically it's a way the

1533
00:53:48,385 --> 00:53:49,795
good part about it is is a

1534
00:53:49,795 --> 00:53:52,765
way for digital artists with no dumb

1535
00:53:52,765 --> 00:53:53,082
people

1536
00:53:54,685 --> 00:53:56,575
who's willing to pay for anything no

1537
00:53:56,575 --> 00:53:58,915
it's it allows like like the mona

1538
00:53:58,915 --> 00:54:02,695
lisa okay a print holding but i'm

1539
00:54:02,695 --> 00:54:04,555
likening it to a print the mona

1540
00:54:04,555 --> 00:54:06,745
lisa print the mona know it but

1541
00:54:06,745 --> 00:54:07,855
here's here's what i'm trying to say

1542
00:54:07,855 --> 00:54:10,465
the mona lisa the original is where

1543
00:54:10,465 --> 00:54:12,295
it is everyone knows that the louvre

1544
00:54:12,415 --> 00:54:14,095
but you can have i was pretending

1545
00:54:14,095 --> 00:54:14,455
to know

1546
00:54:14,875 --> 00:54:17,185
you can hire is that everyone knows

1547
00:54:18,685 --> 00:54:21,505
good gray i love that cover but

1548
00:54:21,505 --> 00:54:22,975
you can have a print of it

1549
00:54:23,245 --> 00:54:26,035
yeah and invite people over to your

1550
00:54:26,035 --> 00:54:27,655
house and no one thinks that you

1551
00:54:27,655 --> 00:54:29,365
have the real mona lisa and you're

1552
00:54:29,365 --> 00:54:30,715
very cool like this dude's got the

1553
00:54:30,715 --> 00:54:34,345
real mona lisa very cool but that's

1554
00:54:34,345 --> 00:54:36,085
what's cool but that's what nfs are

1555
00:54:36,085 --> 00:54:38,455
to digital art is you

1556
00:54:38,455 --> 00:54:41,455
yes anyone could make a a gif

1557
00:54:41,455 --> 00:54:43,225
or a or a you know jpeg

1558
00:54:43,225 --> 00:54:44,875
of someone's digital art and pass it

1559
00:54:44,875 --> 00:54:49,135
around the the owner or sometimes owners

1560
00:54:49,135 --> 00:54:50,995
because they split it up amongst people

1561
00:54:50,995 --> 00:54:52,645
of this digital art they're the ones

1562
00:54:52,825 --> 00:54:54,415
they're the ones who have the original

1563
00:54:54,415 --> 00:54:55,825
and they're the owners you know so

1564
00:54:55,825 --> 00:54:56,995
it's like me saying like oh i

1565
00:54:56,995 --> 00:54:58,375
own the mona lisa i'm a fucking

1566
00:54:58,375 --> 00:54:58,615
rich

1567
00:54:58,645 --> 00:55:01,315
weirdo you know i mean that's what

1568
00:55:01,315 --> 00:55:03,265
it's good for yeah because digital artists

1569
00:55:03,265 --> 00:55:06,835
their work is devalued um because anybody

1570
00:55:06,838 --> 00:55:08,185
can just anyone can just print up

1571
00:55:08,185 --> 00:55:09,385
a print go i own this thing

1572
00:55:09,445 --> 00:55:11,257
so but this is like a a

1573
00:55:11,343 --> 00:55:13,195
a physical print that you would hang

1574
00:55:13,195 --> 00:55:15,085
on the wall no it is just

1575
00:55:15,085 --> 00:55:16,735
exist on computer just can exist on

1576
00:55:16,735 --> 00:55:17,965
a computer you could do whatever you

1577
00:55:17,965 --> 00:55:18,775
want with it but you

1578
00:55:18,805 --> 00:55:21,085
are these certificate owner it's like having

1579
00:55:21,085 --> 00:55:23,695
it's very weird to put that on

1580
00:55:23,695 --> 00:55:25,825
your phone yeah it's out of money

1581
00:55:25,855 --> 00:55:28,345
it's having a certificate of authenticity for

1582
00:55:28,375 --> 00:55:30,565
anything that anyway i'm not i think

1583
00:55:30,565 --> 00:55:32,335
digital art is amazing but i think

1584
00:55:32,335 --> 00:55:34,225
that this is it by by just

1585
00:55:34,225 --> 00:55:35,965
by the fact that it moves but

1586
00:55:35,965 --> 00:55:37,855
they're trying to say that right they're

1587
00:55:37,866 --> 00:55:38,935
kind of going i'm not going

1588
00:55:38,935 --> 00:55:40,135
to sell this they're trying to say

1589
00:55:40,135 --> 00:55:41,455
that in the future we're all going

1590
00:55:41,455 --> 00:55:42,985
to have these like digital wallets on

1591
00:55:42,985 --> 00:55:44,545
our phone that anyone can check out

1592
00:55:44,545 --> 00:55:45,805
at any time in it's like when

1593
00:55:45,805 --> 00:55:46,975
you play a video game and you

1594
00:55:46,975 --> 00:55:49,855
buy an outfit for it so so

1595
00:55:49,855 --> 00:55:51,835
not fights pride in your ranking you're

1596
00:55:51,838 --> 00:55:53,305
like i want my wall i'm not

1597
00:55:53,335 --> 00:55:55,915
buying an outfit for some digital painting

1598
00:55:57,325 --> 00:55:58,885
to buy one though you would deny

1599
00:55:58,885 --> 00:56:01,315
miss the point you would you go

1600
00:56:01,315 --> 00:56:03,445
to saks fifth avenue and buying outfit

1601
00:56:03,445 --> 00:56:05,695
if you are so mean of course

1602
00:56:05,695 --> 00:56:07,465
i would they would it matched the

1603
00:56:07,465 --> 00:56:09,535
painting well i would hope so well

1604
00:56:09,655 --> 00:56:11,305
then you understand what i'm talking about

1605
00:56:11,335 --> 00:56:13,285
if sachs has retained any shred of

1606
00:56:13,285 --> 00:56:16,285
it's former equality lauren you are slouching

1607
00:56:16,285 --> 00:56:17,095
down hearing me

1608
00:56:17,125 --> 00:56:19,645
explain an f t's much like you're

1609
00:56:19,645 --> 00:56:22,195
talking about realities hey guy i'm i'm

1610
00:56:22,195 --> 00:56:23,845
interested in knowing about it i'm just

1611
00:56:23,845 --> 00:56:25,555
getting tired i'm just trying to explain

1612
00:56:25,585 --> 00:56:26,935
z but hey i think it's great

1613
00:56:26,965 --> 00:56:28,975
right you don't have to apologize but

1614
00:56:28,975 --> 00:56:31,135
peelers austin people are selling things like

1615
00:56:31,435 --> 00:56:33,445
hey i'm i'm selling you remember when

1616
00:56:33,445 --> 00:56:34,465
i was in your town and i

1617
00:56:34,465 --> 00:56:37,105
stage dived a band ice i did

1618
00:56:37,105 --> 00:56:37,154
a

1619
00:56:37,255 --> 00:56:39,685
stage dive event ah you know into

1620
00:56:39,685 --> 00:56:41,245
the audience you are the owner of

1621
00:56:41,245 --> 00:56:42,865
that stage dive yeah no i mean

1622
00:56:42,895 --> 00:56:44,425
i guess i guess the thing that's

1623
00:56:44,425 --> 00:56:46,435
so peter lerner is doing tweets and

1624
00:56:46,435 --> 00:56:48,955
all this because it feels like to

1625
00:56:48,955 --> 00:56:49,675
say

1626
00:56:51,385 --> 00:56:54,505
i own this it's it's own brand

1627
00:56:54,505 --> 00:56:55,885
what it feels like to me is

1628
00:56:55,885 --> 00:56:57,415
like having a rolex that you keep

1629
00:56:57,415 --> 00:56:58,855
in a safety deposit box you never

1630
00:56:58,855 --> 00:57:00,925
wear exactly or it's like having wash

1631
00:57:00,925 --> 00:57:02,755
and figures had never take out of

1632
00:57:02,755 --> 00:57:04,525
the box like it feels even that

1633
00:57:04,525 --> 00:57:06,055
makes more sense because you like having

1634
00:57:06,055 --> 00:57:08,755
a hundred dollars right in your wallet

1635
00:57:08,935 --> 00:57:10,375
paul and pies huh

1636
00:57:12,358 --> 00:57:14,785
pulse not getting like having breakfast lunch

1637
00:57:14,785 --> 00:57:15,955
and dinner every day

1638
00:57:17,935 --> 00:57:20,365
simultaneous things like the bare minimum it's

1639
00:57:20,365 --> 00:57:22,705
like having a roof oh my
