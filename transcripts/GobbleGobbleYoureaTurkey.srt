pi in the

411
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:33,218
yeah here's what i saw i saw

412
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:35,650
good movie it no it's not small

413
00:14:35,890 --> 00:14:37,900
lauren i'll fight you i've i've seen

414
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,580
the very beginning of i don't care

415
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:40,930
about actually fighting i've seen the very

416
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:42,640
beginning sally field where he's doing the

417
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,590
cartoon releasing the cartoon voices so insane

418
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:47,440
and so irrelevant the thing is already

419
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,680
animated and he's improvising relevant you can

420
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:52,030
do character this is your

421
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:53,470
jaw but you should know that you

422
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:54,880
can't do that it's okay it's not

423
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,050
irrelevant i just have to say that

424
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,010
because people are like it's not real

425
00:14:57,010 --> 00:14:57,940
because the whole point is that he

426
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:59,260
does a character the entire time so

427
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:00,010
that's why you need to know that

428
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:01,540
he does voices i get that yeah

429
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:02,560
but here's that to be bad at

430
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,530
it but sally field gives an amazing

431
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:07,090

um in the summer to the parker

706
00:24:55,605 --> 00:24:57,645
yeah in august because it was a

707
00:24:57,645 --> 00:24:59,325
thousand degrees and so they'd have these

708
00:24:59,325 --> 00:25:01,665
amazing deals and then they sort of

709
00:25:01,665 --> 00:25:05,025
realised oh people come anyway yeah let's

710
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:06,435
because back to the regular prices and

711
00:25:06,435 --> 00:25:08,025
then we stopped going that sucks yeah

712
00:25:08,125 --> 00:25:10,005
really does suck but it was great

713
00:25:10,035 --> 00:25:11,385
it was like a very felt like

714
00:25:11,385 --> 00:25:13,095
a very grown-up place yeah know what

715
00:25:13,095 --> 00:25:15,495
i mean and we would spend most

716
00:25:15,495 --> 00:25:17,595
of the time just as telling the

717
00:25:17,595 --> 00:25:19,815
hole and everything you guys feel like

718
00:25:19,815 --> 00:25:21,825
you're not grownups most of the time

719
00:25:21,855 --> 00:25:22,815
i sort of feel like that

720
00:25:24,015 --> 00:25:26,925
um yeah i guess emotionally yeah sometimes

721
00:25:26,985 --> 00:25:28,575
it catches me by it catches me

722
00:25:28,575 --> 00:25:30,585
off guard where like i'm still worried

723
00:25:30,585 --> 00:25:33,555
about that the fuck what's i thought

724
00:25:33,555 --> 00:25:36,285
i'd be past that yeah that's interesting

725
00:25:36,315 --> 00:25:37,935
but i guess just like mentally you

726
00:25:37,965 --> 00:25:39,405
think about yourself like i think i

727
00:25:39,405 --> 00:25:41,055
feel like it's sort of still a

728
00:25:41,055 --> 00:25:42,435
kid in a way i don't know

729
00:25:42,465 --> 00:25:43,755
i think i do i feel like

730
00:25:43,755 --> 00:25:44,085
i think

731
00:25:44,115 --> 00:25:48,315
myself as like in my thirties yeah

732
00:25:48,555 --> 00:25:49,515
young virile

733
00:25:50,595 --> 00:25:52,845
yeah i think i'm full of comey

734
00:25:52,845 --> 00:25:54,645
writing him in maybe a different point

735
00:25:54,645 --> 00:25:57,705

751
00:26:28,515 --> 00:26:30,645
because it's that thing and i feel

752
00:26:30,645 --> 00:26:30,855
like i've

753
00:26:30,893 --> 00:26:33,885
tried to describe in life where i

754
00:26:33,915 --> 00:26:35,595
like it where you sort about your

755
00:26:35,595 --> 00:26:37,575
as your own god i can't oh

756
00:26:37,575 --> 00:26:39,405
my god or is smart she said

757
00:26:39,405 --> 00:26:40,905
she was always like that little kitty

758
00:26:41,205 --> 00:26:42,585
she lied and then when you and

759
00:26:42,585 --> 00:26:43,395
then you and then you

760
00:26:45,735 --> 00:26:46,785
but i was thinking about how

761
00:26:47,925 --> 00:26:51,645
yeah my older relatives for type ooh

762
00:26:51,675 --> 00:26:53,835
we know throw towing you talk right

763
00:26:53,835 --> 00:26:55,982
now when you have to take one

764
00:26:56,413 --> 00:26:58,215
tibbs and you're like you sort of

765
00:26:58,215 --> 00:27:00,105
think that they know everything because they're

766
00:27:00,105 --> 00:27:01,875
like adults yes and then you grow

767
00:27:01,875 --> 00:27:03,315
up and you start to understand like

768
00:27:03,615 --> 00:27:06,015
they are r fifty for the first

769
00:27:06,015 --> 00:27:07,875
time in sixty for the first time

770
00:27:08,115 --> 00:27:10,065
it's not that they ever experienced anything

771
00:27:10,095 --> 00:27:11,865
any of this before just like i

772
00:27:11,865 --> 00:27:13,545
am figuring everything out and it's such

773
00:27:13,545 --> 00:27:15,075
a mind-blowing thing even though it's very

774
00:27:15,075 --> 00:27:17,355
obvious but i feel like i have

775
00:27:17,355 --> 00:27:19,725
that over and over about like everyone

776
00:27:19,725 --> 00:27:21,585
and like myself yeah that it's like

777
00:27:21,615 --> 00:27:23,715
oh i feel like i'm the only

778
00:27:23,715 --> 00:27:25,425
one who like doesn't know what's going

779
00:27:25,425 --> 00:27:27,075
on or something then you're like everyone

780
00:27:27,075 --> 00:27:28,155
doesn't know yeah

781
00:27:28,335 --> 00:27:30,975
yeah i think about todd classes joke

782
00:27:30,975 --> 00:27:32,481
about you know like you used to

783
00:27:32,481 --> 00:27:33,675
be when you when you were young

784
00:27:33,675 --> 00:27:34,905
and you were imitating someone who was

785
00:27:34,905 --> 00:27:36,915
fifty you'd be like yeah i'm fifty

786
00:27:36,915 --> 00:27:38,805

hi i'm fifty i'm in a band

789
00:27:42,015 --> 00:27:43,905

790
00:27:43,905 --> 00:27:45,645
because when we were young imitating people

791
00:27:45,645 --> 00:27:47,115
who were fifty people who are fifty

792
00:27:47,115 --> 00:27:48,285

00:27:48,405 --> 00:27:50,985
i smoked for fifty years wild hell

794
00:27:51,255 --> 00:27:54,045

816
00:28:36,435 --> 00:28:37,635
what we associate with old lady but

817
00:28:37,635 --> 00:28:38,535

00:37:50,725 --> 00:37:51,955
up to me and offered me opium

1101
00:37:52,255 --> 00:37:56,635
oh pokal pocket ah fuck it i

1102
00:37:56,635 --> 00:37:59,305
don't think anyone's ever offered me cocaine

1103
00:37:59,305 --> 00:38:01,195
but maybe they will miss square these

1104
00:38:01,255 --> 00:38:02,755
workbooks make it sound like every single

1105
00:38:02,755 --> 00:38:04,225
party you're going to go to was

1106
00:38:04,255 --> 00:38:05,965
like people trying to push cocaine on

1107
00:38:05,965 --> 00:38:07,675
you i wish people would try to

1108
00:38:07,675 --> 00:38:08,935
give me cocaine like every part

1109
00:38:09,048 --> 00:38:10,978

00:38:14,185 --> 00:38:15,535
to make it like a cool party

1113
00:38:15,535 --> 00:38:17,395
and actually that the the phrase the

1114
00:38:17,395 --> 00:38:19,765
term workbook sends a shiver down my

1115
00:38:19,765 --> 00:38:21,653
spine yeah because that meant what i

1116
00:38:21,653 --> 00:38:24,205
had news what if i assigned you

1117
00:38:24,205 --> 00:38:25,555
