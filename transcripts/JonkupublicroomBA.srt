day off so it must be exhausting

150
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:36,508
most people gotta be so the but

151
00:05:36,508 --> 00:05:38,280
even just putting on a jacket with

152
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,410
all the books and i figured here

153
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:40,994
sometimes i think

154
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:43,170
you have to spend all my money

155
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:43,890
on spirit gum

156
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:47,280
when fully my system when

157
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:51,626
in our culture typically senior citizens who

158
00:05:51,626 --> 00:05:52,950
have dentures sure

159
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:57,380
when does that become the thing where

160
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,760
like do you transfer into some ditch

161
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:04,410
do you crossover like you do then

162
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:06,090
pull all your teeth and just do

163
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:08,160
i'm like when does that because like

164
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,330
my grandma had interest but i wasn't

165
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:11,310
really aware of that right and then

166
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:13,290
they would just slip sometimes i never

167
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:14,460
saw them no no no it was

168
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:16,050
only when she would always be when

169
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:17,280
like i think near the end of

170
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,150
her life that i was aware that

171
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:19,260
she had dentures but it was like

172
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,060
i last thing she was

173
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:22,102
through

174
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:27,180
yeah there's for me by far really

175
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:28,350
think about it but i'm like i'm

176
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:30,120
sure many people who are ninety have

177
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:33,750
dentures but like my dad dentures when

178
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,580
did so what my question is when

179
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:36,750
do you go from regular t to

180
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:37,950
be like let's just call it and

181
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:39,000
just go to denver let's get em

182
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,800
all let's get em all out um

183
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,440
i don't know and i imagine it's

184
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:46,860
it's the amount of teeth that can

185
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:49,170
be preserved because he did not like

186
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:50,850
have a full set of dentures it

187
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:52,920
was like they fit in between other

188
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:54,630
yeah that already exists yeah well he

189
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:56,070
i think he had i think he

190
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:57,840
had back teeth but he didn't have

191
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,580
any more front teeth because they got

192
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:01,800
too weak or something yeah yeah that's

193
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,240
so sad because i think the teeth

194
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:03,600
can

195
00:07:03,841 --> 00:07:07,470
the infection can whatever can the rums

196
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:09,450
i don't believe in god is because

197
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:11,040
like if there was a god he

198
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,780
would make teeth last forever so why

199
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:13,800
are there why do we get rid

200
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,060
of baby teeth and then suddenly we

201
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,860
have adult it's like too confusing i'm

202
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:19,020
a little mad at you because i

203
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:20,130
asked you to let me guess why

204
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:21,600
you don't believe in god i'm so

205
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,760
sorry spoilers and we've been saying for

206
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,320
a year i felt like i was

207
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,850
really close to he was getting really

208
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:28,320
it was kind of twenty questions times

209
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,790
yeah well what did you narrow it

210
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:31,650
down to i narrowed it down to

211
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:34,230
why do we have nightmares but it

212
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:36,780
seems unfair it's we just sleep can

213
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:38,850
we have just like pleasant dreams yeah

214
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,800
we always say sweet dreams yes right

215
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,690
before bedtime to each other and the

216
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:46,230
platypus oh yeah the plot was like

217
00:07:46,230 --> 00:07:49,050
what's the point it's a weird combo

218
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:52,290
skills extinct it but it's not it

219
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:53,040
should be

220
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,680
b what's the deal with ants like

221
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:57,540
we don't need a question we don't

222
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,400
i think we do know we do

223
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:01,920
yeah here's humans don't i know but

224
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,920

this shit they're always like well we

226
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:07,650
need because they kill the other thing

227
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,350
let's exterminate them all and though it

228
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:12,450
looks not so neat for something to

229
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:13,170
kill the other

230
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,030
thing well yes i've long said we

happens with you um but basically i'm

408
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:48,750
going to be attaching these electrodes to

409
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:51,570
your legs and foot and then i'm

410
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:54,510
going to be sticking needles into your

411
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:56,912
feet and did he say writhing around

412
00:14:56,912 --> 00:14:58,080
on the floor in pain something to

413
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,910
that effect okay so you pictured at

414
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:01,380
least yeah yeah i'm going to be

415
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:02,820
sticking these these needles

416
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:04,770
into your foot and activating the nerves

417
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:07,410
um like their electric shocks and i

418
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:11,250
was like oh okay um k and

419
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:13,950
ah so i got this i see

420
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:15,000
your credentials please

421
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:17,584
you didn't look up what i'm doing

422
00:15:17,647 --> 00:15:21,150
so crazy poke yeah but when he's

423
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:23,037
new to zoom battery i suppose i'm

424
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,590
gonna jump your punk ass noodle so

425
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,300
so he put a bunch of noodles

426
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,860
in my veins

427
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,370
put the noodles in my veins i

428
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,270
went to the pasta

429
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:38,310
so he he started doing it and

430
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:40,860
thankfully i think because in physical therapy

431
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:42,420
one of the things they were doing

432
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:43,650
to try to cure this was wrapping

433
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:46,110
my leg up in this thing that

434
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:49,230
would ah give me electric shocks and

435
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:50,640
you would turn it up as far

436
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:51,840
as you could take so you can

437
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,790
lose weight in your foot yeah i'm

438
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:54,510
sort of remembering

439
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:57,210
one hundred fresh shade is fresh high

440
00:15:57,210 --> 00:15:58,920
this noodles in the vein

441
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:04,320
charlie yeah man i do fasciitis whatever

442
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:06,270
they would they did some electrode thing

443
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:08,040
on my feet right that would be

444
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,690
like something sound so you would turn

445
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:11,190
it they would say yeah this is

446
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:12,540
going to be fifteen minutes turned up

447
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:13,830
as high as you can in order

448
00:16:14,190 --> 00:16:15,360
where you can still take it for

449
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,950
fifteen minutes right so i would turn

450
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:18,390
up as high as good yes i

451
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:20,460
think because of that he's basically like

452
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:20,820
sticking the

453
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:21,900
the needle on my thing and making

454
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,880
my nerve go boop yeah and then

455
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,800
making a needle in your thing yeah

456
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:29,010
and that sound my needle that is

457
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:31,920
that too so you tell the difference

458
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:33,570
is that to see which nerve is

459
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:36,480
being activated the pain you're feeling also

460
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,540
he's he's he's sticking a needle in

461
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:40,980
it and and hearing like

462
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:42,990
like the the echoes in it and

463
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:45,600
stuff like maybe like ah like literally

464
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,480
he was like a dolphin it's like

465
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:50,520
connected to a computer with like these

466
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,350
sine waves and stuff and it's it's

467
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:57,150
like going oh huh and so that's

468
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:59,910
your foot noise yeah you so he's

469
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:01,110
trying to figure out which nerve

470
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:04,290
is the problem right and so he

471
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:07,170
does all this and he goes alright

472
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:08,880
well go back to your i'll send

473
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,590

yeah i think he was yeah he

477
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,640
wanted to be like oh dog

557
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,580
when it wore off so we found

put steroids in

563
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:12,150
do it and then it may go

564
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:13,740
away and if not then they block

565
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,600
the nerve which is like an operation

566
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:18,330

based on what they had always carry

812
00:27:49,525 --> 00:27:51,775

00:31:51,925 --> 00:31:53,905
from this i and i did but

924
00:31:53,905 --> 00:31:55,285
not i did everyone who worked there

925
00:31:55,285 --> 00:31:58,735
love hats no cam i definitely love

926
00:31:58,744 --> 00:32:00,235
that's more than anyone so how many

927
00:32:00,235 --> 00:32:02,725
hats did you take i took like

928
00:32:02,785 --> 00:32:05,065
half a dozen acts like a gesture

929
00:32:05,065 --> 00:32:06,265
like i would tell you not take

930
00:32:06,295 --> 00:32:07,705
just half a dozen sounds like more

931
00:32:07,705 --> 00:32:10,105
than six it just yeah twenty

932
00:32:10,105 --> 00:32:12,775
he hats half a dozen like just

933
00:32:12,775 --> 00:32:14,455
a phrase i know it's like when

934
00:32:14,455 --> 00:32:15,745
you say like a quarter of a

935
00:32:15,745 --> 00:32:17,635
million is like that's so what it's

936
00:32:17,635 --> 00:32:18,595
well it's a quarter of a lot

937
00:32:18,595 --> 00:32:20,245
of things my my god a million

938
00:32:20,245 --> 00:32:21,235
why are you saying half a dozen

939
00:32:21,235 --> 00:32:22,735
just say just say a handful because

940
00:32:22,735 --> 00:32:24,566
that size just say six no just

941
00:32:24,566 --> 00:32:26,215
say five because you probably why does

942
00:32:26,695 --> 00:32:27,745
why doesn't just say the number that

943
00:32:27,745 --> 00:32:29,485
actually took yeah why are you lying

944
00:32:29,485 --> 00:32:29,875
to us

945
00:32:31,105 --> 00:32:33,175
you're passing my test which is wonderful

946
00:32:35,815 --> 00:32:38,695
but then that store reopened and they

947
00:32:38,695 --> 00:32:40,615
didn't have an imam shaker hats back

948
00:32:40,615 --> 00:32:41,575
and you had to give him back

949
00:32:41,575 --> 00:32:43,285
paul paul paul you need to be

950
00:32:43,285 --> 00:32:45,175
here to see the bearcat hat we'd

951
00:32:45,175 --> 00:32:47,095
be joker just took six year old

952
00:32:47,125 --> 00:32:48,655
dances because you bought a twelve x

953
00:32:48,745 --> 00:32:50,155
yeah you stay and i was mad

954
00:32:50,155 --> 00:32:51,655
that they didn't come with beer yeah

955
00:32:51,865 --> 00:32:52,825
i was like oh shut the beer

956
00:32:52,825 --> 00:32:54,505
would half a dozen hats needs

957
00:32:54,535 --> 00:32:56,995
a dozen beers this is not math

958
00:32:56,995 --> 00:33:01,225
this mapping massive is a mathy um

959
00:33:01,435 --> 00:33:02,364
i thought it was a couple of

960
00:33:02,364 --> 00:33:04,975
years later the jungle boo bomb news

961
00:33:04,975 --> 00:33:08,665
updates and they did what they reopened

962
00:33:10,075 --> 00:33:12,415
and then eventually closed down again well

963
00:33:12,445 --> 00:33:14,245
as that's unfair but why don't we

964
00:33:14,245 --> 00:33:16,465
open it lasted a really long if

965
00:33:16,465 --> 00:33:17,755

967
00:33:19,255 --> 00:33:21,025
to close its twenty twenty four and

968
00:33:21,025 --> 00:33:23,455
people don't want hungary's yeah that's the

969
00:33:23,455 --> 00:33:24,925
thing no one wears hats anymore because

970
00:33:24,925 --> 00:33:26,695
our heads are warm from global warm

971
00:33:26,695 --> 00:33:28,825

973
00:33:30,067 --> 00:33:31,645
at all wait let me cover my

974
00:33:31,915 --> 00:33:32,455

00:33:35,094 --> 00:33:36,835
years you know like a little bit

977
00:33:37,165 --> 00:33:38,365
a little bit in your head it's

978
00:33:38,365 --> 00:33:40,405
like a different year june i mean

979
00:33:40,465 --> 00:33:43,135
no okay what do you mean i

980
00:33:43,135 --> 00:33:44,665
guess like if it's like seventeen seven

981
00:33:44,665 --> 00:33:47,035
like it's loosely twenty fourteen seventeen but

982
00:33:47,035 --> 00:33:49,015
like it's actually playing twenty four seventeen

983
00:33:49,285 --> 00:33:50,875
but i'm sort of like you know

984
00:33:50,875 --> 00:33:52,615
like how people are always like if

985
00:33:52,615 --> 00:33:53,545

1088
00:37:36,865 --> 00:37:39,175
men talk about other men's looks i

1089
00:37:39,175 --> 00:37:40,885
like damn man i'm talking about other

1090
00:37:40,885 --> 00:37:43,315
men's bodies like that we don't get

1091
00:37:43,315 --> 00:37:43,465
this

1092
00:37:43,615 --> 00:37:45,655
like us talking about okay now no

1093
00:37:45,685 --> 00:37:46,675
way talk to each other

1094
00:37:48,085 --> 00:37:50,125
hey paul i like your body

1095
00:37:51,175 --> 00:37:53,875

00:37:54,535 --> 00:37:56,335
casing around your soul i like the

1097
00:37:56,335 --> 00:37:58,885
contours of your frame wow

1098
00:38:00,685 --> 00:38:02,905
wow i'm enjoying this

1099
00:38:03,475 --> 00:38:08,335
ah it's fine because because it's it's

1100
00:38:08,335 --> 00:38:10,255
preferable to us talking about women's bodies

1101
00:38:10,255 --> 00:38:11,635
on the show it is probably can

1102
00:38:11,635 --> 00:38:13,495
we today i know are allowed

1103
00:38:16,567 --> 00:38:17,665
this brings me to a question i

1104
00:38:17,665 --> 00:38:19,705
was gonna rahm is bad is ah

1105
00:38:19,765 --> 00:38:19,945
um

1106
00:38:20,245 --> 00:38:22,705
yeah said i didn't get to hoi

1107
00:38:22,735 --> 00:38:23,545
yeah but i don't know if it

1108
00:38:23,545 --> 00:38:27,145
actually works both ways but so ah

1109
00:38:27,175 --> 00:38:28,585
you know a lot of times men

1110
00:38:28,675 --> 00:38:32,651
will date younger women sure and do

1111
00:38:32,725 --> 00:38:34,525
end so it's hard to i guess

1112
00:38:34,526 --> 00:38:36,505
i will say it's hard to date

1113
00:38:36,505 --> 00:38:38,005
someone who's the exact same age as

1114
00:38:38,005 --> 00:38:39,445
you why because it's just hard to

1115
00:38:39,445 --> 00:38:40,225
figure out that math

1116
00:38:40,405 --> 00:38:41,485
well i mean they have to be

1117
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:43,615
born on the birthday that you have

1118
00:38:43,645 --> 00:38:45,685
yeah that is very odd yards and

1119
00:38:45,702 --> 00:38:47,395
daytona is your exact same birthday it's

1120
00:38:47,395 --> 00:38:49,255

00:40:55,365 --> 00:40:57,795

00:40:57,915 --> 00:41:00,195
like here's here's what i bet huh

1186
00:41:00,285 --> 00:41:01,995
any woman that he's attracted to comes

1187
00:41:01,995 --> 00:41:03,465

he's like nobody he set up didn't

1191
00:41:08,535 --> 00:41:10,785
we were on september fifth so he

1192
00:41:10,815 --> 00:41:12,945
probably says that to everyone and ninety

1193
00:41:12,945 --> 00:41:14,235
nine percent go no and he goes

00:41:14,235 --> 00:41:15,555

who's my age where i'm like so

1203
00:41:34,515 --> 00:41:36,375

it's that really like and also like

1205
00:41:37,755 --> 00:41:40,545

1207
00:41:42,465 --> 00:41:43,873
made them now if you even come

00:41:43,873 --> 00:41:45,375
before that person if you would like

1209
00:41:45,375 --> 00:41:46,065
kind of meh

1210
00:41:46,065 --> 00:41:47,775
married now yes i think you i

1211
00:41:47,793 --> 00:41:49,395
think we've talked about this about a

1212
00:41:49,395 --> 00:41:51,558
specific person you've thought that about oh

1213
00:41:51,558 --> 00:41:52,725
well don't bring maybe not on this

1215
00:41:54,285 --> 00:41:55,455
ask you about that late al gore

1216
00:41:56,175 --> 00:41:58,665
but then the question is sad enough

1217
00:41:58,665 --> 00:42:00,225
it works the other way because it's

1218
00:42:00,225 --> 00:42:01,965
kind of gross either way but like

1219
00:42:01,965 --> 00:42:03,195
you know like you mentioned mary kate

1220
00:42:03,195 --> 00:42:05,055
and ashley they married people who were

1221
00:42:05,055 --> 00:42:06,225
older or one of

1222
00:42:06,225 --> 00:42:08,205
them did and then i'm like oh

1223
00:42:08,205 --> 00:42:09,435
well that happens the other way too

1224
00:42:09,435 --> 00:42:11,205
where it's like oh some like somebody

1225
00:42:11,235 --> 00:42:12,315
but then i guess it's gross i'm

1226
00:42:12,315 --> 00:42:14,085
asking it that way it's a good

1227
00:42:14,085 --> 00:42:15,765
