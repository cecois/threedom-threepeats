yeah i mean it's cool i'm i'm

31
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:22,860
not saying i did it exclusively i'm

32
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:24,000
saying when it doesn't seem

33
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:25,950
to be a thing everyone who ever

34
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:27,720
did that loose know i flip this

35
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,429
over this hourglass then you flipped it

36
00:01:29,429 --> 00:01:30,900
back and i wanna know why well

37
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:32,160
i thought that we would flip it

38
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,570
in order to time how we were

39
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:35,307
doing in the episode but i suddenly

40
00:01:35,307 --> 00:01:37,200
afflicted too early so i was like

41
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,910
you know it's like five minutes and

42
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:41,280
they will yeah so every five minutes

43
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,240
flip back and then at the end

44
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,410
will know how many five minutes ago

45
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:44,130
yeah that makes

46
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:45,180
thank you

47
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:48,720
you know it's definitely an hour i'd

48
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,030
say are these are these inherently an

49
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:51,390
hour

50
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:55,020
it depends on how much sounding sanders

51
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,030
extrinsically yeah

52
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,830
that one looks like an hour to

53
00:01:59,160 --> 00:01:59,910
there looks like

54
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:04,410
feels like smells like sounds

55
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:09,330
i think there are hourglass size that

56
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,520
are a day and there are some

57
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,480
that i'm in today

58
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,120
don't you think would that be from

59
00:02:15,122 --> 00:02:16,320
the ones from the board games for

60
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,070
a minute dude

61
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:21,210
so you'll be ooh i'm like glass

62
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:22,410
there's to be an arc she tugs

63
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:24,510
at the twenty four times that there's

64
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:25,470
to be an hour bus it's just

65
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:27,240
one grain of sand but it's on

66
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,160
a time release thing where after an

67
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,440
hour the the platform that it's just

68
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,360
drops out and it just one was

69
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,860

far or maybe two have you ever

136
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,750
done a trustful they fall into a

137
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,880
shopping cart and it hurts and then

138
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,410
they're on supermarket sweep and leslie jones

139
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:15,030

140
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:16,710
they can't because she doesn't show pushes

141
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:17,520
everyone know

142
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:20,730
wait have you guys ever when i've

143
00:05:20,731 --> 00:05:21,630
where i just asked

144
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,740
ah look i need you guys to

145
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:26,940
keep track of what i'm saying because

146
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:27,810
i do it

147
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,840
have you ever done a trust fall

148
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:32,430
oh and no i'm not going to

149
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:34,170
suggest we do one i think we're

150
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:35,520
never doing i would never try that

151
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,900
seems like something that you do when

152
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,850
you're in elementary we didn't high school

153
00:05:38,850 --> 00:05:39,810
we had a stand up on this

154
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:43,260
like really toll storage thing that was

155
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:46,767
like normally for five feet tall and

156
00:05:46,767 --> 00:05:48,040
stand up on it and then everyone

157
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,200
would put their hands interlock

158
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,779
looking like in two rows yeah it

159
00:05:51,779 --> 00:05:54,690
seems any more trustful back i know

160
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:56,040
it seems to danger that was my

161
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,900
class called adventure ed and we were

162
00:05:58,363 --> 00:05:59,730
we had a wall like a rock

163
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:01,500
climbing wall my school and you could

164
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,970
climb you'd climb the wall which was

165
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:05,010
really scary and then we wanna know

166
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:06,420
each other and just something yeah it

167
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:08,220
was all like okay i'm belay play

168
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:09,330

169
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:10,620

170
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:13,770

171
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:15,480

172
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,788
was a like ah what do you

173
00:06:17,788 --> 00:06:19,560

174
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:21,180
heaven

175
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:24,120
the solar system

176
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:28,860
very much over that pluto there was

177
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,360
a very old museum this was my

178
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,448
adventure and class was and were you

179
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,440
but did you say adventure ed yes

180
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:37,050
there's a very tall gymnasium and i

181
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:39,990
suppose everybody got a trophy it's is

182
00:06:40,033 --> 00:06:41,310

00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:44,040
there's a very tall gene all young

184
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:46,500
leo like a rock climbing class then

185
00:06:46,503 --> 00:06:48,090
you would do these trust exercises because

186
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:49,230
it was part of getting used to

187
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:50,430
like climbing on the wall sounds like

188

you put them in and they cry

585
00:20:35,445 --> 00:20:36,915
then you go into script and then

586
00:20:36,915 --> 00:20:37,764
you leave and then you come back

587
00:20:37,764 --> 00:20:38,895
and say you have to say so

588
00:20:38,895 --> 00:20:40,515
like you're kind of script like saying

589
00:20:40,515 --> 00:20:42,315

590
00:20:42,315 --> 00:20:44,248

i remember that show but what route

681
00:23:40,275 --> 00:23:42,855
how did they make nerds day hot

682
00:23:42,885 --> 00:23:45,225

or some bullshit or then do the

686
00:23:49,815 --> 00:23:51,822
challenges and all sorts of stuff because

687
00:23:51,822 --> 00:23:53,505
that's how many actually stay together though

688
00:23:53,745 --> 00:23:56,261
none have aller au yeah i started

689
00:23:56,261 --> 00:23:56,535
dealing

690
00:23:56,565 --> 00:23:59,919
earnest hots with nerds it's unbelievable it's

691
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:02,175
star crossed lovers and have good tv

692
00:24:02,175 --> 00:24:03,885
man where any of the nerds like

693
00:24:04,155 --> 00:24:06,105
i just didn't like the huts of

694
00:24:06,105 --> 00:24:07,665
course you know that's the force that's

695
00:24:07,665 --> 00:24:09,825
true because sometimes hot people are so

696
00:24:09,825 --> 00:24:11,835
stupid and fucking annoying i know but

697
00:24:11,835 --> 00:24:13,425
you overlook that because you want sex

hating the tension so much of the

1021
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,370
situation that she was like let's just

1022
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,530
acknowledge that it's bad and that way

1023
00:35:54,530 --> 00:35:55,689
we can all just i would respect

1024
00:35:55,706 --> 00:35:56,600
more if she was like look i

1025
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,100

1108
00:38:38,510 --> 00:38:40,700
and i touched both switches at the

1109
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:43,370
same time yeah and completed the circuit

1110
00:38:43,370 --> 00:38:47,120
between oh no what was it like

1111
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:49,190

00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:06,290
same school but i don't think i

1203
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:11,960

1204
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:13,490
who did that at different schools like

1205
00:42:13,970 --> 00:42:15,230

1206
00:42:15,230 --> 00:42:16,640

maybe damaged the friendship yeah yeah oh

guys oh good we're joking about but

1419
00:49:02,090 --> 00:49:03,980
no this is not a bad idea

1420
00:49:03,980 --> 00:49:05,630
for a television show you put a

1421
00:49:05,630 --> 00:49:05,750
law

1422
00:49:05,750 --> 00:49:07,490

long it's going to be it turns

1429
00:49:19,550 --> 00:49:21,320
out it's a week so to me

1430
00:49:21,350 --> 00:49:23,060
it could be like opening three hundred

1431
00:49:23,090 --> 00:49:25,250
no amount of changes based on how

1432
00:49:25,250 --> 00:49:25,910
you perform

1433
00:49:25,910 --> 00:49:26,810
i'm in the games that you don't

1434
00:49:26,810 --> 00:49:28,400
realize you're playing okay so you can

1435
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:29,480

1436
00:49:29,510 --> 00:49:31,640
earlier if you if you do everything

1437
00:49:31,910 --> 00:49:33,620

00:49:33,620 --> 00:49:35,000
for show this is a really good

1439
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,830

1468
00:50:33,650 --> 00:50:36,320
in the second season they always fought

1469
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:38,420
and they kicked out people in it

1470
00:50:38,450 --> 00:50:40,220
they're exactly the same and having the

1471
00:50:40,220 --> 00:50:42,380
same argument damage it's likely you can

1472
00:50:42,380 --> 00:50:44,000
go by that though i think people

1473
00:50:44,030 --> 00:50:45,260
i think people can change if they

1474
00:50:45,260 --> 00:50:46,550
want to change but did you think

1475
00:50:47,250 --> 00:50:48,750
and you yelled at twenty years ago

1476
00:50:48,750 --> 00:50:49,680
you'd still want to yell at them

1477
00:50:49,830 --> 00:50:51,663
oh yeah you know like i know

1478
00:50:51,663 --> 00:50:53,040
like people say i didn't get along

1479
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:55,170
with like that i'm like i say

1480
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:56,850
i don't think i'd still act the

1481
00:50:56,850 --> 00:50:57,810
way i did but i would still

1482
00:50:57,810 --> 00:50:59,040
probably like why i don't think i'm

1483
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:00,480
gonna get along with them right now

1484
00:51:00,510 --> 00:51:02,430
right i mean i'd be nice but

1485
00:51:02,430 --> 00:51:03,990
i'm saying it's like yeah you wouldn't

1486
00:51:04,020 --> 00:51:05,370
want to strike me a friendship so

1487
00:51:05,370 --> 00:51:06,746
mean to me it's the thing though

1488
00:51:06,746 --> 00:51:07,410
i would thing

1489
00:51:07,410 --> 00:51:09,420
if that if we did this show

1490
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:11,700
together which we should just show that

1491
00:51:11,700 --> 00:51:13,410
we're doing know the show show where

1492
00:51:13,410 --> 00:51:15,180
we know the show where we live

1493
00:51:15,180 --> 00:51:17,670
with her oh wait we're doing yes

1494
00:51:17,670 --> 00:51:19,770
we're all doing really well finally i

1495
00:51:19,770 --> 00:51:21,780
thought it was other people producing here

1496
00:51:21,780 --> 00:51:23,040
for winter mean we have to get

1497
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:24,390
to this because what i'm trying what

1498
00:51:24,390 --> 00:51:25,740
i'm trying to say is we've barely

1499
00:51:25,740 --> 00:51:27,330
spent time on yours lauren i know

1500
00:51:27,390 --> 00:51:27,570
what i'm

1501
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:28,710
trying to say is is that i

1502
00:51:28,710 --> 00:51:30,600
think the stakes would be lower because

1503
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:31,830
when you live with someone when you're

1504
00:51:31,980 --> 00:51:33,990
eighteen or twenty or whatever it's like

1505
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:36,870
everything is so important and like what's

1506
00:51:37,290 --> 00:51:38,400
it feels like the stakes would be

1507
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:39,480
lower but then i watched the real

1508
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:41,820
world thing and everyone is fighting immediately

1509
00:51:41,820 --> 00:51:45,120
and so it's like this major tv

1510
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:47,250
the same rally and it was like

1511
00:51:47,460 --> 00:51:47,730
they

1512
00:51:47,730 --> 00:51:49,740
they were on tv together and they

1513
00:51:49,770 --> 00:51:51,870
had a lot of their life most

1514
00:51:51,870 --> 00:51:53,430
of these people are raised because they

1515
00:51:53,430 --> 00:51:55,470
were on that show together yeah exactly

1516
00:51:55,740 --> 00:51:56,849
there they were put on tv at

1517
00:51:56,849 --> 00:51:58,590

1518
00:51:58,590 --> 00:52:01,110

didn't know what the time that you

1590
00:54:21,810 --> 00:54:23,280
could buy just like a cheap bed

1591
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:24,960
or whatever like that so the only

1592
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:26,610
bed i had was the bed that

1593
00:54:26,610 --> 00:54:27,600
i was sleeping on at the time

1594
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:29,310
which was a big sofa bed pull

1595
00:54:29,310 --> 00:54:31,650
out which is incredibly heavy and yeah

1596
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:32,370
and so at lee

1597
00:54:32,370 --> 00:54:35,340
east it's super comfortable it's terrible so

1598
00:54:35,340 --> 00:54:36,840
and it wasn't comfortable and so we

1599
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:38,370
put it in my room and then

1600
00:54:38,700 --> 00:54:41,460
attending anyway so uptick and wide when

1601
00:54:41,460 --> 00:54:42,840
you put it out it filled up

1602
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:44,490
the entire room so i was like

1603
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:47,190
so i just ended up sleeping on

1604
00:54:47,190 --> 00:54:49,020
the couch in the living room you

1605
00:54:49,050 --> 00:54:50,010
can just fold up your own thing

1606
00:54:50,010 --> 00:54:51,060
into a couch to sleep on it

1607
00:54:51,210 --> 00:54:53,490

1608
00:54:53,490 --> 00:54:55,350

for a week huh

1653
00:56:29,100 --> 00:56:29,640

1654
00:56:30,780 --> 00:56:32,100
if i had to die

1662
00:56:50,850 --> 00:56:52,110

a shared space with her for a

1672
00:57:04,950 --> 00:57:06,990
week i'm sure as big as the

place that you originally lived all that

1674
00:57:09,150 --> 00:57:11,880

by adam basilica boop editors called wedding

1738
00:59:20,790 --> 00:59:23,670
planners one player approaches the other two

1739
00:59:23,700 --> 00:59:26,814
who are competing wedding planners we're not

1740
00:59:26,820 --> 00:59:28,320
gonna approach each other we're sitting here

1741
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:32,640
approach though big mistake and yeah actually

1742
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:35,040
approach the first player tells them both

1743
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:36,450
the theme of their web

1744
00:59:36,450 --> 00:59:37,920
thing and the other two take turns

1745
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:40,500
pitching on theme ideas example if it's

1746
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:42,090
a pirate themed wedding the bride and

1747
00:59:42,090 --> 00:59:44,610
groom have to walk the plank great

1748
00:59:44,970 --> 00:59:47,100
that's great alright and then and then

1749
00:59:47,100 --> 00:59:48,990
the person picks which one they like

1750
00:59:49,080 --> 00:59:49,590
i guess

1751
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:53,520
whatever okay let's do it like for

1752
00:59:53,670 --> 00:59:55,800
somebody like like like wedding plans so

1753
00:59:55,804 --> 00:59:56,700
they don't pick the one they like

1754
00:59:56,700 --> 00:59:58,650
we we have to the wedding planners

1755
00:59:58,650 --> 01:00:00,690
have to take turns i just wonder

1756
01:00:00,690 --> 01:00:02,970
why it's competing with wedding planners if

1757
01:00:03,030 --> 01:00:04,200
there's not going to be the result

1758
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:05,820
of a competition well for sure good

1759
01:00:05,820 --> 01:00:08,130
someone says i pick you game over

1760
01:00:08,190 --> 01:00:10,620
yeah game over man yeah

1761
01:00:11,220 --> 01:00:13,567
okay i'll be the customer okay whoa

1762
01:00:13,590 --> 01:00:15,089
wait i'll be the i'm should it

1763
01:00:15,089 --> 01:00:16,650
just be a team of wedding planners

1764
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:18,720
and then we we pitch ideas rather

1765
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:20,280
than okay we could do need to

1766
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:22,170
be a competition three cheers don't need

1767
01:00:22,170 --> 01:00:23,910
to be a competition actually yeah that

1768
01:00:23,910 --> 01:00:24,840
is one of the main roles of

1769
01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:26,280
teachers they don't need to be competent

1770
01:00:26,280 --> 01:00:28,410
we would need someone to suggest a

1771
01:00:28,410 --> 01:00:30,390
theme unless one of us just suggested

1772
01:00:30,390 --> 01:00:30,780

now he's known skechers so the thoughtful

1882
01:04:17,685 --> 01:04:20,055
to have the dad cps the hologram

01:04:20,055 --> 01:04:21,615
of yeah you're gonna bring someone back

1884
01:04:21,615 --> 01:04:22,635
to life with the dead and this

1885
01:04:22,635 --> 01:04:23,385
is what i'm talking about

1886
01:04:23,745 --> 01:04:27,345
so the hologram robert duffy any tokay

1887
01:04:27,375 --> 01:04:30,075
if you pc that's right and the

1888
01:04:30,075 --> 01:04:32,145
site quote unquote make pcs

1889
01:04:33,315 --> 01:04:36,211
oh thank you okay so robert cardassian

1890
01:04:36,255 --> 01:04:37,995
what's the setting though because the setting

1891
01:04:37,995 --> 01:04:41,235
behind him is yes levels of an

1892
01:04:41,265 --> 01:04:44,235
old boat yeah with troughs of hay

1893
01:04:44,265 --> 01:04:46,125
yeah on every level and every human

1894
01:04:46,155 --> 01:04:49,485
eats out of the troughs exactly so

1895
01:04:49,515 --> 01:04:51,525
you basically push everyone's face into them

1896
01:04:51,525 --> 01:04:53,295
and say whatever isn't there some of

1897
01:04:53,295 --> 01:04:53,385
them

1898
01:04:53,415 --> 01:04:55,905
have animal poop in them okay because

1899
01:04:55,905 --> 01:04:57,585
animals don't know what they're doing right

1900
01:04:57,585 --> 01:04:59,565
okay so horse backup to a trough

1901
01:04:59,565 --> 01:05:00,675
and let a big shit drop in

1902
01:05:00,675 --> 01:05:02,145
it so it's just kinda general like

1903
01:05:02,175 --> 01:05:03,315
oh i was gonna eat that just

1904
01:05:03,345 --> 01:05:05,085
wow my little grains i was going

1905
01:05:05,085 --> 01:05:06,375
to eat just the wedding party get

1906
01:05:06,375 --> 01:05:07,875
it's own trough or it's just luck

1907
01:05:07,875 --> 01:05:09,135
of the draw if you get no

1908
01:05:09,135 --> 01:05:10,485
if you want the season the troops

1909
01:05:10,491 --> 01:05:11,265
up to you if you want the

1910
01:05:11,265 --> 01:05:12,345
wedding party get their own trough they

1911
01:05:12,345 --> 01:05:13,485
get a feces free trial

1912
01:05:13,875 --> 01:05:15,015
and no one will put your face

1913
01:05:15,015 --> 01:05:17,803
into and what's great about this is

1914
01:05:17,803 --> 01:05:20,085
it goes from the wedding to the

1915
01:05:20,085 --> 01:05:23,205
reception immediately you got a burner well

1916
01:05:23,205 --> 01:05:24,915
because the troughs are right behind you

1917
01:05:25,005 --> 01:05:26,565
and it's abode it's not that big

1918
01:05:26,685 --> 01:05:28,605

1919
01:05:28,605 --> 01:05:30,555

01:06:12,315 --> 01:06:14,025
it's flat it's very truman show

1948
01:06:14,025 --> 01:06:16,035
oh ask it's just a flat front

1949
01:06:16,035 --> 01:06:17,265
of an arc it's gonna look three

1950
01:06:17,265 --> 01:06:18,345
d when you look through the windows

1951
01:06:18,345 --> 01:06:19,215
of it it's gonna look like it

1952
01:06:19,215 --> 01:06:21,105
continues to hook it doesn't at all

1953
01:06:21,315 --> 01:06:22,845
so this isn't really even a boat

1954
01:06:22,875 --> 01:06:24,195
it's i'm going to have your family

1955
01:06:24,195 --> 01:06:26,415
hanging on with handles behind each window

1956
01:06:26,415 --> 01:06:28,065
to look through on the boat okay

1957
01:06:28,065 --> 01:06:29,745
i'm gonna say relax look like you're

1958
01:06:29,745 --> 01:06:31,483
standing on something but they're going to

1959
01:06:31,483 --> 01:06:33,015
be hanging with their arms they don't

1960
01:06:33,015 --> 01:06:34,185

1961
01:06:34,185 --> 01:06:35,895
how is it possible for me i

1962
01:06:35,895 --> 01:06:38,565

1963
01:06:38,685 --> 01:06:41,025
they're not franky says fans at all

1964
01:06:41,175 --> 01:06:43,573
frankie unfortunately does not say relax yes

1965
01:06:43,573 --> 01:06:45,495

1966
01:06:45,495 --> 01:06:47,235
