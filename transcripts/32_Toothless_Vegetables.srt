52
00:02:17,279 --> 00:02:20,340

54
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:24,990
we are living situation i've talked about

55
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:26,880
my original living situation where i slept

56
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,900
on the couch instead of in my

57
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:30,060
bed yes um and then i was

58
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:31,770
alone for a while and then for

59
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:33,000
the second half of the year i

60
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,840
moved in with

61
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,380
with one of my classmates um and

62
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:40,650
his roommate was bagel who had moved

63
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:42,660
up to it's a person that's hurt

64
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:44,280
it was his nickname i guess i

65
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,780
just gotta nail this down because a

66
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:48,120
person one time a guy named pockets

67
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,387

70
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:57,390
now your bagel guy big finish so

71
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:59,940
so bagels moved all the way out

72
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:02,400
to the middle of nowhere just because

73
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,380
he was good friends with my roommate

74
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:07,890

75
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:10,320

friend bagel moved all the way out

80

that same building i had there was

243
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:10,230
a unit over my house and it

244
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:13,050
was these three young women they were

245
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:13,680
in there too

246
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,449

yeah i've never gone in there yeah

251
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,550
it's so it's so weird that there's

252
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:30,900
that one store and it's been there

253
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,520

254
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:33,780
group didn't check down

00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:36,150
they put an ice cream know that

256
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:38,100
was a different place oh okay yeah

257
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:39,300
that was a different place i think

258
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,170
and um so they they were they

259
00:09:43,176 --> 00:09:44,880
were like these young women that were

260
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,100
like in the prime of their life

261
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:48,570
that were going out having fun time

262
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:51,840
they almost exclusively wore eye ills and

263
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:54,000
they had obviously no carpeting to speak

264
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:56,850
oh my guy here then walking around

265
00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:58,560
all the time but there was something

266
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,050
that was weirdly reassuring to me about

267
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:02,490
it because i was like i was

268
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:05,280
about to enter my forties and i

269
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:07,170
thought this was so like i just

270
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:08,850

271
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:10,890
them going they were yeah oh my

272
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:13,290

273
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:14,160
me otherwise that way

274
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,190
yeah and just hearing you used to

275
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:17,870

00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:56,797
what was his style enough grunts die

418
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:57,586
because i was trying to figure out

419
00:14:57,586 --> 00:15:00,039
if he was with somebody um but

420
00:15:00,039 --> 00:15:01,880
yeah you know i like to eavesdrop

421
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:02,510
yeah

422
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:05,780
did you ever try the thing of

423
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:08,090
putting a glass of guy hat yeah

424
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:11,060
yeah i haven't noticed any significant difference

425
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:13,880
but i've never been sure which way

426
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,320
your stats are part of glass and

427
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:18,050
i've tried both always little little ah

428
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,450
closed-end to your ear that's what i

429
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:22,040
thought yeah but i tried it both

430
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,390
ways it didn't really make a difference

431
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:24,980
yeah i think i was able to

432
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:27,590
hear who you're listening to my brother

433
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:30,013
i think i loved spying i was

434
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:32,030
little yeah would you be a professional

435
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:34,820
spy if you could um know but

436
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,160
what was i just okay i was

437
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:39,980
just watching oh citizen rose that rose

438
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:42,770
mcgowan thing oh yeah they showed like

439
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:43,997
the first episode but they're gonna

440
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:45,470
show the rest in the spring and

441
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:48,380
um she had a spy following her

442
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:50,510
oh yeah and it was a woman

443
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:52,190
whose job was to spot i mean

444
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:53,900
i find it fascinating she's a fake

445
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:55,250
has a fake name and then sits

446
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:57,772
behind somebody and just fucks with shit

447
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,170
like gathered dirt on gather dirt and

448
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:02,390
i think she had something to do

449
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:04,130
with um there was

450
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:06,680
a claim that rose had left something

451
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:08,480
behind on the airplane that had narcotics

452
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,300
with it but it was planted ah

453
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:13,880
now this is just like harvey weinstein

454
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,800
yeah there's this person and he hired

455
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,080
someone to to steal her book before

456
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,150
it was published and they got a

457
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:21,770
copy they got to make sure that

458
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:23,810
he was i don't know why he

459
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:24,350
would do

460
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:25,190
with it but i think would be

461
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:26,870
fun to be a spy although from

462
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:27,950
everything i've heard it's just like a

463
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:30,080
lot of waiting outside somewhere i think

464
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:32,270
the part that would suck if if

465
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:33,740
you had to be like have a

466
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:35,990
fake identity and like pretend to get

467
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:38,120
to know someone i'd feel bad right

468
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:39,710
the part i don't probably fall in

469
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:40,730
love with them and then there'd be

470
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:42,170
a big argument after we fell in

471
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:44,273
love yeah like google lies

472
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:46,940
may tell you is because oh actually

473
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:48,380
i'm actually mixing up two stories about

474
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:50,090
rose i don't know if where the

475
00:16:50,090 --> 00:16:51,650
spy was but there was one point

476
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:53,240
where she was spending time with the

477
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,260
spy like hanging out with her and

478
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:56,510

i don't like that yeah i don't

481
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:02,570
like it i there's a thing that

482
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:04,670
drives me crazy on cop shows where

483
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:05,990

690
00:24:24,205 --> 00:24:25,225
okay i didn't just get of one

691
00:24:25,255 --> 00:24:28,315
would you oh yeah wait what is

692
00:24:28,345 --> 00:24:30,265
what is if you had to go

693
00:24:30,265 --> 00:24:30,745
to prison

694
00:24:32,755 --> 00:24:34,075
um what would you have done with

695
00:24:34,105 --> 00:24:34,525
oil cost

696
00:24:35,605 --> 00:24:37,825
what's what's the what like what amount

697
00:24:37,825 --> 00:24:40,555
of time mentally would you be able

698
00:24:40,555 --> 00:24:42,205
to say like i can handle this

699
00:24:42,595 --> 00:24:43,975
this is this is gonna be i

700
00:24:43,975 --> 00:24:45,775
mean it will probably be like what's

701
00:24:45,775 --> 00:24:47,725
the maximum amount of time yeah like

702
00:24:47,725 --> 00:24:49,075
where we're at what point do you

703
00:24:49,075 --> 00:24:51,295
think you'd be like i just can't

704
00:24:51,295 --> 00:24:53,245
do this i think i could handle

705
00:24:53,245 --> 00:24:54,145
two months

706
00:24:55,285 --> 00:24:56,965
and then i'd probably start to really

707
00:24:58,225 --> 00:25:00,805
because two months worried yeah

708
00:25:02,005 --> 00:25:03,625
two minds like i could do i'm

709
00:25:03,625 --> 00:25:04,975
sure i could do longer i think

710
00:25:04,975 --> 00:25:06,865
you mentally your brain just adapts to

711
00:25:06,865 --> 00:25:07,885
think two months is like doing a

712
00:25:07,885 --> 00:25:09,205
stint in the big brother house or

713
00:25:09,205 --> 00:25:11,815
something but months can feel really long

714
00:25:11,875 --> 00:25:12,895
i don't know if you're i mean

715
00:25:12,895 --> 00:25:14,815
especially if you're in jail where especially

716
00:25:14,905 --> 00:25:16,705
go especially if you're doing january why

717
00:25:16,705 --> 00:25:19,315
does your face oh like for maybe

718
00:25:19,345 --> 00:25:22,135
fifteen minutes long

719
00:25:22,345 --> 00:25:24,325
i don't know i'm saying realistically you've

720
00:25:24,325 --> 00:25:26,755
done something wrong and we caught you

721
00:25:26,755 --> 00:25:28,015
for your thing yeah i'd have a

722
00:25:28,015 --> 00:25:30,595
hard time okay but how long because

723
00:25:30,655 --> 00:25:32,815
here's the thing you really go before

724
00:25:32,815 --> 00:25:34,705
you are like me where you're here

725
00:25:34,735 --> 00:25:37,015
if you're talking about just confinement i

726
00:25:37,015 --> 00:25:39,055
could do that easily i think not

727
00:25:39,055 --> 00:25:41,395
some more easily but if you're talking

728
00:25:41,395 --> 00:25:42,295
about everything

729
00:25:42,325 --> 00:25:45,655
thing that being imprisoned in tales there's

730
00:25:45,655 --> 00:25:46,735
a lot of stuff that i think

731
00:25:46,735 --> 00:25:47,905
i would have i'm very okay would

732
00:25:47,907 --> 00:25:49,645
get my ass kicked i have you

733
00:25:49,645 --> 00:25:51,205
watched a lot of like lockup raw

734
00:25:51,205 --> 00:25:53,395
or and like when msnbc at night

735
00:25:53,395 --> 00:25:55,465
on the weekends yeah i'm fine

736
00:25:56,515 --> 00:25:58,555
over his channel i like to love

737
00:25:58,555 --> 00:26:00,625
that show it's pretty good but like

738
00:26:00,625 --> 00:26:02,545

772
00:27:04,615 --> 00:27:06,235
older dude who just keeps to himself

773
00:27:06,235 --> 00:27:08,095
and plays chess with the pigeons or

774
00:27:08,095 --> 00:27:09,535
whatever like couldn't you be one of

775
00:27:09,535 --> 00:27:11,335
those or whatever like yeah like when

776
00:27:11,335 --> 00:27:12,685
after you more like fall in love

777
00:27:12,685 --> 00:27:13,945
with someone so it's not bad when

778
00:27:13,945 --> 00:27:15,955
you hook up no but i mean

779
00:27:15,985 --> 00:27:17,125
you know what i mean i am

780
00:27:17,125 --> 00:27:18,985
a romantic yeah it's like it seems

781
00:27:18,985 --> 00:27:20,305
like all the bad stuff that happens

782
00:27:20,305 --> 00:27:21,895
in prison on those shows and everything

783
00:27:21,895 --> 00:27:23,605
it happens it happens your first ten

784
00:27:23,605 --> 00:27:25,585
years and then after a while you

785
00:27:25,585 --> 00:27:28,074
just get used to it i you

786
00:27:28,074 --> 00:27:29,485
don't be the scariest thing i think

787
00:27:29,485 --> 00:27:32,245
is being locked up abroad that oh

788
00:27:32,365 --> 00:27:33,715
yeah and then you're in a jail

789
00:27:33,715 --> 00:27:35,455
where you don't speak the language and

790
00:27:35,455 --> 00:27:38,035
the rules don't really matter even like

791
00:27:38,035 --> 00:27:41,095
their regular yeah yeah though there everyone

792
00:27:41,095 --> 00:27:41,952
just is it's

793
00:27:42,055 --> 00:27:43,735
awful conditions right now i'd be so

794
00:27:44,245 --> 00:27:45,865
do you want to experience it though

795
00:27:45,865 --> 00:27:48,145
at some point oh what talking about

796
00:27:49,075 --> 00:27:50,305
i mean there are those shows where

797
00:27:50,305 --> 00:27:52,225
you can voluntarily go to jail there's

798
00:27:52,285 --> 00:27:53,995
one show where they're like you'd try

799
00:27:53,995 --> 00:27:55,795
out how you would do right gel

800
00:27:55,795 --> 00:27:58,045
addition yeah it's just there's so there's

801
00:27:58,105 --> 00:27:59,455
it's such a big part of so

802
00:27:59,455 --> 00:28:01,975
many people in this country's experiments like

803
00:28:03,175 --> 00:28:04,765
there must be something to know but

804
00:28:04,765 --> 00:28:07,045
don't get any weirdness so many people

805
00:28:07,045 --> 00:28:09,085
are doing that jail is a thing

806
00:28:09,085 --> 00:28:11,065
it sounds so like yes you should

807
00:28:11,065 --> 00:28:13,615
be spanking so yeah give me twenty

808
00:28:13,615 --> 00:28:15,295
spankings i love doing yeah why don't

809
00:28:15,295 --> 00:28:17,485
we take the canings like they do

810
00:28:17,485 --> 00:28:19,181
in that where was single yeah where

811
00:28:19,195 --> 00:28:20,755
is it but it's so crazy when

812
00:28:20,755 --> 00:28:21,625
you think of all people i mean

813
00:28:21,625 --> 00:28:22,105
there's not

814
00:28:22,735 --> 00:28:24,445
whatever to google or a loved up

815
00:28:24,445 --> 00:28:26,545
for doing something so dumb and that

816
00:28:26,574 --> 00:28:28,795
oh yeah drug offenses yeah them they're

817
00:28:28,825 --> 00:28:30,807
in there forever it's just that's devastating

818
00:28:30,807 --> 00:28:32,755
and you ruin people that way yeah

819
00:28:33,422 --> 00:28:35,155

00:38:29,965 --> 00:38:32,065
months instead of every six months so

1105
00:38:32,065 --> 00:38:33,115
i was doing that for awhile then

1106
00:38:33,115 --> 00:38:34,915
moved to new york we were therefore

1107
00:38:34,975 --> 00:38:36,565
a year and i never went to

1108
00:38:36,565 --> 00:38:37,525
the dentist while i was there i

1109
00:38:37,525 --> 00:38:40,045
never i never found anybody and i

1110
00:38:40,045 --> 00:38:41,035
just like they fell by

1111
00:38:41,065 --> 00:38:42,595
the wayside and when i came back

1112
00:38:43,195 --> 00:38:44,995
i went to the day i found

1113
00:38:44,995 --> 00:38:46,075
a new dentist and went to the

1114
00:38:46,075 --> 00:38:47,485
dentist and it's like a new day

1115
00:38:47,515 --> 00:38:48,685
it was and it was fine it

1116
00:38:48,685 --> 00:38:49,435
was like i didn't have to go

1117
00:38:49,465 --> 00:38:51,295
every three minutes they will we'll have

1118
00:38:51,295 --> 00:38:53,365
the same right now they want is

1119
00:38:53,365 --> 00:38:55,105
that the new thing know like you

1120
00:38:55,105 --> 00:38:56,515
to do that as a three times

1121
00:38:56,515 --> 00:38:57,625
a year someone's but yeah have to

1122
00:38:57,625 --> 00:38:59,785
go for every four months i had

1123
00:38:59,785 --> 00:39:01,195
been obsessing about it though for three

1124
00:39:01,195 --> 00:39:02,965
three years at that point like it

1125
00:39:02,965 --> 00:39:04,585
had been on my mind and been

1126
00:39:04,585 --> 00:39:06,535
like your man or yourself worse right

1127
00:39:06,535 --> 00:39:07,675
yeah you're horrible and then i went

1128
00:39:07,705 --> 00:39:09,595
into such a like alright later because

1130
00:39:10,735 --> 00:39:12,145

1133
00:39:15,385 --> 00:39:17,275

true

1137
00:39:21,385 --> 00:39:22,345

was at the dentist i was like

1208
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:53,980
is this because you don't have an

1209
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:55,330
extra person to thing that goes in

1210
00:41:55,330 --> 00:41:56,650

00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:11,140
like oh was getting into your throat

1220
00:42:11,230 --> 00:42:13,030
why is it not gotten better one

1221
00:42:13,090 --> 00:42:15,940
time they gave me child-sized version and

1222
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:17,320
it didn't hurt at all like then

1223
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:18,460
they kept giving me the giant ones

1224
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:20,440
again i'm like it cuts your whole

1225
00:42:20,470 --> 00:42:23,410
mouth inside like a small version knows

1226
00:42:23,410 --> 00:42:24,970
my mouth was cut today that it

1227
00:42:24,970 --> 00:42:26,620
might be ah it's like i stick

1228
00:42:26,655 --> 00:42:28,390
a car goes to worse for me

1229
00:42:28,390 --> 00:42:30,160
i can't figure out about doctors is

1230
00:42:30,270 --> 00:42:31,510
i went to i went to see

1231
00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:33,400
my doctors this year and he's like

1232
00:42:33,430 --> 00:42:36,010
alright well here's the part that is

1233
00:42:36,010 --> 00:42:38,350
always uncomfortable and you know the whole

1234
00:42:38,350 --> 00:42:39,048
the bill

1235
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:43,510
yeah

1236
00:42:45,070 --> 00:42:45,550
grey

1237
00:42:47,770 --> 00:42:50,770
are you are you bankrupt yeah i

1238
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,150
go to the doctor too

1239
00:42:54,070 --> 00:42:55,598
no but the the finger of the

1240
00:42:55,750 --> 00:42:56,080
bud

1241
00:42:57,100 --> 00:42:58,870
yeah all the time for man it's

1242
00:42:58,990 --> 00:43:01,540
all the tie my whole point is

1243
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:01,990
like

1244
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:05,860
but it's says it's a standard procedure

1245
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:07,660
yeah yeah certain age yes yes so

1246
00:43:07,675 --> 00:43:09,670
my point is like this would be

1247
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:12,340
job one of like fuck curing cancer

1248
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:13,420
if i were a doctor it would

1249
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:14,860
be like that we gotta figure out

1250
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:16,210
another way to do it yeah you

1251
00:43:16,210 --> 00:43:17,320
gotta have a tool that can do

1252
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:19,960
something yeah still the best way yeah

1253
00:43:20,020 --> 00:43:21,010
that's what he was saying he's like

1254
00:43:21,010 --> 00:43:22,630
there's really no other way to do

1255
00:43:22,630 --> 00:43:23,140
this so

1256
00:43:23,290 --> 00:43:24,820
let's do he could duke e to

1257
00:43:24,910 --> 00:43:25,360
me

1258
00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:28,390
do you gotta be cleared out now

1259
00:43:28,390 --> 00:43:30,670
that he doesn't you know it's probably

1260
00:43:30,670 --> 00:43:32,530
better if you don't because there's a

1261
00:43:32,530 --> 00:43:34,480
lot more to work with because less

1262
00:43:36,370 --> 00:43:40,030
no a hefty size what feature is

1263
00:43:40,030 --> 00:43:42,790
thirty two toothless vegetables anyway i instruments

1264
00:43:42,790 --> 00:43:45,490
on the chest oh yeah i find

1265
00:43:45,490 --> 00:43:48,640
it to be a it's emasculating no

1266
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:50,170
guys able i will you like find

1267
00:43:50,230 --> 00:43:52,330
the opposite wavering i find like a

1268
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:54,340
thundershirt i like the extra i like

1269
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:55,270
the question

1270
00:43:55,690 --> 00:43:58,300
because it's so it's so formal and

1271
00:43:58,300 --> 00:44:00,010
it's so like there's something that's very

1272
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:01,930
intimate about it and it's also very

1273
00:44:01,930 --> 00:44:03,730
like old fashioned like you don't have

1274
00:44:03,730 --> 00:44:05,080
a deal you can put in front

1275
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:06,850
of me and put this almost like

1276
00:44:06,850 --> 00:44:09,340
essentially obviously that's the easiest thing to

1277
00:44:09,370 --> 00:44:11,230
to put them right there it's like

1278
00:44:11,230 --> 00:44:13,000
my it's the shortest distance to my

1279
00:44:13,090 --> 00:44:15,130
right right but there's something i love

1280
00:44:15,130 --> 00:44:15,820
that they have to add

1281
00:44:15,858 --> 00:44:17,380
ask i don't know why it it

1282
00:44:17,470 --> 00:44:20,860
it weirdly touches me oh interesting anyway

1283
00:44:20,950 --> 00:44:22,360
just off we look up

1284

but then what an insane lied to

1485
00:52:41,205 --> 00:52:42,975

someone's life well what what happened that

1492
00:52:56,325 --> 00:52:57,285

1498
00:53:04,431 --> 00:53:06,375
way to rationalize it but i have
