with imams like what's so good about

198
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,190
it is that each color does something

199
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:51,420
else you will take when you eat

200
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:52,470

tan let me yeah it was a

209
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:07,680

00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:15,180
what would you ever when there was

216
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:17,340
the competition to choose the new color

217
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:18,480
you call it

218
00:07:20,778 --> 00:07:22,650

00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,560
pantone door pissed yeah like this is

221
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,060
our domain why do they pick a

222
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:31,740
color every year who cares if nothing

223
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:31,950
else

224
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:35,217
see you're just waiting for it every

225
00:07:35,217 --> 00:07:36,840
yeah all they're doing is giving out

226
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,120
little cards with colors on there like

227
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,100
look the sears color is jade and

228
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:43,860
it's like we don't do anything with

229
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:47,340
that information how often do you paint

230
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:50,700
your house every day yeah same same

231
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:55,980
every every day the entire exterior iowa

232
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:57,780
okay i'm dying i've a few things

233
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:58,980
ok well first of all i would

234
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:00,750
love to paint the house a different

235
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,160
color but it seems like such a

236
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:04,350
gigantic undertaking and if you don't do

237
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:06,660
it i know but it has to

238
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:07,860
be if you are a real man

239
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,590
yeah that's true if he'd get out

240
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:11,970
there on your fucking ladder and just

241
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:13,500
do it you'd fucking do it yeah

242
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,940
you could do it and probably think

243
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:16,260
that would make me start smoking again

244
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,690
yeah you find you hate moto z

245
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:20,400

251
00:08:29,070 --> 00:08:30,780

252
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:32,880
then you have a cigarette dress shoes

253
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,860
your your bought your jar of alcohol

254
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:36,630
is like strewn on the floor next

255
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:38,220
to other ground i don't have like

256
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:40,290
a can of bud or something okay

257
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:41,640
well you do you're holding a bud

258
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,810
can but you already drink what other

259
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:44,850
way you drink colt for invention idea

260
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:45,390
cole forty

261
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:48,600
invention idea just came to this was

262
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,160
but it's something else just three came

263
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,740
to me a thing you put around

264
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,690
your beer cam that can hold your

265
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:56,610
cigarette it's like a circular thing you

266
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:57,810
put around your beer can and it

267
00:08:57,810 --> 00:08:59,910
has like a little container or a

268
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:01,860
little slit for your cigarettes so that

269
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:03,630
so that you can pay you describing

270
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:05,340
an ashtray around to beer can not

271
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:06,720
an ashtray necessarily but something

272
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:07,950
that will help because you know how

273
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:09,390
when you're painting and you're holding a

274
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:10,974
beer yeah if you have a cigarette

275
00:09:11,016 --> 00:09:12,060
you gotta hold it in your mouth

276
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:13,450
the entire time well yes but that

277
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:14,973
that is a skill that's the canal

278
00:09:14,973 --> 00:09:16,680
so kinda low what if you wanted

279
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,360
to just put it in this little

280
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:20,580
thing that's attached to your beer then

281
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:22,350
you could just go okay but but

282
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:24,510
so is it it's it's it's horizontal

283
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:26,100
alongside the beer i don't know what

284
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:26,850
direction it's in

285
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:30,480
campbell yeah five degree angle okay when

286
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,370
i smoked i used to love just

287
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:34,020
holding the cigarette in my mouth it's

288
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:37,110
cool i thought i thought smoking is

289
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:39,060
not cool smoking is not always nice

290
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:40,350
it's if there was a period where

291
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:41,430
it was i look at it now

292
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:43,200
and i think it's i can't i'm

293
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:45,330
i i came out so far on

294
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:46,560
the other side that i look at

295
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,040
it it looks

296
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,480
so no matter who it is i

297
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,310
think it's crazy little gracie anyway even

298
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:52,590
if it's like really hot person yeah

299
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:54,960

381
00:12:58,445 --> 00:13:01,085
we're gonna make it discussing like there

382
00:13:01,085 --> 00:13:03,035
was one answer that was like where's

383
00:13:03,065 --> 00:13:04,715
like what's the man's fear part of

384
00:13:04,715 --> 00:13:07,021
woman it was like dairy pillows you'd

385
00:13:07,021 --> 00:13:07,295
like

386
00:13:09,005 --> 00:13:10,145
i would set the episode we were

387
00:13:10,145 --> 00:13:11,615
i think so yeah i don't know

388
00:13:11,615 --> 00:13:12,965
if that's that was the question but

389
00:13:12,995 --> 00:13:16,145
yeah gary pill um so i was

390
00:13:16,145 --> 00:13:18,725
doing the show i was the mc

391
00:13:18,725 --> 00:13:20,525
of the show and the headliner was

392
00:13:20,525 --> 00:13:24,275
this dude i won't say okay um

393
00:13:24,335 --> 00:13:26,525
but he he was just like a

394
00:13:26,525 --> 00:13:28,445
hacky club dude but

395
00:13:28,475 --> 00:13:30,875
his big closer was i think this

396
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:31,715
was his closer

397
00:13:32,825 --> 00:13:33,875
he would get somebody up out of

398
00:13:33,875 --> 00:13:37,475
the audience to do um some sort

399
00:13:37,475 --> 00:13:38,705
of dance too

400
00:13:39,845 --> 00:13:42,605
walk the dinosaur and under what pretense

401
00:13:42,605 --> 00:13:44,675
if you don't mind me asking i

402
00:13:44,705 --> 00:13:46,385
don't remember how he got into it

403
00:13:48,155 --> 00:13:49,925
i'm imagining him saying hey i want

404
00:13:49,925 --> 00:13:51,245
someone from the crowd to come up

405
00:13:51,245 --> 00:13:52,955
and dance to walk the dinosaur yeah

406
00:13:53,405 --> 00:13:54,695
i'm sure it started with like a

407
00:13:54,695 --> 00:13:55,955
guy you know that song walked a

408
00:13:55,955 --> 00:13:58,115
dinosaur and everyone was like yes yeah

409
00:13:58,115 --> 00:13:59,705
we all know we know what i'd

410
00:13:59,705 --> 00:14:01,805
love it it's a queen latifah rebeck

411
00:14:01,817 --> 00:14:04,205
it's a current song that we're enjoying

412
00:14:04,925 --> 00:14:07,595
and so um he would always get

413
00:14:07,595 --> 00:14:09,605
it like an attractive woman out of

414
00:14:09,605 --> 00:14:11,075
the audience to do this with him

415
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:13,415
and how how are there why are

416
00:14:13,415 --> 00:14:15,905
attractive women going to standup shows i

417
00:14:16,055 --> 00:14:18,065
don't know you should um they should

418
00:14:18,065 --> 00:14:21,095
be out there having sex thing we

419
00:14:21,095 --> 00:14:22,558
just stand up you think women with

420
00:14:22,565 --> 00:14:25,325
each having sex instead of continuing laughing

421
00:14:25,355 --> 00:14:27,515
well here's a here's the thing

422
00:14:27,755 --> 00:14:29,495
one night this was like this like

423
00:14:29,495 --> 00:14:31,925
a three night gig a weekend gig

424
00:14:31,985 --> 00:14:34,505
and one night the the woman that

425
00:14:34,549 --> 00:14:37,265
got out of the crowd ah he

426
00:14:37,295 --> 00:14:39,425
convinced to go back to the hotel

427
00:14:39,425 --> 00:14:41,285
with him i don't think that's uncommon

428
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:43,025
know it's not so this is the

429
00:14:43,025 --> 00:14:45,125
whole reason he's doing it yeah exactly

430
00:14:45,155 --> 00:14:46,955
yeah and so if it happened one

431
00:14:46,955 --> 00:14:47,915
of the three nights when

432
00:14:47,945 --> 00:14:50,165
you were with him that's usually his

433
00:14:50,165 --> 00:14:51,689
ratio thirty three percent of the time

434
00:14:51,695 --> 00:14:52,775
i would think so yeah he'll find

435
00:14:52,775 --> 00:14:54,095
someone to come back to zotto and

436
00:14:54,095 --> 00:14:57,335
so um i remember he we were

437
00:14:57,335 --> 00:15:00,245
supposed to be sharing a room and

438
00:15:00,245 --> 00:15:01,655
then when he got this woman to

439
00:15:01,655 --> 00:15:04,025
come back with him he said we're

440
00:15:04,025 --> 00:15:06,335
gonna go in this room if my

441
00:15:06,335 --> 00:15:07,715

this comedian from philly that we both

476
00:16:20,555 --> 00:16:22,355
knew that she thought they had a

477
00:16:22,355 --> 00:16:23,855
thing and then she was discovering that

478
00:16:23,855 --> 00:16:25,405

00:16:25,405 --> 00:16:27,425

502
00:17:08,135 --> 00:17:09,935
thing where when i look back at

503
00:17:09,935 --> 00:17:11,285

504
00:17:11,285 --> 00:17:13,445

00:17:19,775 --> 00:17:21,335
or all the time at the in

510
00:17:21,335 --> 00:17:23,135
that age so is the is the

511
00:17:23,165 --> 00:17:25,025
image of her with her shirt off

512
00:17:25,025 --> 00:17:27,695
walking towards the bedroom door just imprinted

513
00:17:27,695 --> 00:17:29,225
in your mind that is imprinted on

514
00:17:29,225 --> 00:17:32,615
my mind him on stage ah doing

515
00:17:32,615 --> 00:17:34,385
the dinosaur thing with a young woman

516
00:17:34,385 --> 00:17:36,575
and like laughing as she messes up

517
00:17:36,575 --> 00:17:38,135
and all that that's imprinted in my

518
00:17:38,135 --> 00:17:39,575
mind what dance would he make them

519
00:17:39,575 --> 00:17:39,755
do

520
00:17:39,755 --> 00:17:43,295
do all i can remember the only

521
00:17:43,295 --> 00:17:45,597
thing i can remember was a a

522
00:17:45,681 --> 00:17:48,695
sort of mimed like a ah think

523
00:17:48,695 --> 00:17:49,985
it's like what happens in the video

524
00:17:50,195 --> 00:17:51,575
yeah right i can't remember the video

525
00:17:51,575 --> 00:17:53,795
at all yeah but making your hand

526
00:17:53,795 --> 00:17:55,925
into dinosaurs of the end of the

527
00:17:55,985 --> 00:17:57,335
year are your forearm i know but

528
00:17:57,371 --> 00:17:58,835
i feel like your your hand is

529
00:17:58,835 --> 00:17:59,915
the jaw of the dinosaur

530
00:17:59,915 --> 00:18:01,265
not the actual but i don't know

531
00:18:01,265 --> 00:18:03,335
maybe this is the eyes and then

532
00:18:03,335 --> 00:18:05,225
you think there's an invisible head around

533
00:18:05,225 --> 00:18:07,505
there's you're insane you're just gonna bone

534
00:18:07,505 --> 00:18:11,615
structure within skeletal just because you've forgot

535
00:18:11,615 --> 00:18:15,275
that dinosaurs actually did have flesh you

536
00:18:15,275 --> 00:18:16,235
know we don't know you don't know

537
00:18:16,235 --> 00:18:17,555
that they had feather lot of times

538
00:18:17,555 --> 00:18:19,145
dead feathers so we we we think

539
00:18:19,175 --> 00:18:20,045
they had the leathery

540
00:18:20,105 --> 00:18:21,665
skip that feather no one goes the

541
00:18:21,665 --> 00:18:24,095
most direct they were just skeletons yes

542
00:18:24,095 --> 00:18:26,249
exactly let's see why are we hypothesized

543
00:18:26,255 --> 00:18:28,655
having layers to them oh they're proud

544
00:18:28,655 --> 00:18:30,785
salad the bones they were that's when

545
00:18:31,475 --> 00:18:34,355
you see skeletons on halloween they're not

546
00:18:35,075 --> 00:18:37,505
former bodies they are just their skeletal

547
00:18:37,505 --> 00:18:40,145
record that way you imagine giving birth

548
00:18:40,145 --> 00:18:40,235
to

549
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:43,954
i don't know that that's i don't

550
00:18:43,954 --> 00:18:46,475
like you but it learns mine but

551
00:18:46,475 --> 00:18:47,825
it goes away

552
00:18:48,905 --> 00:18:49,955
i don't like this without all the

553
00:18:49,955 --> 00:18:51,185
noise the dial phone noises

a good mustache but it was not

674
00:23:26,585 --> 00:23:28,745
like there's not like a biker oh

he was a guy without it he

679
00:23:35,645 --> 00:23:36,335
was only guy without

680
00:23:37,535 --> 00:23:39,125
well they knew he was undercover most

681
00:23:39,125 --> 00:23:41,795
mustaches of all time so he made

682
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:44,675
an apology for obviously for anyone who

683
00:23:44,675 --> 00:23:47,015
doesn't know he cheated on his girlfriend

684
00:23:47,015 --> 00:23:48,605
with another cast member yeah the show

685
00:23:48,785 --> 00:23:50,645
in under all of our noses for

686
00:23:50,645 --> 00:23:52,265
years and years yes yes yes yeah

687
00:23:52,295 --> 00:23:53,795
well not for years and years but

688
00:23:54,365 --> 00:23:55,535
what he probably cheated with other people

689
00:23:55,535 --> 00:23:56,735
for years i mean you gotta assume

690
00:23:56,735 --> 00:23:57,605
with randolph's

691
00:23:57,695 --> 00:23:59,975
it's tough you know but it is

692
00:24:00,005 --> 00:24:01,955
it this show we we watched it

693
00:24:01,955 --> 00:24:04,325
last night ah ginny and i and

694
00:24:04,355 --> 00:24:07,115
and it is ah i was really

695
00:24:07,115 --> 00:24:08,975
a heavy episode and it's become like

696
00:24:08,975 --> 00:24:11,465
a more of a psychological study than

697
00:24:11,465 --> 00:24:14,370
like a fun reality show yeah it

698
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:16,355
was their world like genuinely tense moments

699
00:24:16,355 --> 00:24:17,135
it was very surprising

700
00:24:17,855 --> 00:24:19,715
i mean it makes sense though i

701
00:24:19,715 --> 00:24:21,125
feel like the stuff that went down

702
00:24:21,125 --> 00:24:22,895
at that point was so real

703
00:24:24,125 --> 00:24:25,625
i don't know about the earlier seasons

704
00:24:26,195 --> 00:24:27,935
but here's his earlier seasons just felt

705
00:24:27,935 --> 00:24:29,225
like a reality show you know anything

706
00:24:29,225 --> 00:24:31,175
i was like messi being messi yeah

707
00:24:31,295 --> 00:24:33,305
here's his apology style though it's like

708
00:24:33,785 --> 00:24:35,285
hey i just wanted to check in

709
00:24:35,285 --> 00:24:37,145
with you like that's not an apology

710
00:24:37,415 --> 00:24:39,275
he will when he says i'm sorry

711
00:24:39,305 --> 00:24:41,405
it's always i'm sorry but i'm sorry

712
00:24:41,405 --> 00:24:42,665
but you know it was just a

713
00:24:42,665 --> 00:24:44,165
tough time and this is something that

714
00:24:44,495 --> 00:24:45,845
yeah so what about what about this

715
00:24:45,845 --> 00:24:47,135
because well what about what you did

716
00:24:47,135 --> 00:24:49,205
to me yeah exactly because that's always

717
00:24:49,205 --> 00:24:50,465
gonna everyone around him is always saying

718
00:24:50,465 --> 00:24:52,055
like you just need to just sit

719
00:24:52,115 --> 00:24:54,395
here and take it yeah exactly that's

720
00:24:54,395 --> 00:24:56,285
what everyone gets the exact same advice

721
00:24:56,375 --> 00:24:58,505
just like i'm doing that already anyway

722
00:24:58,543 --> 00:25:00,275
you're trying to do that by doing

723
00:25:00,275 --> 00:25:02,105
toughest test he was like i deserve

724
00:25:02,105 --> 00:25:04,235

00:25:04,415 --> 00:25:06,276

i couldn't believe how weak he was

730
00:25:15,335 --> 00:25:16,175

siwa did amazingly well there was a

734
00:25:22,535 --> 00:25:24,365
point where i believe tom was having

735
00:25:24,365 --> 00:25:26,435
a really hard time carrying a person

736
00:25:26,435 --> 00:25:28,145
or a big bag or something because

737
00:25:28,145 --> 00:25:29,435

00:26:16,415 --> 00:26:19,385
batch noble we've learned from him learned

764
00:26:19,385 --> 00:26:20,915
what that he's an amazing shots to

765
00:26:20,945 --> 00:26:22,925

00:26:22,955 --> 00:26:24,635
scrambling eggs we started doing it like

767
00:26:24,635 --> 00:26:26,670
when it was really great wow how

768
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:28,385
what are his techniques to scramble these

769
00:26:28,415 --> 00:26:30,515
e put them in a pan using

770
00:26:30,515 --> 00:26:32,165
no he used a pot he used

771
00:26:32,165 --> 00:26:33,575
to pot he cracked them into a

772
00:26:33,575 --> 00:26:36,185
pot okay how big medium

773
00:26:36,605 --> 00:26:37,955
so tom sandoval could not lift it

774
00:26:38,105 --> 00:26:41,675
yeah and it was full of was

775
00:26:41,795 --> 00:26:44,285
whipping and then he puts in butter

776
00:26:44,285 --> 00:26:45,337
and then he put in chrome fresh

777
00:26:45,365 --> 00:26:46,505
and he also put ooni i mean

778
00:26:46,505 --> 00:26:47,975
i didn't do all this shit what

779
00:26:47,975 --> 00:26:49,523
did you do you just put it

780
00:26:49,895 --> 00:26:51,453
on a pie and it was but

781
00:26:51,453 --> 00:26:54,005
we just ordered them no actually restaurant

782
00:26:54,035 --> 00:26:55,355

783
00:26:55,425 --> 00:26:56,525
start with trying to cook now

784
00:26:56,765 --> 00:26:57,635
i don't wanna get into that but

00:26:57,635 --> 00:26:59,285

786
00:26:59,315 --> 00:27:00,815

794
00:27:14,525 --> 00:27:16,625

796
00:27:18,907 --> 00:27:19,955

need you know paul knows they turned

798
00:27:21,775 --> 00:27:24,125

00:27:44,135 --> 00:27:46,055

00:27:57,485 --> 00:27:59,765
he he will come into these restaurants

817
00:27:59,765 --> 00:28:02,825
that are gross they're nightmare he has

818
00:28:02,825 --> 00:28:04,925
the best he has the best phrases

819
00:28:04,925 --> 00:28:06,935
and so we love to say but

820
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:07,715
our own kitchen

821
00:28:10,385 --> 00:28:10,625
this

822
00:28:14,585 --> 00:28:15,763
it's okay to say

823
00:28:17,045 --> 00:28:21,455
ah

824
00:28:22,745 --> 00:28:25,175
ah try to do something in the

825
00:28:25,195 --> 00:28:26,735
space it's like two scholars

826
00:28:28,675 --> 00:28:30,155
i hear the lord

827
00:28:31,295 --> 00:28:32,765
a little jiggle so well

828
00:28:39,995 --> 00:28:40,955
this place isn't

829
00:28:41,885 --> 00:28:49,805
ah i know here's what i send

830
00:28:49,805 --> 00:28:51,815
me i've had this thought flashed in

831
00:28:51,815 --> 00:28:53,525
my mind that years from now when

832
00:28:53,525 --> 00:28:56,615
your children are grown that a sweet

833
00:28:56,615 --> 00:28:58,115
thing to tell them would be that

834
00:28:58,115 --> 00:29:00,275
you laughed so much oh that's so

835
00:29:00,275 --> 00:29:02,015
nice oh because

836
00:29:02,015 --> 00:29:03,447
it really is true what you like

837
00:29:03,447 --> 00:29:06,515
your partner giggly is true as sweet

838
00:29:06,815 --> 00:29:08,795
and then the third thing about whatever

839
00:29:08,795 --> 00:29:10,055
his name is is it a bonus

840
00:29:10,055 --> 00:29:11,225
thing this is no this was the

841
00:29:11,225 --> 00:29:13,535
main number two but then the thing

842
00:29:13,535 --> 00:29:15,665
i just said became a module it

843
00:29:15,665 --> 00:29:17,615
was the thing that the dust chopping

844
00:29:17,615 --> 00:29:18,665
was really part you were trying to

845
00:29:18,665 --> 00:29:20,915
tie one and two together but there's

846
00:29:20,915 --> 00:29:22,175
no lauren come

847
00:29:22,565 --> 00:29:24,365
three things so your if it was

848
00:29:24,365 --> 00:29:25,205
going to be one thing it was

849
00:29:25,205 --> 00:29:25,985
going to be we think he's a

850
00:29:25,985 --> 00:29:27,905
great chef but he has these great

851
00:29:27,905 --> 00:29:30,515
phrases no it was and he does

852
00:29:30,515 --> 00:29:34,445
this thing okay and the next one

853
00:29:34,445 --> 00:29:35,705
is that at the end of the

854
00:29:35,705 --> 00:29:37,775
episode he read he sort of recaps

855
00:29:37,775 --> 00:29:39,785
like what happened to the camera by

856
00:29:39,785 --> 00:29:41,585
himself outside of the restaurant standing outside

857
00:29:41,645 --> 00:29:42,335
like encase

858
00:29:42,365 --> 00:29:43,985
you didn't watch it he just kind

859
00:29:43,985 --> 00:29:46,535
of like here's what i did here's

860
00:29:46,535 --> 00:29:47,525
what we didn't hear just how you

861
00:29:47,525 --> 00:29:48,875
feel for them and here's like what

862
00:29:48,875 --> 00:29:50,825
like hopefully they have to do to

863
00:29:50,825 --> 00:29:51,785
make this work and then we'll come

864
00:29:51,785 --> 00:29:53,195
back to like here's six months later

865
00:29:53,195 --> 00:29:54,365
we'll see what happens they have to

866
00:29:54,365 --> 00:29:58,865
add he will look around we've deduced

867
00:29:58,955 --> 00:29:59,345
okay

868
00:30:00,815 --> 00:30:01,955
that his cue cards are on the

869
00:30:01,955 --> 00:30:04,775
ground because he's like we're looking over

870
00:30:04,775 --> 00:30:06,545
here and he looks down over here

871
00:30:06,545 --> 00:30:07,655
and he's like he's he looks at

872
00:30:07,655 --> 00:30:08,975
the camera and he's like and then

873
00:30:08,975 --> 00:30:10,085
they had it's you know so many

874
00:30:10,085 --> 00:30:12,007
pots and pans and then they suddenly

875
00:30:12,007 --> 00:30:13,475
he's like adding something else he's like

876
00:30:13,745 --> 00:30:15,605
yeah he's not he's a he's a

877
00:30:15,605 --> 00:30:17,255
downward thinker you know how like when

878
00:30:17,255 --> 00:30:18,575
some people think they think up to

879
00:30:18,575 --> 00:30:20,345
the right or whatever well so

880
00:30:21,405 --> 00:30:22,725
posted about this and we were like

881
00:30:22,755 --> 00:30:24,015
oh my god other people are noticing

882
00:30:24,015 --> 00:30:26,145
this then we watch the master class

883
00:30:26,535 --> 00:30:27,795
he's looking down at that table there's

884
00:30:27,795 --> 00:30:29,835
nothing on it when he's talking he

885
00:30:29,835 --> 00:30:32,910
is a downward downward thinker hold on

886
00:30:33,029 --> 00:30:34,215
wow hold on a sec because he's

887
00:30:34,215 --> 00:30:35,685
looking down and saying stuff as if

888
00:30:35,685 --> 00:30:38,175
it's referencing notes but there's nothing there

889
00:30:38,205 --> 00:30:39,885
i don't mean to sound all tinfoil

890
00:30:39,885 --> 00:30:40,725
hat okay

891
00:30:41,685 --> 00:30:44,325
but maybe before the masterclass he saw

892
00:30:44,325 --> 00:30:46,515
that people were onto him oh he

893
00:30:46,515 --> 00:30:47,985
was like this is this ice i

894
00:30:47,985 --> 00:30:49,935
gotta memorize this shit and remember to

895
00:30:49,935 --> 00:30:52,575
look down yeah so he's looking up

896
00:30:52,575 --> 00:30:53,925
and thinking yeah i gotta remember to

897
00:30:53,925 --> 00:30:55,545
look down and then he looks down

898
00:30:55,725 --> 00:30:57,345
it's just remember look i just feel

899
00:30:57,345 --> 00:30:58,485
like they could help him in the

900
00:30:58,905 --> 00:31:01,395
sky because when he's looking down it

901
00:31:01,395 --> 00:31:01,662
looks

902
00:31:01,695 --> 00:31:04,245
so distracting lots of things is they

903
00:31:04,245 --> 00:31:05,535
say that you can tell if someone's

904
00:31:05,535 --> 00:31:07,485
lying if they're not when they're remembering

905
00:31:07,485 --> 00:31:09,285
something if they're like looking up into

906
00:31:09,285 --> 00:31:11,295
i believe it's the left because then

907
00:31:11,295 --> 00:31:13,335
they're like pretending that's when you see

908
00:31:13,335 --> 00:31:15,915
your imagination is you have to go

909
00:31:15,915 --> 00:31:16,905
up to the left like look in

910
00:31:16,935 --> 00:31:18,555
your imagination it's like when people actually

911
00:31:18,555 --> 00:31:20,505
lie when people are trying to remember

912
00:31:20,505 --> 00:31:21,675
something it was to the right

913
00:31:23,295 --> 00:31:24,675
when people are really trying to remember

914
00:31:24,675 --> 00:31:26,925
something they look up and to one

915
00:31:26,925 --> 00:31:29,925
direction they look to one direction i

916
00:31:29,925 --> 00:31:31,245
always look in one direction and you

917
00:31:31,245 --> 00:31:32,745
know what i still think harry's going

918
00:31:32,745 --> 00:31:33,795
to get back together with i think

919
00:31:33,795 --> 00:31:35,535
he will eventually i mean justin got

920
00:31:35,565 --> 00:31:37,185
back together with n seeing that tray

921
00:31:37,665 --> 00:31:39,735
and think and think and think

922
00:31:41,085 --> 00:31:43,064
was it an apostrophe n semi was

923
00:31:43,064 --> 00:31:44,955
star and sink maybe even it could

924
00:31:44,955 --> 00:31:46,695
be possible i don't know let me

925
00:31:46,695 --> 00:31:47,805
look i want to look at like

926
00:31:48,585 --> 00:31:51,375
when you're thinking or when you're lying

927
00:31:51,405 --> 00:31:53,295
why were the backstreet boys the backstory

928
00:31:53,295 --> 00:31:56,445
look well they were all born in

929
00:31:56,445 --> 00:31:59,175
alleys in dumpsters you know what asked

930
00:31:59,175 --> 00:31:59,925
and answered yeah

931
00:32:00,975 --> 00:32:01,965
did not know that they were all

932
00:32:01,965 --> 00:32:04,394
dumpster baby yeah one of them was

933
00:32:04,395 --> 00:32:06,165
a toilet baby i was gonna say

934
00:32:06,165 --> 00:32:08,205
moved him to a dumpster because yeah

935
00:32:08,235 --> 00:32:11,085
you embarrassed jaycee she's a saint michel

936
00:32:11,205 --> 00:32:12,485
it's a myth he was born in

937
00:32:12,495 --> 00:32:14,535
a sink actually it's a myth

938
00:32:15,645 --> 00:32:17,355
but that's the thing is like all

939
00:32:17,355 --> 00:32:18,489
the backstreet boys they were born in

940
00:32:18,525 --> 00:32:19,095
six

941
00:32:20,586 --> 00:32:21,735
okay i know this is a myth

942
00:32:21,735 --> 00:32:22,695
that people i didn't know i was

943
00:32:22,725 --> 00:32:23,835
pregnant but i looked at the sake

944
00:32:23,835 --> 00:32:25,545
there was a baby it was debunked

945
00:32:25,725 --> 00:32:29,025
debunked but michelle a university of michigan

946
00:32:29,025 --> 00:32:31,905
study found when participants lied they maintained

947
00:32:31,905 --> 00:32:33,495
eye contact seventy percent of the time

948
00:32:34,125 --> 00:32:35,685
i do think that's actually more accurate

949
00:32:35,685 --> 00:32:36,675
because like you're trying to be like

950
00:32:37,035 --> 00:32:38,805
i like i'm being yeah right okay

951
00:32:38,895 --> 00:32:40,065
i'm not blinking or and i have

952
00:32:40,065 --> 00:32:40,301
nothing

953
00:32:40,365 --> 00:32:42,315
be afraid of i'm just looking i'm

954
00:32:42,315 --> 00:32:44,145
looking at you normally yeah with my

955
00:32:44,145 --> 00:32:45,945
eyes wide open that is that's the

956
00:32:45,945 --> 00:32:47,025
other guy when i read the book

957
00:32:47,025 --> 00:32:49,035
homicide um like holen life on the

958
00:32:49,035 --> 00:32:50,325
streets i don't know if it had

959
00:32:50,325 --> 00:32:52,965
a colon in the book but i

960
00:32:52,965 --> 00:32:55,065
believe it's just smaller lettering under homicide

961
00:32:55,455 --> 00:32:56,655
i don't think there was any life

962
00:32:56,655 --> 00:32:57,765
on the street in the book i

963
00:32:57,765 --> 00:32:59,625
think it's just called homicide i could

964
00:32:59,625 --> 00:33:00,495
be wrong but ah

965
00:33:00,495 --> 00:33:01,965
hope you are at like i was

966
00:33:01,965 --> 00:33:03,525
probably wrong about instinct not having an

967
00:33:03,525 --> 00:33:05,685
apostrophe but um actually you know the

968
00:33:05,685 --> 00:33:08,355
wikipedia page for instinct has just the

969
00:33:08,355 --> 00:33:09,495
end in the sink next to each

970
00:33:09,495 --> 00:33:10,815

a book homicide is that ah guilty

1028
00:35:28,575 --> 00:35:31,635
people when they bring them into the

1029
00:35:31,695 --> 00:35:34,185
interrogation room they always fall asleep oh

1030
00:35:34,245 --> 00:35:36,015
and this is according to cops yes

1031
00:35:36,135 --> 00:35:36,435
okay

1032
00:35:38,595 --> 00:35:41,895
liars policy guilty people when they get

1033
00:35:42,285 --> 00:35:45,045
interrogation they always fall asleep well i

1034
00:35:45,045 --> 00:35:46,905
know somebody who when they were caught

1035
00:35:46,905 --> 00:35:49,365
doing something like cotton and i know

1036
00:35:49,365 --> 00:35:52,125
this story they fainted but it was

1037
00:35:52,125 --> 00:35:54,195
pretty easy to like what you've done

1038
00:35:54,705 --> 00:35:56,955
oh my feeling is like falling asleep

1039
00:35:56,955 --> 00:35:57,615
is like a sort of

1040
00:35:57,615 --> 00:35:59,355
of tactics like i'm not even here

1041
00:35:59,355 --> 00:36:00,853
i can't do about this you can't

1042
00:36:00,853 --> 00:36:03,232
wake me up it's rude but i

1043
00:36:03,419 --> 00:36:04,665
also trying to use and you can't

1044
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:05,918
give me longer than twenty four hours

1045
00:36:06,075 --> 00:36:07,545
i sleep for twenty four hours yeah

1046
00:36:07,575 --> 00:36:08,985
dammit he fell asleep i have a

1047
00:36:08,985 --> 00:36:10,695
friend who used to interview celebrities for

1048
00:36:10,695 --> 00:36:12,705
like e and stuff and she would

1049
00:36:12,705 --> 00:36:14,475
get very sleepy like in exchange for

1050
00:36:14,475 --> 00:36:16,515
ecstasy the first one interview celebrity yeah

1051
00:36:16,515 --> 00:36:17,415
just john tesh

1052
00:36:18,255 --> 00:36:19,935
you would get once you get nervous

1053
00:36:19,935 --> 00:36:21,615
about certain people should get really sleepy

1054
00:36:21,885 --> 00:36:23,475
yeah so that's what that's what i

1055
00:36:23,475 --> 00:36:24,525
think they were trying to say is

1056
00:36:24,525 --> 00:36:27,945
like these people are so nervous about

1057
00:36:27,945 --> 00:36:29,595
being caught that they tend to fall

1058
00:36:29,595 --> 00:36:31,215
asleep like it's a it's a

1059
00:36:32,415 --> 00:36:34,815
i don't know that's so great i'm

1060
00:36:34,815 --> 00:36:37,451
like i was watching caught my adrenalin

1061
00:36:37,455 --> 00:36:39,105
would be higher than it's ever been

1062
00:36:39,315 --> 00:36:40,725
they also tell a very funny story

1063
00:36:40,725 --> 00:36:42,285
about how they would use the copier

1064
00:36:42,285 --> 00:36:45,075
machine as a lie detector supposedly where

1065
00:36:45,075 --> 00:36:47,145
they would put in the third piece

1066
00:36:47,145 --> 00:36:49,605
of paper ah the the first piece

1067
00:36:49,605 --> 00:36:51,345
of paper when you're loading the paper

1068
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:52,575
yeah it would be blank

1069
00:36:52,635 --> 00:36:53,745
the second piece of paper would be

1070
00:36:53,745 --> 00:36:55,035
blank and then they'd load a third

1071
00:36:55,035 --> 00:36:56,415
piece of paper that would say lie

1072
00:36:56,865 --> 00:36:58,725
and they would ask they go okay

1073
00:36:58,725 --> 00:37:00,465
we have randomly we have a lookout

1074
00:37:00,495 --> 00:37:01,815
we we have a lie detector here

1075
00:37:01,815 --> 00:37:02,925
and they would ask a question like

1076
00:37:02,925 --> 00:37:04,845
what's your name the person entity would

1077
00:37:04,845 --> 00:37:06,195
press the button and a blank piece

1078
00:37:06,195 --> 00:37:07,363
of paper would come out like a

1079
00:37:07,363 --> 00:37:08,505
where do you live they would say

1080
00:37:08,505 --> 00:37:09,795
a blank piece of paper would come

1081
00:37:09,795 --> 00:37:11,805
out did you kill that person no

1082
00:37:11,805 --> 00:37:12,735

00:38:37,365 --> 00:38:39,045
we should do a disney day where

1130
00:38:39,045 --> 00:38:41,025
we record from disneyland yeah that would

1131
00:38:41,025 --> 00:38:42,615
be so fun i did a podcast

1132
00:38:42,615 --> 00:38:43,905
from digital so any time you did

1133
00:38:43,905 --> 00:38:45,492
a podcast from that did did did

1134
00:38:45,515 --> 00:38:46,995
did disneyland yeah don't be scared

1135
00:38:48,675 --> 00:38:51,225
this was this today's podcast called walking

1136
00:38:51,225 --> 00:38:54,465
with michelle i was fishing with michelle

1137
00:38:54,465 --> 00:38:55,815
that was the theme song i bet

1138
00:38:55,815 --> 00:38:58,035
it was and i by michelle balloon

1139
00:38:58,095 --> 00:38:59,445
atlanta com yeah oh yeah when that

1140
00:38:59,445 --> 00:39:02,865
song came philly i thought it was

1141
00:39:02,955 --> 00:39:06,735
old like a seventy song why the

1142
00:39:06,735 --> 00:39:07,395
way it sounds

1143
00:39:08,715 --> 00:39:09,885
and then i learned it also the

1144
00:39:09,885 --> 00:39:12,345
way your brain is young you receive

1145
00:39:12,345 --> 00:39:13,695
that information when i heard it i

1146
00:39:13,695 --> 00:39:14,925
was like this is like a cool

1147
00:39:14,925 --> 00:39:16,845
retro song and then it was new

1148
00:39:16,905 --> 00:39:18,045
okay so the idea was we're going

1149
00:39:18,045 --> 00:39:19,620
to go there we were gonna record

1150
00:39:19,635 --> 00:39:20,685
a podcast from she was going to

1151
00:39:20,685 --> 00:39:23,145
go various places and record a podcast

1152
00:39:23,145 --> 00:39:24,705
with guest right and so the first

1153
00:39:24,705 --> 00:39:27,465
one was disneyland and this was me

1154
00:39:27,465 --> 00:39:28,335
and her produce

1155
00:39:28,365 --> 00:39:29,775
sir matt belknap whom you might know

1156
00:39:29,775 --> 00:39:32,355
from never not funny yes and this

1157
00:39:32,355 --> 00:39:34,215
is this is early podcasting data silent

1158
00:39:34,215 --> 00:39:34,575
killer

1159
00:39:36,015 --> 00:39:37,695
that's right because he has a silent

1160
00:39:37,695 --> 00:39:39,647
k on his name that's why that's

1161
00:39:39,647 --> 00:39:41,415
great so i call him cholesterol sometimes

1162
00:39:41,595 --> 00:39:43,815
well that's fun decidedly killer i thought

1163
00:39:43,815 --> 00:39:45,585
hypertension was the silent killer i think

1164
00:39:45,585 --> 00:39:47,025
there's a lot of silent killers too

1165
00:39:47,025 --> 00:39:48,825
many so many don't announce like oh

1166
00:39:48,855 --> 00:39:51,405
yeah like talk to us guys so

1167
00:39:51,615 --> 00:39:53,985
yeah we recorded this on a sunday

1168
00:39:54,015 --> 00:39:55,935
morning perfect sunday

1169
00:39:55,965 --> 00:39:59,265
morning day after i went to a

1170
00:39:59,295 --> 00:40:02,745
friend's wedding ooh bad timing bad timing

1171
00:40:02,775 --> 00:40:05,355
and then we discovered that the reason

1172
00:40:05,355 --> 00:40:06,855
we were doing it we had to

1173
00:40:06,855 --> 00:40:08,505
be a disneyland at ten a m

1174
00:40:09,285 --> 00:40:12,285
was that he thought there would be

1175
00:40:12,315 --> 00:40:14,835
ah less traffic and fewer people there

1176
00:40:14,895 --> 00:40:15,855
so how that works

1177
00:40:16,095 --> 00:40:17,745
it's absolutely not how that works there's

1178
00:40:17,745 --> 00:40:19,875
less traffic and fewer people at like

1179
00:40:19,875 --> 00:40:22,605
seven pm yeah yeah digital and it

about benedict i i saw something recently

that led me to believe that i

1226
00:42:14,975 --> 00:42:16,505
guess certain people think that he was

1227
00:42:16,535 --> 00:42:18,245
framed or he was trying to do

1228
00:42:18,245 --> 00:42:22,475

1229
00:42:22,475 --> 00:42:23,465
i know who you're talking about

1230
00:42:24,665 --> 00:42:26,105

much money getting it on

1246
00:43:02,855 --> 00:43:03,845
you know but the whole thing was

1247
00:43:03,845 --> 00:43:05,765
like we're the future of science we've

1248
00:43:05,765 --> 00:43:07,145

great commercials if only i was given

1254
00:43:16,895 --> 00:43:18,275

1256
00:43:19,895 --> 00:43:21,095
that you should be in it i

know youtube could write great cover i

1258
00:43:22,505 --> 00:43:23,795
think if i wanted to if you

1259
00:43:23,795 --> 00:43:24,875
put his mind when you read a

1260
00:43:24,875 --> 00:43:27,965
jingle songs should just be commercial like

1261
00:43:27,965 --> 00:43:31,205
which yeah like expert will but you

1262
00:43:31,205 --> 00:43:31,925
know what a lot of them were

1263
00:43:31,925 --> 00:43:33,305

your stam

1482
00:50:20,195 --> 00:50:21,815

1483
00:50:21,815 --> 00:50:22,865

it's unlimited okay you can go up

1486
00:50:26,705 --> 00:50:27,995
and down the stairs as many times

1487
00:50:27,995 --> 00:50:28,895
so we pay it that's part of

1488
00:50:28,895 --> 00:50:30,425
the mortgage we're paying for unlimited stare

1489
00:50:30,425 --> 00:50:33,785
usage yes ah um it has crown

1490
00:50:33,785 --> 00:50:35,585
moldings or a way to discount it

1491
00:50:35,585 --> 00:50:36,575
if we don't ever want to go

1492
00:50:36,575 --> 00:50:38,825
upstairs i can talk to the seller

1493
00:50:39,625 --> 00:50:41,485
yeah well there's something i saw no

1494
00:50:41,496 --> 00:50:42,505
i just want to be a little

1495
00:50:42,535 --> 00:50:43,855
but i think we should just tell

1496
00:50:43,855 --> 00:50:46,375
him yeah we were poking around outside

1497
00:50:46,375 --> 00:50:48,235
kind of peering through windows okay and

1498
00:50:48,235 --> 00:50:50,245
we saw i think what's a huge

1499
00:50:50,245 --> 00:50:53,755
problem it's definitely a problem i i

1500
00:50:53,935 --> 00:50:55,105
i don't so well

1501
00:50:56,635 --> 00:50:58,045
i think i know what you're talking

1502
00:50:58,045 --> 00:50:59,575
about i hope so i mean it's

1503
00:50:59,575 --> 00:51:02,155
huge i would say it's affecting the

1504
00:51:02,155 --> 00:51:05,155
whole thing right but look at it

1505
00:51:05,155 --> 00:51:07,345
as i know that it seems like

1506
00:51:07,345 --> 00:51:08,935
a problem from the outside looking in

1507
00:51:09,895 --> 00:51:10,765
but i think it would be worse

1508
00:51:10,765 --> 00:51:13,525
when we're inside it's an opportunity to

1509
00:51:13,525 --> 00:51:16,345
what to to do something

1510
00:51:16,345 --> 00:51:18,055
that you've never done a house before

1511
00:51:18,565 --> 00:51:20,815
a swim i don't think it's yes

1512
00:51:21,715 --> 00:51:23,815
that's one thing okay but i one

1513
00:51:23,815 --> 00:51:26,005
thing you pretend to go fishing yeah

1514
00:51:26,005 --> 00:51:27,235
i don't think that any fish could

1515
00:51:27,235 --> 00:51:28,765
survive doesn't seem sample that's why i

1516
00:51:28,765 --> 00:51:31,061
said pretend okay that's a good point

1517
00:51:31,225 --> 00:51:32,875
did he pretend to know but imagine

1518
00:51:32,875 --> 00:51:34,225

peanuts dr belong

1536
00:52:15,115 --> 00:52:18,085
i know that it seems like

1537
00:52:19,465 --> 00:52:22,435
that area in the house is maybe

1538
00:52:22,435 --> 00:52:24,925
toxic and dangerous yeah yeah it's i

1539
00:52:24,925 --> 00:52:26,785
mean you know i noticed and it

1540
00:52:26,785 --> 00:52:29,875
seems deep it's incredibly deep i'm just

1541
00:52:29,875 --> 00:52:31,765
worried that i could catch some sort

1542
00:52:31,765 --> 00:52:33,835
of disease yeah i mean it's it's

1543
00:52:33,835 --> 00:52:36,835
fine for most of the house ravenously

1544
00:52:36,835 --> 00:52:38,875
the you know i don't expect it

1545
00:52:38,875 --> 00:52:39,385
to be funny

1546
00:52:39,385 --> 00:52:42,085
hst necessarily but i mean i think

1547
00:52:42,085 --> 00:52:45,385
it should be dealt with i do

1548
00:52:45,595 --> 00:52:48,175
is there anyway to drain it i

1549
00:52:48,175 --> 00:52:50,785
wouldn't do that because i think the

1550
00:52:50,785 --> 00:52:52,825
fuller it gets the more you can

1551
00:52:52,825 --> 00:52:54,325
take advantage of it i'm just worried

1552
00:52:54,325 --> 00:52:55,705
it's going to seep stuff and voters

1553
00:52:55,705 --> 00:52:57,025
get some work to do think maybe

1554
00:52:57,025 --> 00:52:59,425
i can donate it to science yeah

1555
00:52:59,547 --> 00:53:01,735
think i mean that's up to you

1556
00:53:01,825 --> 00:53:04,135
i think you can i think you

1557
00:53:04,135 --> 00:53:06,895
can it's good for tracing circles where

1558
00:53:06,895 --> 00:53:08,155
did it all come from this is

1559
00:53:08,155 --> 00:53:10,255
what i'm pre tracing circles know about

1560
00:53:10,263 --> 00:53:12,265
it means it doesn't know if it's

1561
00:53:12,265 --> 00:53:13,675
not even know what that means tracy

1562
00:53:13,675 --> 00:53:16,615
said well it's a realtor's term oh

1563
00:53:16,645 --> 00:53:18,475
we're not real here i can't there's

1564
00:53:18,475 --> 00:53:19,705
no way i could explain there's

1565
00:53:19,737 --> 00:53:21,745
not a term for it a realty

1566
00:53:21,745 --> 00:53:24,535
circle is like realty bucks so there's

1567
00:53:24,535 --> 00:53:26,245
no way there's no way to describe

1568
00:53:26,245 --> 00:53:28,345
it without talking about it without without

1569
00:53:28,345 --> 00:53:31,525
being a realtor exactly mr mr peanuts

1570
00:53:31,525 --> 00:53:33,655

stem but you but the the the

1573
00:53:37,285 --> 00:53:38,665
you could just put the cover on

1574
00:53:38,665 --> 00:53:39,865
it it has a special cover

1575
00:53:39,925 --> 00:53:42,715
you could put on okay okay you

1576
00:53:42,715 --> 00:53:44,755
see sort of like a waterbed feeling

1577
00:53:44,845 --> 00:53:46,525
at that point maybe we'd forget what

1578
00:53:46,525 --> 00:53:50,425
it was underneath that yes exactly and

1579
00:53:50,455 --> 00:53:52,489
i'm helping you out honestly because i

1580
00:53:52,746 --> 00:53:54,655
i can live like this i mean

1581
00:53:54,655 --> 00:53:56,425
it doesn't if we just never went

1582
00:53:56,425 --> 00:53:57,955
down there it would be fine but

1583
00:53:57,955 --> 00:53:59,575
sure but i would enjoy things down

1584
00:53:59,575 --> 00:53:59,935
there yeah

1585
00:54:00,025 --> 00:54:01,585
eventually we want to you can store

1586
00:54:01,585 --> 00:54:02,125
things

1587
00:54:03,355 --> 00:54:05,785
like what what what what do you

1588
00:54:05,815 --> 00:54:07,465
need storing and i'll tell you if

1589
00:54:07,465 --> 00:54:09,355
you can do it a childhood momentos

1590
00:54:09,415 --> 00:54:11,485
yeah put him in there but they're

1591
00:54:11,485 --> 00:54:13,015
gonna be jimmy ruin they're gonna be

1592
00:54:13,015 --> 00:54:13,795
red and

1593
00:54:15,355 --> 00:54:17,065
and and soaking wet

1594
00:54:18,385 --> 00:54:21,415
red and soaking wet yeah i mean

1595
00:54:21,445 --> 00:54:22,585
i guess i could store my old

1596
00:54:22,585 --> 00:54:25,375
pads down there yeah i guess that

1597
00:54:25,375 --> 00:54:26,792
would be why you keeping your old

1598
00:54:26,792 --> 00:54:28,825
tags well because i like to remember

1599
00:54:29,785 --> 00:54:30,775
do you have your first one i

1600
00:54:30,775 --> 00:54:33,265
sort of just check every month to

1601
00:54:33,265 --> 00:54:34,555
be like and how did that compare

1602
00:54:34,555 --> 00:54:35,935
last month you know and so she's

1603
00:54:35,935 --> 00:54:37,825
like is it ever different i yeah

1604
00:54:38,425 --> 00:54:40,405
really what's the what's the variation on

1605
00:54:40,405 --> 00:54:42,295
it um sometimes to have your flow

1606
00:54:42,415 --> 00:54:44,425
right right i think you can make

1607
00:54:44,425 --> 00:54:46,435
a wonderful wall piece out of those

1608
00:54:47,155 --> 00:54:48,835
like radio station put them in the

1609
00:54:48,985 --> 00:54:50,605

1610
00:54:50,635 --> 00:54:51,625
person i shouldn't put them in the

1611
00:54:51,625 --> 00:54:53,845

that

1615
00:54:58,585 --> 00:55:00,745
