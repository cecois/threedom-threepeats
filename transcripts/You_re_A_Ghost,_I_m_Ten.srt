1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:00,540
three

2
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:08,670
wow

3
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:25,020
oh me yeah oh yeah hey guys

4
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:26,820
i watched american idol the other day

5
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:30,180
the premiere where claudia conway was on

6
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:31,920
oh my god i cannot have

7
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,952
happen with that oh i don't know

8
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,190
by the time this comes out i

9
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:36,420
don't know and i'm not about to

10
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:39,000
watch another episode so but it just

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,680
was it seemed like so much like

12
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:43,380
oh let's get this teen girl who's

13
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:46,560
in this precarious situation to audition for

14
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,700
our show and that'll get a lot

15
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,080
of people to watch it because politics

16
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,580
are so in the news even a

17
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:52,080
singer so she's she's

18
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,880
okay but the the reason i brought

19
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:54,630
it up is because we were all

20
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:56,190
waving our hands when we did that

21
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:57,450
and that is such that is an

22
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:00,390
affectation that i just cannot stand when

23
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:03,060
singers yeah like try to scribble the

24
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:04,680
node in the air you know what

25
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:05,010
i mean

26
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:08,610
it reminds me of when the people

27
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:11,400
that would lead the songs at church

28
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:14,070
um there was this one guy who

29
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:16,410
ah would do it every week and

30
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:18,330
he would try to debut rush

31
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:24,240
yeah he was really charismatic beautiful long

32
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:28,050
curly hair and most mysterious glasses um

33
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:31,830
he would um raise and lower he

34
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:33,450
would you like stick out two fingers

35
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:35,850
and raise and lower them indicate where

36
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:38,790
the notes were going to to guide

37
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:39,360
people or

38
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,310
people are just for himself see the

39
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:42,570
signal no two guy because he was

40
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:45,840
not a dynamic singer right yeah

41
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:49,500
that's that's what i heard about i've

42
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:53,310
destroyed the show right yeah i think

43
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,260

104
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:08,160
when it would be sick too and

00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,560
i would have a cough like you're

106
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:14,010
so hard to describe i would picture

107
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,840
a sort of uh

108
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,560
um like a tube in my in

109
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:20,700
my throat

110
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,660

to get the air like like in

114
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:34,320
order to get the cough to be

115
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:36,990
over this is fucking hard to describe

116
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:38,730
okay i'm gonna try to imagine it

117
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:40,020
like going through the you would have

118
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:42,000
to get over the the curve in

119
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:43,710
the tube right i think you mean

120
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:44,850

121
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,070
cam maybe it was a cane shape

122
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:48,360
yes yeah i would think of it

123
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,010
as right and it's like you're trying

124
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,630

131
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:07,050
the doctor trips every man didn't even

132
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,040
when i was a kid they were

133
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,020
like okay we're giving a running tally

134
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:10,650
of everything you owe

135
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,440
there aren't they're not parents who do

136
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,680
that probably i have a friend who

137
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:19,197
has parent he has like a a

138
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:20,700
sort of dynamic with his parents and

139
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:21,300
money were

140
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:23,850
they'll like give him a loan that

141
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:25,350

142
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:27,479

143
00:05:27,479 --> 00:05:28,770
he didn't really need you anymore but

144
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:30,450
there were periods of time where he

145
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:32,220
would like get a loan from them

146
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:33,752
or they would like buy his car

147
00:05:33,752 --> 00:05:35,280
then or you know he would take

148
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,690
their old car and like pay them

149
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:39,240
off monthly installments yeah and it's like

150
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:42,210
very transactional and like plan like everyone's

151
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:42,480
aware

152
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,310
air of how much is owed right

153
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,450
yeah i don't know i feel like

154
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:47,460
that's i don't know but once you're

155
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:49,830
once you graduate or leave the house

156
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:51,657
yeah i can see that i'm yeah

157
00:05:51,657 --> 00:05:52,980
i'm just saying there i feel like

158
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:56,520
i've read something where some parents tallied

159
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,500
up literally everything they ever spent on

160
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,360
their kid and then gave this sounds

161
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,370
familiar oh so mean like when they

162
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:02,610
turned

163
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,530
eighteen it's like hey here's fifty two

164
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,633
thousand dollars yesterday in the world that's

165
00:06:06,633 --> 00:06:09,210
it's that's beyond it's completely insane like

166
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:10,890
that's what having a kid is yeah

167
00:06:11,552 --> 00:06:13,770
your idea is stupid yeah you liked

168
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:15,600

169
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,970

00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:19,950
in your family yeah yeah that's a

171
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:22,110
lot of kids too many actually just

172
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:22,680
think about this too

173
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,870
cause i have a friend who is

174
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:27,720
having a third child and then i

175
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,950
was we were talking about another friend

176
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:29,730
who has three kids i was like

177
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:30,990
oh she'll probably be excited you are

178
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:32,310
having three kids and she was like

179
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:33,420
she's about ever fourth and i was

180
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:36,030
like there are people having four and

181
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:38,250
five and six it is weird to

182
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:40,110
think about because i i just feel

183
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:42,630
like one would be enough yeah but

184
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:42,870
it's

185
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:46,140
but maybe to six kids like i

186
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:47,790
always thought i'd be the funniest thing

187
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:48,390
in the world when i was a

188
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:50,280

00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,720

still really like that idea but then

195
00:06:58,170 --> 00:06:59,790
as an adult it just sounds like

196
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:01,800
as an adult how do you mean

197
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,090

take care of themselves or something i

200
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:06,990
get i don't know but they don't

201
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:09,390
um i it's honestly more fun as

202
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:10,350
an adult to have a bunch of

203
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:12,690
siblings yeah than i was as a

204
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:14,550
kid why did you feel like you

205
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:17,160
always were fighting with somebody i always

206
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,290
was but it's also because because the

207
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:22,470
were spaced down it's like my sisters

208
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:23,070

209
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:25,200
moving out of the house not like

210
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:28,650
the sisters they were and are doing

211
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:30,840
it for themselves um so they were

212
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:31,950
they were so much older than i

213
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:32,940
was because i was at the other

214
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:35,700
end of the line that we didn't

215
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:38,760
really have that kind of vibe that

216
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,440
you see in the movies or whatever

217
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,120

262
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,610
a friend of graham who had there

263
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:13,290
were five siblings and that really seemed

264
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:15,450
like a lot and but they have

265
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:17,220
like i think their life was very

266
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,440
like creative because they had to find

267
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,210
all these ways to like stand out

268
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:24,210
well no because like just because my

269
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:27,030
shi'i my kids yeah they were all

270
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:28,555
very like the paint their furniture and

271
00:09:28,555 --> 00:09:29,940
i'd be like funky and cool and

272
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:30,090
like

273
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,190
high goals that you know in the

274
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:33,630
fine things in the alley and make

275
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:35,130
it into something where you were you

276
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:37,080
in the suburbs lauren in chicago or

277
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,360
where you you were so yeah was

278
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:40,740
i mean i felt growing up in

279
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:42,840
the suburbs everything just look the same

280
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,010
in every house you know what i

281
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:46,800
mean like everyone just little pink bow

282
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,380
is you and i don't know i

283
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,280
don't know

284
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:52,950
how it compares but i feel like

285
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:56,670
my suburb wasn't fully a suburb like

286
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:59,970
it's ok it's around okay and it's

287
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:03,030
and there's like for example like unique

288
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:05,040
architecture like there's not each house is

289
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,090
different from the last one it's not

290
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:07,830
like there's it's like the brady bunch

291
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:09,570
style or you know like um like

292
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,560
one town over

293
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,630
like much more like every home was

294
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:13,770
built in the sixties and they all

295
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:16,201
the same right but like our town

296
00:10:16,201 --> 00:10:17,520
i like there's older homes and more

297
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:20,190
character so so did everyone sort of

298
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:22,170
it felt like in the suburbs everyone

299
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:24,390
wanted to decorate their houses alike in

300
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:26,250
a way like yeah no i did

301
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:28,560
that did that vibe did but when

302
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,670
you're in the city it's like oh

303
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:31,020
wow this person has this sense of

304
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:31,380
style

305
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,670
yes it is this sense of sight

306
00:10:32,684 --> 00:10:34,020
i think that carried over a bit

307
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:36,210
because most of my friends grew up

308
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:38,190
each house was completely like i had

309
00:10:38,217 --> 00:10:40,530
a friend that really modern house mid-century

310
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:41,880
sort of than there's like the really

311
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,170
like crafty and then there's like a

312
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:46,110
victorian like there's just like different vibes

313
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:51,390
ooh what was your parents decorate huh

314
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:54,090
it's i would say what's hard to

315
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:55,740
like give it a name i guess

316
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:58,110
but i would say like goff cozy

317
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:01,860
um but very decorated like it's it's

318
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:03,840
like each room is like all the

319
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:06,900
choices are made so it's not like

320
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,010
for example i might have mentioned this

321
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:09,420
like i couldn't hang like a poster

322
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:11,730
on my wall really wow

323
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:13,140
oh oh what was the poster going

324
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:14,430
to be i don't know i just

325
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,167
it was never an option really it

326
00:11:16,167 --> 00:11:17,700
was like joe trippi art on the

327
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:20,250
wall that's like framed and then i

328
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:21,480
have like a bulletin board i can

329
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,800
put stuff on the bullets oh i

330
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,810
see but they buddy poster would be

331
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:27,028
out of the decorating style yeah i'd

332
00:11:27,028 --> 00:11:28,770
like to just look like shit like

333
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:30,330
yeah but like i always like would

334
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:31,860
think it was cool my friend's house

335
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:34,140

based on the wall like a big

340
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:42,360
collage

341
00:11:45,122 --> 00:11:47,340
now let's remember i mean other you

342
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:48,690
are doing that but i'm saying like

343
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:49,830

big kids would put absolut ads when

352
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:03,510

a constant topic of discussion i will

422
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:44,790
say that we never wanted for anything

423
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:46,920
like we never went hungry we never

424
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,810

00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,370
the goodwill you know what i mean

426
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,230
but we were not i remember my

427
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:55,770
mother saying saying years later like my

428
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:57,780
children never knew that they were poor

429
00:14:58,290 --> 00:14:59,970
oh that's nice yeah and we'd tell

430
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:02,190
i told them doesn't she every night

431
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:03,990
when they went to see your poor

432
00:15:05,490 --> 00:15:07,080
i wish we were probably like lower

433
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:09,210
middle class that's how i feel you

434
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:11,010
feel like you didn't know and did

435
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:12,540
you feel like you know i never

436
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:15,840
i never felt like i they never

437
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:17,610
they would my mother would make us

438
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:20,220
keenly aware of how much shit costs

439
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,020
and what we could not afford like

440
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:24,270
frivolous things that were we were off

441
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:24,900
the table

442
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:27,270
but there was there was never a

443
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:29,400
she never gave us any panic about

444
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,470
it she never gave us any indication

445
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:32,700
my dad was laid off at one

448
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:38,880
that it was a big deal because

449
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,890
they hid that stuff from us very

450
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:43,410
artfully interesting yeah because they didn't want

451
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:45,240
you to worry yeah i

452
00:15:45,412 --> 00:15:46,710

like

567
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:27,300
a thousand dollars for something like a

568
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:28,260

00:20:21,435 --> 00:20:23,565
and i would go i would save

587
00:20:23,565 --> 00:20:25,515

for a long time she sold some

629
00:21:54,587 --> 00:21:55,984
because they were starting to become worth

630
00:21:56,055 --> 00:21:58,935
hundreds each like well also they're probably

631
00:21:58,935 --> 00:22:00,862
not worth that much anymore no peak

632
00:22:01,125 --> 00:22:03,285
she was definitely crazy inventive real babies

633
00:22:04,005 --> 00:22:05,505

634
00:22:05,955 --> 00:22:08,085

listener who knows like your site there

755
00:26:21,225 --> 00:26:23,625

00:26:23,625 --> 00:26:25,095
price of five to seven dollars in

757
00:26:25,095 --> 00:26:27,525

diana princess of wales memorial fund today

759
00:26:29,985 --> 00:26:31,035
the going rate is as low as

760
00:26:31,035 --> 00:26:32,295
two dollars or

761
00:26:32,295 --> 00:26:33,675

762
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:35,295

bears at upwards of sixty five thousand

766
00:26:42,285 --> 00:26:45,225
there's little evidence that any five thousand

767
00:26:45,255 --> 00:26:47,985
little evidence that any of soul wow

768
00:26:48,015 --> 00:26:50,055
that's crucial i love it they asked

769
00:26:50,055 --> 00:26:51,945
for this gigantic amount and then say

770
00:26:51,975 --> 00:26:52,395

louis city

811
00:28:49,755 --> 00:28:50,895
it does make me sad when i

812
00:28:50,925 --> 00:28:52,845
think about people collecting things in a

813
00:28:52,845 --> 00:28:54,585
way and i'm someone who collects stuff

814
00:28:54,585 --> 00:28:55,905
but i collect stuff for pleasure i

815
00:28:55,905 --> 00:28:56,595
don't collect it

816
00:28:57,945 --> 00:28:59,865
for just sell it to sell it

817
00:28:59,865 --> 00:29:01,485
but i don't know any collection is

818
00:29:01,485 --> 00:29:03,897
kind of a form of insanity like

819
00:29:04,155 --> 00:29:06,375
collections i've collected things and then gotten

820
00:29:06,375 --> 00:29:09,255
sick of collecting them yeah because it

821
00:29:09,255 --> 00:29:11,055
does it does take up space and

822
00:29:11,055 --> 00:29:12,855
it's like i don't want these i

823
00:29:12,855 --> 00:29:14,955
don't know i go through periods where

824
00:29:15,345 --> 00:29:17,895
i will accrue things that for

825
00:29:17,895 --> 00:29:19,845
for some reason i feel like a

826
00:29:19,845 --> 00:29:22,095
sense of completion about them yeah and

827
00:29:22,095 --> 00:29:23,535
then i realised i don't care that

828
00:29:23,535 --> 00:29:26,415
much like this is just taking up

829
00:29:26,415 --> 00:29:28,545
space in my home know i collect

830
00:29:28,545 --> 00:29:30,765
miniatures and i'm now really wanting a

831
00:29:30,765 --> 00:29:32,565
really good way to display them and

832
00:29:32,565 --> 00:29:33,645
i want it to be like ah

833
00:29:33,825 --> 00:29:35,565
a lot of like a huge wall

834
00:29:35,565 --> 00:29:38,025

835
00:29:38,055 --> 00:29:39,195

that we hired a guy to do

930
00:32:45,925 --> 00:32:47,665
like a task rabbit thing because we're

931
00:32:47,665 --> 00:32:49,855

like csi real rabbit yeah scott i

935
00:32:56,755 --> 00:32:59,125
don't wanna spoil it um so we

936
00:32:59,125 --> 00:33:00,325
got this guy we wanted to have

937
00:33:00,325 --> 00:33:02,845
all these all these photos on this

938
00:33:02,845 --> 00:33:03,685
one wall

939
00:33:04,705 --> 00:33:07,588
and i told the guy like yeah

940
00:33:07,588 --> 00:33:09,025
they if you space them out like

941
00:33:09,025 --> 00:33:12,055
ah an inch between the photos whatever

942
00:33:12,055 --> 00:33:15,445
inch between the ideal was between

943
00:33:17,155 --> 00:33:19,795
the idea was in our minds we

944
00:33:19,795 --> 00:33:22,289
would keep adding pictures to this yeah

945
00:33:22,345 --> 00:33:24,715
once we got like the middles the

946
00:33:24,715 --> 00:33:26,635
base we would on the outer edges

947
00:33:26,636 --> 00:33:29,365
we'd seen and even easier to do

948
00:33:29,365 --> 00:33:30,595
because then you have like the the

949
00:33:30,745 --> 00:33:32,575
guy and so kind of yes yes

950
00:33:32,815 --> 00:33:34,615
well this guy filled the entire wall

951
00:33:34,675 --> 00:33:36,655
will be the the orpik pilot

952
00:33:36,985 --> 00:33:37,975
it's like just a battle

953
00:33:39,265 --> 00:33:41,310
a little initiative any get it i

954
00:33:41,356 --> 00:33:43,645
understand i don't know why but guidelines

955
00:33:43,645 --> 00:33:45,355
make that answered my question because yeah

956
00:33:45,775 --> 00:33:49,105
i thought about taskrabbit um i'm i'm

957
00:33:49,105 --> 00:33:51,925
having the geek squad of mount my

958
00:33:51,925 --> 00:33:55,555
tv shore and i was thinking first

959
00:33:55,555 --> 00:33:57,175
about taskrabbit because i know people who've

960
00:33:57,175 --> 00:33:58,975
done that but i'm like isn't a

961
00:33:58,975 --> 00:33:59,335
task

962
00:33:59,366 --> 00:34:01,765
but just likes someone who is random

963
00:34:01,765 --> 00:34:04,135
like they don't necessarily know how to

964
00:34:04,135 --> 00:34:06,595
do the thing like i'm right you

965
00:34:06,595 --> 00:34:08,005

00:34:08,995 --> 00:34:10,525
they do they say like i'm really

968
00:34:10,525 --> 00:34:12,235
good at this this this this order

969
00:34:12,235 --> 00:34:13,045

970
00:34:13,045 --> 00:34:14,785

971
00:34:14,815 --> 00:34:16,915

joy to sing it again because it's

990
00:35:04,405 --> 00:35:05,935
in my mind a law i think

991
00:35:05,935 --> 00:35:07,165
whenever i hear the word knife i

992
00:35:07,165 --> 00:35:08,365

995
00:35:12,955 --> 00:35:14,845

996
00:35:14,845 --> 00:35:16,285
at the like back when we could

997
00:35:16,285 --> 00:35:18,025

1006
00:35:31,045 --> 00:35:33,055

metal triangle on top of the big

1017
00:36:01,671 --> 00:36:04,285

usually would use a comb but i

1075
00:38:09,175 --> 00:38:11,335
stopped because i was told that with

1076
00:38:11,335 --> 00:38:14,635
my hair texture that's worse because they

1077
00:38:14,635 --> 00:38:16,225

1078
00:38:16,225 --> 00:38:19,165
wavy hair like makes it laying flatter

1079
00:38:19,165 --> 00:38:21,175
if i comb it and if i

1080
00:38:21,205 --> 00:38:22,885
just let it air-dry without combing it

1081
00:38:22,885 --> 00:38:23,995
and puts i just put little stuff

1082
00:38:23,995 --> 00:38:25,135
and let it air-dry that it's more

1083
00:38:25,135 --> 00:38:25,285
weight

1084
00:38:25,285 --> 00:38:28,465
even with more volume okay so there

1085
00:38:28,465 --> 00:38:29,635
you have anyone out there with wavy

1086
00:38:29,635 --> 00:38:31,555
hair has been combing and feeling like

00:38:31,555 --> 00:38:32,515
you get to hear a little doll

1088
00:38:33,055 --> 00:38:34,675

he could figure out how to open

1239
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:43,080
it yeah so i remember one day

like working in the warehouse and ah

1472
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:23,940

1473
00:51:23,940 --> 00:51:25,470
ah and a literal warehouse where i

1474
00:51:25,470 --> 00:51:27,630
moved stuff for a living but that

1475
00:51:27,630 --> 00:51:29,640
sounds weird and disneyland oh i have

1476
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:31,800
a question yes where do you think

1477
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:33,120
all the stuff at amoeba records went

1478
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:35,220
well they have a new store oh

1479
00:51:35,220 --> 00:51:36,330
they do go to new

1480
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:38,730
store yeah oh that's less sad than

1481
00:51:38,730 --> 00:51:40,950
it seemed yeah they they it's it's

1482
00:51:40,950 --> 00:51:42,690
a little bit it seems yeah it's

1483
00:51:42,690 --> 00:51:43,890
a little smaller but it's across the

1484
00:51:43,890 --> 00:51:45,870
street from ah so it is sad

1485
00:51:46,471 --> 00:51:47,760
like everyone was a jew i mean

1486
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:48,780
i think it is sad that they

1487
00:51:48,780 --> 00:51:50,370
shut down the main location which was

1488
00:51:50,370 --> 00:51:53,580
so historic but yeah so now it's

1489
00:51:53,580 --> 00:51:55,800
just some regular little store no it's

1490
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:56,490
not little it's

1491
00:51:56,490 --> 00:51:58,382
still is big but it's across from

1492
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:00,210
shake shack that must have been a

1493
00:52:00,210 --> 00:52:01,230
pain in the ass to move all

1494
00:52:01,230 --> 00:52:02,730
that shit oh and the check check

1495
00:52:02,730 --> 00:52:04,800

opened that on sunset right there looking

1499
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:11,670
for the ways wherein said yes location

1500
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:13,080
is not historic what i'm gonna get

1501
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:15,090
that only home that sounds good then

1502
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:16,590
that location used to be a party

1503
00:52:16,950 --> 00:52:19,440
yeah for the cinerama dome that we

1504
00:52:19,470 --> 00:52:21,090
we used to remember anytime we would

1505
00:52:21,090 --> 00:52:22,140
go to them why was everyone so

1506
00:52:22,140 --> 00:52:23,580
fucking sad about it because it's a

1507
00:52:23,580 --> 00:52:25,440
cool building and that's how music people

1508
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:27,060
get that sounds like a little too

1509
00:52:27,060 --> 00:52:28,710
much remember anytime we would go to

1510
00:52:28,710 --> 00:52:30,900
the center radome we would try to

1511
00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:32,970
park there without paying the what was

1512
00:52:32,970 --> 00:52:35,790
it three dollars think so yeah because

1513
00:52:35,790 --> 00:52:36,720
i was we were all

1514
00:52:36,810 --> 00:52:38,368
oh yeah and it was like and

1515
00:52:38,368 --> 00:52:40,320
they had it it was a giant

1516
00:52:40,350 --> 00:52:42,000
parking lot honestly when you're broke like

1517
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:43,320
that kind of thing is the worst

1518
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:44,280
thing to spend money on like it's

1519
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:46,770
so annoying thing yeah yeah you'd rather

1520
00:52:46,770 --> 00:52:49,050
buy popcorn or something like homeless pets

1521
00:52:49,050 --> 00:52:50,400
away it was a parking lot tow

1522
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:51,750
wet and then they built that one

1523
00:52:52,020 --> 00:52:53,190
i remember when it was built i

1524
00:52:53,190 --> 00:52:54,660
can't remember what year but it was

1525
00:52:54,690 --> 00:52:56,160
it's not that old but the ninety

1526
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:56,884
s two thousand

1527
00:52:57,090 --> 00:52:59,520
two because the first amoeba was where

1528
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:01,590
in in san francisco and yeah that

1529
00:53:01,590 --> 00:53:02,970
sounds i think that's right and that's

1530
00:53:02,970 --> 00:53:04,919
probably more historic but yeah there are

1531
00:53:04,919 --> 00:53:07,230
tower records locations that are way more

1532
00:53:07,230 --> 00:53:10,410
historic amoeba i mean it just doesn't

1533
00:53:10,410 --> 00:53:12,720

so much that was a place that

1549
00:53:41,130 --> 00:53:43,020
i wasn't that interested in going until

1550
00:53:43,020 --> 00:53:45,300
i would say like probably over the

1551
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:47,250
last ten years i started thinking about

1552
00:53:47,250 --> 00:53:48,630
it more and more i never wanted

1553
00:53:48,630 --> 00:53:49,830
to go and yeah it never crossed

1554
00:53:49,830 --> 00:53:50,700
my mind i was like i think

1555
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:52,050
i want to do and when mike

1556
00:53:52,050 --> 00:53:53,280
and i first started dating that was

1557
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:54,510
like he was like we should go

1558
00:53:54,510 --> 00:53:55,620
on a trip somewhere we both have

1559
00:53:55,620 --> 00:53:57,420
never been and that's why we

1560
00:53:57,480 --> 00:53:58,551
chose that do you know when i

1561
00:53:58,551 --> 00:54:00,090
realised it was it was that i

1562
00:54:00,090 --> 00:54:01,140
think i had it in the back

1563
00:54:01,140 --> 00:54:02,220
of my mind it was the fear

1564
00:54:02,220 --> 00:54:04,050
of going some place where i couldn't

1565
00:54:04,050 --> 00:54:06,540
speak the language yeah and then it

1566
00:54:06,540 --> 00:54:07,800
easy for either yeah that's what i've

1567
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:09,090
heard and then but then after i

1568
00:54:09,090 --> 00:54:13,666
went to ah france ah that i

1569
00:54:13,710 --> 00:54:14,850
realised oh it's not the end of

1570
00:54:14,850 --> 00:54:16,260
the world like yeah you can get

1571
00:54:16,260 --> 00:54:17,460
plenty of people here don't know what's

1572
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:17,610
going

1573
00:54:17,610 --> 00:54:20,220
ing on yeah la sect also within

1574
00:54:20,220 --> 00:54:21,660

it should be a pillow too it

1579
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:31,260

1580
00:54:31,260 --> 00:54:33,090

france because in france you like you

translation app and you can like look

1593
00:55:00,270 --> 00:55:02,130
up stuff on menus and and the

1594
00:55:02,130 --> 00:55:03,600
waiters will usually work with you and

1595
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:04,710
all like as if they're not snooty

1596
00:55:04,710 --> 00:55:06,120
at all when we have written french

1597
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:07,710
food so i know of course yeah

1598
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:09,120
for guys

1599
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:10,890
but

1600
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:13,740
for eisenberg i like giotto or the

1601
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:16,947
fine fine and fluffy is um but

1602
00:55:16,947 --> 00:55:19,710
with the paul pie but in tokyo

1603
00:55:19,710 --> 00:55:22,500
especially like the subway system they and

1604
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:23,490
i was saying god it would be

1605
00:55:23,490 --> 00:55:24,990
so how great would it be if

1606
00:55:24,990 --> 00:55:27,810
the subway system here in america we're

1607
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:30,090
as inclusive as it is there where

1608
00:55:30,090 --> 00:55:31,872
it's like they're trying to make sure

1609
00:55:32,460 --> 00:55:34,680
that english tourists are very well taken

1610
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:36,270
care of and like they they shove

1611
00:55:36,273 --> 00:55:37,770
them in the subway with a stick

1612
00:55:38,010 --> 00:55:40,770
they well we never went during during

1613
00:55:40,770 --> 00:55:43,800
those times which just seems crazy to

1614
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:46,470
me it's yeah yard bar if you

1615
00:55:46,530 --> 00:55:48,180
if the listeners haven't don't know what

1616
00:55:48,180 --> 00:55:51,450
we're talking about during rush hour there's

1617
00:55:51,450 --> 00:55:52,290
videos yeah there's

1618
00:55:52,410 --> 00:55:54,840
audio's it's amazing crazy like so many

1619
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:56,160
people are taking the subways that they

1620
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:59,070
literally have they hire people to push

1621
00:55:59,070 --> 00:56:01,560
them into the subway to smash them

1622
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:03,120
in we have to assume they're doing

1623
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:05,190
that with covert around now so they

1624
00:56:05,190 --> 00:56:06,510
might not be the stick people are

1625
00:56:06,510 --> 00:56:08,610
out of work oh that's the big

1626
00:56:08,910 --> 00:56:11,072
tragedy with covert maybe they're keeping people

1627
00:56:11,072 --> 00:56:12,570
a par with the stick yeah

1628
00:56:12,823 --> 00:56:14,280
the amount of work they had to

1629
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:15,090
learn a new skill

1630
00:56:16,290 --> 00:56:17,160
alright we have to take a break

1631
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:17,760

1635
00:56:25,290 --> 00:56:29,250
rare three-tier correction we we did this

1636
00:56:29,250 --> 00:56:31,410
one terribly the first time we didn't

1637
00:56:31,410 --> 00:56:33,690
know this this was submitted by matilda

1638
00:56:33,780 --> 00:56:37,350
g and um one person thinks of

1639
00:56:37,350 --> 00:56:38,970
a criteria or theme

1640
00:56:38,970 --> 00:56:41,940
or category of things that their guests

1641
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:44,220
can bring to the picnic okay examples

1642
00:56:44,220 --> 00:56:45,448
are things that are blue things that

1643
00:56:45,448 --> 00:56:48,750
start with a round-shaped things etc then

1644
00:56:48,750 --> 00:56:49,980
the guests start asking if they can
