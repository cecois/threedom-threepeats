97
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:23,280
needed to bring with me ah for

98
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,380
the show and then guess what i

99
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:26,460
didn't look at that list and i

100
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:27,720
got in the car yeah and i

101
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:28,650
was about to pull away and i

102
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:29,910
was like i remembered one of the

103
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:31,860
things i i was i got cocky

104
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:32,852
and i was like i remembered all

105
00:03:32,852 --> 00:03:34,734
the i got all yes yeah

106
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,210
you can't you can't do that no

107
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,800
one but it's like what's the why

108
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:39,270
did i make that list if i

109
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:40,920
wasn't going to look at it for

110
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,600
exactly that reasons like right before you

111
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,830
leave out look at that list so

112
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:45,270
this used to be so important when

113
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:47,250
you like all the years life that

114
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:49,200
we were this is putting on like

115
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:50,880
shows the hbo workspace and all that

116
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,190
comes yeah making the list of every

117
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:54,960
prop you have and every single thing

118
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,180
and he was so important i remember

119
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:00,570
a particular performance where someone i was

120
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:03,120
performing with did not bring a huge

121
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,350
thing on the list and he was

122
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:05,580
just like well this is why we

123
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:08,370
make the lags um drive us is

124
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,350
why we make it drag them to

125
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:10,860
fill

126
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:18,300
so the memes are no more oh

127
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,800
i knew we'd get to it we

128
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,840
have to mention it because we didn't

129
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,400
know that obviously when we were recording

130
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,200

one actually started watching basketball

196
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,540

would talk about it they're never gonna

198
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,960
let i'm missing though by not rolling

199
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:30,030
policy sport twitter because i think if

200
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:30,930
i was on twitter i would have

201
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:32,310
seen everyone but the lion here the

202
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:34,950
super bowl you stupid and i would

203
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:35,730
understood

204
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,860
and you know no i just think

205
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:39,630
i think this was like oh people

206
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:40,830
are talking about the memes thing we

207
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:42,750
have this big campaign with maya rudolph

208
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:45,360
coming up let's make a big thing

209
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,460
out of it um and instead it's

210
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:49,050
like this weird backlash where people are

211
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:51,210
taking series we will see because i'm

212
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:54,330
seeing a lotta articles about it's weird

213
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:56,250
that people are invested but i guess

214
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:56,880
they are like when you

215
00:06:56,910 --> 00:06:58,740
don't care about a thing yeah it's

216
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:01,140
impossible to believe that somebody does something

217
00:07:01,227 --> 00:07:03,660
stupid yes i find it weird okay

218
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:05,460
here's something i've been noticing turn me

219
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:07,140
up at my headphones actually don't i

220
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:08,580
just turn myself up yeah you have

221
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:10,020
to do it yourself it's right next

222
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:10,230
to you

223
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:13,020
um but what i find what i

224
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:15,060
find very strange is like that there

225
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:18,150
are fans of things like scooby-doo who

226
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:21,090
are so protective of it that they

227
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:22,680
hate like versions of it like a

228
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,600
new velma vs exact cool op sun

229
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:27,450
like there's so much hate for apps

230
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:29,130
on it yes she doesn't she's working

231
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:31,440
she might as well spit and squeeze

232
00:07:31,479 --> 00:07:33,479
face that's awesome what's it called of

233
00:07:33,479 --> 00:07:35,310
the elbow oh great and it's just

234
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:38,550
like it's not the official scooby-doo movie

235
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:40,770
or anything like you know how used

236
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:42,480
to when the superman movie came out

237
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,260
i was like oh yeah hope it's

238
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:44,220
good i hope it's good and that

239
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:45,540
turns out to be good yeah but

240
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:47,760
it's just another random like scooby doo

241
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:49,950
show of of eight million scooby-doo yeah

242
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:51,570
licensed properties that will be

243
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,310
out there yeah eventually you know like

244
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:54,900
why get so upset about look i

245
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:58,170
defended the imams last week and i

246
00:07:58,170 --> 00:07:59,820
stand by that i hope that it

247
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:00,570
comes hoping you would

248
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,940
help the company you're going to show

249
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,428
up and i hope they all do

250
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,240
dance i think they will do this

251
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,920
and i hope it's toronto i really

252
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,420
hope it what if what if it

253
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:11,670
comes out and no they're never mentioned

254
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:13,710
again in my rudolph like eats them

255
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:15,150
at the beginning of the commercials like

256
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:16,560
they're dead now and then i just

257
00:08:16,563 --> 00:08:17,970
bored for the actually that's funny and

258
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:19,410
i think i think it's alert when

259
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:20,550
i read that they were going to

260
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:21,810
replace them i felt

261
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,040
bad for the people who had just

262
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,770
gotten those jobs as the mascots but

263
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,970
i liked the idea

264
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:29,370
amber ruffin

265
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,060
see another introduce the character and then

266
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:35,130
a week later they're like we can't

267
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:37,650
do it yeah everybody's mad yeah and

268
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:39,480
then we have to appease these pen

269
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,310
then i thought who are filled with

270
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:45,750
a yeah but i thought my doing

271
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,370
like a candy commercial is actually really

272
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:49,170
refreshing and there's something sort of throwback

273
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:50,610
yeah so just holding a bag of

274
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:51,900
my name is something shows up the

275
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:54,390
commercial for yet it is refreshing i

276
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:55,971
like i like the m and a

277
00:08:55,971 --> 00:08:57,660
a candy commercial where someone just holds

278
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:59,760
the bag and they're like yum and

279
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,960
then they eat it and then they

280
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,280
eat it yeah that's all we need

281
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:04,260
why are we spending millions of dollars

282
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:05,910
on these super bowl commercials yeah

283
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:09,090

that makes you a sick individual look

296
00:09:32,191 --> 00:09:33,450
i don't know we just helped hype

297
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:35,130
up the commercial and i know i

298
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:37,020
know sorry we're talking about mgm's again

299
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:38,790
we've already done the taste test i

300
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:40,620
didn't leave their commercials on this book

301
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:43,290
we had a symbiotic early beta shell

302
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:44,910
and help m and m's grow their

303
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:47,100
power i just thought it was a

304
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:48,900
topical thing and i guess it's not

305
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:49,200
dope

306
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,780
do other candy companies make mgm's they

307
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:53,438
just call them something different yes yes

308
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:55,200
absolutely are not as good by the

309
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,210
way why should they be as good

310
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:58,590
okay you know what should wait do

311
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:00,270
you know what is really good wow

312
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,639
but they're expensive but they're they're a

313
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:06,180
sort of caviar healthier note vote yeah

314
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,700
it's like a healthier alternative to an

315
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:09,390
eminem i guess

316
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:12,560

a shell it's essentially a peanut menachem

319
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:20,810
and it's really fucking good although i

320
00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:22,760

the bad things what you should eat

344
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:17,330
instead i mean sometimes it's kind of

345
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:19,220
like okay okay and other times you're

346
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,540
like oh that's good to know okay

347
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:21,796
so i had pizza last night what

348
00:11:21,796 --> 00:11:23,330
should i've had it's not a salad

349
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:24,980
it's really yeah it's not like that

350
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:25,370
it's more like

351
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:27,710
like this if everything they just go

352
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:30,770
salad if you're buying a apple this

353
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:33,410
granola you should know that it has

354
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,830
these ingredients that are actually really synthetic

355
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:38,720
and bad you should buy this brand

356
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,460
because it's all natural or whatever and

357
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:42,380
so i'm like you know taking a

358
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:43,640
lot of that in right now it

359
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,230
is true you cannot take

360
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,960
a you know you can't take at

361
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:50,810
face value of a package that says

362
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:52,521
this is all natural and healthy and

363
00:11:52,521 --> 00:11:53,660
shit which is so crazy that i

364
00:11:53,666 --> 00:11:55,790
could literally say all naturalists absolutely yeah

365
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:58,550
it's like yes um but i remember

366
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:01,430
i used to think that trader joe's

367
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:03,181
was somehow help helping i see i

368
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,480

458
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,910
for all the recycling so i need

459
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:06,590
the session basically it's just two touchdowns

460
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:07,850
yeah

461
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:09,770
just giving you a task sorting out

462
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:12,740
for fine but it's it it also

463
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,600
with the gases right now that all

464
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:16,670
i'm posting is a house's composting will

465
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:18,590
help a lot but it's you also

466
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:19,760
have to teach everyone how to do

467
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,050
it you can't just say no by

468
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:22,940
the way you pose here's here i

469
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:24,740
should not say composting although some people

470
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:26,060
in my neighbourhood have started doing that

471
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:26,750
we have to put it in a

472
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:28,010
separate bin we have to pay

473
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,360

00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,969
which is where like the mannings yeah

475
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:33,590
eaves and shit and so but then

476
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:35,630
that means that you have to get

477
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:38,300
another little trash can in your house

478
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:40,100

you can't think about that kind of

614
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:06,710
stuff yeah sometimes you can't but sometimes

615
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:09,470

616
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:12,560

run with prompts but nothing does unfortunately

641
00:21:19,795 --> 00:21:20,575
prompts

642
00:21:22,135 --> 00:21:26,305
pump see clumps clean i mean drops

643
00:21:26,365 --> 00:21:28,945
ghazal yeah examples

644
00:21:30,385 --> 00:21:33,805
okay pause prompts there what is this

645
00:21:33,849 --> 00:21:35,305
how do we play or it's not

646
00:21:35,305 --> 00:21:37,015
a game yeah it's just you talking

647
00:21:37,315 --> 00:21:40,285
okay it's me and you like good

648
00:21:40,285 --> 00:21:44,995
day it's this is me saying something

649
00:21:45,265 --> 00:21:48,905
that will prompt conversation hey i love

650
00:21:48,925 --> 00:21:50,305
hey he'll tear it though

651
00:21:50,305 --> 00:21:53,335
there is an intersection that i have

652
00:21:53,335 --> 00:21:55,975
to go through almost every day intersectional

653
00:21:56,005 --> 00:22:00,595
it's a very broad intersection and it's

654
00:22:00,685 --> 00:22:03,595
unpleasant because it's like it's too wide

655
00:22:03,625 --> 00:22:05,635
and you feel like there can be

656
00:22:05,665 --> 00:22:07,045
there's the potential for an axis four

657
00:22:07,045 --> 00:22:09,171
way stop it's too wide you you

658
00:22:09,235 --> 00:22:10,465
preferred to be a little more

659
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:11,425
narrow to get in there

660
00:22:12,715 --> 00:22:18,055
okay so ah pretty much oh you

661
00:22:18,055 --> 00:22:20,725
know it's the it's the rule of

662
00:22:21,025 --> 00:22:22,373
okay you get here before me didn't

663
00:22:22,373 --> 00:22:24,505
you go wait is the issue here

664
00:22:24,505 --> 00:22:26,575
more than more than four way stop

665
00:22:26,605 --> 00:22:28,615
or it's just too it's it's too

666
00:22:28,615 --> 00:22:30,235
wide it's four-way stop but but how

667
00:22:30,235 --> 00:22:32,785
many lanes just single lanes

668
00:22:32,785 --> 00:22:34,763
a single lane yeah yeah yeah but

669
00:22:34,763 --> 00:22:36,355
it but the cars are so far

670
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:39,035
away you can't tell who got it

671
00:22:39,085 --> 00:22:40,675
and how to know you can but

672
00:22:40,675 --> 00:22:42,835
it's like it's so wide that some

673
00:22:42,835 --> 00:22:46,465
people might be it's just like people

674
00:22:46,495 --> 00:22:49,615
are not sure who goes when okay

675
00:22:49,615 --> 00:22:52,195
it seems hey so one time i'm

676
00:22:52,195 --> 00:22:52,885
at this

677
00:22:53,575 --> 00:22:55,645
this four way stop and it's my

678
00:22:55,645 --> 00:22:56,965
turn i know that it's like you

679
00:22:56,995 --> 00:22:59,275
know what you and i start going

680
00:22:59,275 --> 00:23:01,945
into the intersection in this woman coming

681
00:23:01,945 --> 00:23:06,625
from the ah perpendicular yeah either the

682
00:23:06,625 --> 00:23:07,525
left or the right of you

683
00:23:09,265 --> 00:23:11,215
she's coming through she starts coming to

684
00:23:11,215 --> 00:23:12,775
and then she honks at me right

685
00:23:12,865 --> 00:23:14,035
and i stop and then she goes

686
00:23:14,035 --> 00:23:15,385
through and she's like cursing at me

687
00:23:15,385 --> 00:23:17,455
through the window yeah and i dry

688
00:23:17,515 --> 00:23:19,975
wishy like like the curse and thinner

689
00:23:20,035 --> 00:23:21,355
or anything no she couldn't touch my

690
00:23:21,355 --> 00:23:22,225
face okay

691
00:23:23,455 --> 00:23:26,725
and so lucky i drive on and

692
00:23:26,725 --> 00:23:29,395
i'm like that sucked and when i

693
00:23:29,395 --> 00:23:30,715
get to my destination i have a

694
00:23:30,715 --> 00:23:33,265
text from my friend todd cooper yeah

695
00:23:33,325 --> 00:23:34,075
who says

696
00:23:35,275 --> 00:23:37,379
by the way you were right oh

697
00:23:37,379 --> 00:23:38,935
and lady that lady was wrong he

698
00:23:38,935 --> 00:23:41,335
saw you you had to write whoa

699
00:23:41,351 --> 00:23:43,015
he saw and it was first it

700
00:23:43,015 --> 00:23:45,775
was very valid oh nice guy but

701
00:23:45,775 --> 00:23:48,265
now i'd never think of that every

702
00:23:48,265 --> 00:23:51,115
time i go through that intersect you

703
00:23:51,115 --> 00:23:52,495
think of the texture you think of

704
00:23:52,495 --> 00:23:53,905
the i think of golden i think

705
00:23:53,905 --> 00:23:55,345
the whole you think of every test

706
00:23:55,825 --> 00:23:56,935
and so your question i think of

707
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:58,525
everything everywhere all at once yeah i

708
00:23:58,525 --> 00:24:00,565
just watched that do you have a

709
00:24:00,625 --> 00:24:02,995
is there is there a location that

710
00:24:02,995 --> 00:24:05,515
you that you have to frequently be

711
00:24:05,515 --> 00:24:08,215
at that prompts a memory you know

712
00:24:08,425 --> 00:24:10,315
time you get it happened so much

713
00:24:10,315 --> 00:24:11,605
wait let me think i have to

714
00:24:11,605 --> 00:24:12,805
think of one but i do feel

715
00:24:12,805 --> 00:24:14,065
like my brain does that a lot

716
00:24:14,155 --> 00:24:15,505
yeah why yeah

717
00:24:15,535 --> 00:24:17,185
i think that every time or you

718
00:24:17,185 --> 00:24:18,115
know what i think i once you

719
00:24:18,139 --> 00:24:19,875
become conscious of it then it's cemented

720
00:24:19,931 --> 00:24:21,775
you know whatever sometimes what i'll think

721
00:24:21,775 --> 00:24:23,995
of is what podcast i was listening

722
00:24:23,995 --> 00:24:25,555
to when i was in this area

723
00:24:25,795 --> 00:24:27,115
like i will remember part of a

724
00:24:27,115 --> 00:24:29,695
podcast connected to i was driving here

725
00:24:29,695 --> 00:24:30,597
and i was listening to that and

726
00:24:30,597 --> 00:24:31,525
then that was what they said is

727
00:24:31,525 --> 00:24:33,175
right here right and it's like that's

728
00:24:33,175 --> 00:24:35,515
not anything it's completely worthless

729
00:24:35,935 --> 00:24:37,285
um i don't know do you have

730
00:24:37,285 --> 00:24:38,095
one on top of your head i

731
00:24:38,095 --> 00:24:39,145
mean i've had some and i know

732
00:24:39,145 --> 00:24:40,135

733
00:24:40,135 --> 00:24:41,665
already so i've had stuff like that

734
00:24:41,815 --> 00:24:43,735
things like this go into carl's junior

735
00:24:43,735 --> 00:24:46,435
and remembering the time that i someone

736
00:24:46,435 --> 00:24:48,595
was offering me like all the leftover

737
00:24:48,595 --> 00:24:49,825
fries that were in the

738
00:24:51,115 --> 00:24:53,005
in the fryer because they were closing

739
00:24:53,005 --> 00:24:54,025
and i thought he was trying to

740
00:24:54,025 --> 00:24:55,165
say like hey would you rather have

741
00:24:55,165 --> 00:24:56,665
these fries to replace your fries i

742
00:24:56,665 --> 00:24:58,045
was like yeah these are actually kind

743
00:24:58,045 --> 00:24:59,605
of cold and he was trying to

744
00:24:59,755 --> 00:25:02,065
be nice and i said these are

745
00:25:02,065 --> 00:25:03,878
called and so anytime i go into

746
00:25:03,925 --> 00:25:05,815
cross like about okay but that's also

747
00:25:05,815 --> 00:25:08,635
like um random girls remembering any crows

748
00:25:08,635 --> 00:25:11,095
during mis step that you made

749
00:25:11,185 --> 00:25:12,505
i have like those like haunt me

750
00:25:12,505 --> 00:25:14,245
differently i think this is yes this

751
00:25:14,245 --> 00:25:16,555
is remembering something good this year i

752
00:25:16,555 --> 00:25:18,325
didn't knock you were someone curse it

753
00:25:18,325 --> 00:25:21,265
doesn't matter that there that it happened

754
00:25:22,075 --> 00:25:23,755
at all i thought i was doing

755
00:25:23,755 --> 00:25:25,585
good and answering your question but now

756
00:25:25,585 --> 00:25:26,935
you've told me i was bad i

757
00:25:26,935 --> 00:25:28,705
think you're great i'm just following them

758
00:25:28,705 --> 00:25:31,135
to trust i know why am i

759
00:25:31,135 --> 00:25:31,345
in

760
00:25:31,525 --> 00:25:33,745
trouble i don't understand i'm following the

761
00:25:33,775 --> 00:25:36,145
prompt and i'm trying to parcel out

762
00:25:36,145 --> 00:25:38,125
what the prompt is asking and i

763
00:25:38,125 --> 00:25:40,375
feel like you're off base so i'm

764
00:25:40,375 --> 00:25:43,435
wrong okay alright well noted by the

765
00:25:43,435 --> 00:25:45,655
segment was a flop well no either

766
00:25:45,677 --> 00:25:47,425
a segment why do i try oh

767
00:25:47,425 --> 00:25:48,528
no no no no no no no

768
00:25:48,528 --> 00:25:49,585
no i'll never have a segment on

769
00:25:49,585 --> 00:25:51,115
this whenever i hear pulse prompts again

770
00:25:51,115 --> 00:25:51,475
i think of

771
00:25:51,505 --> 00:25:53,310
this you're never going to hurt it

772
00:25:54,685 --> 00:25:56,155
the only time it's ever gonna are

773
00:25:56,155 --> 00:25:58,255
you trying to forget this stuff though

774
00:25:58,285 --> 00:25:59,515
are you trying to i don't care

775
00:25:59,545 --> 00:26:00,895
because you go through this intersection a

776
00:26:00,895 --> 00:26:02,515
lot i'm worried that you're gonna constantly

777
00:26:02,515 --> 00:26:05,155
be rethinking of this one memory and

778
00:26:05,155 --> 00:26:07,225
it's going to suddenly overwrite some of

779
00:26:07,225 --> 00:26:08,845
your memories that you should be remembering

780
00:26:09,715 --> 00:26:11,365
till all my memories are just yes

781
00:26:14,545 --> 00:26:16,645
every time i remember places another member

782
00:26:16,645 --> 00:26:19,345
is i'm worried about this it'll eventually

783
00:26:19,345 --> 00:26:20,665
i don't know what my birthday is

784
00:26:21,235 --> 00:26:23,095
i don't know meh whatever thing i

785
00:26:23,095 --> 00:26:25,195
was at this intersection was very wide

786
00:26:25,225 --> 00:26:30,205
ah i don't know i mean like

787
00:26:30,295 --> 00:26:31,465
oh you know why else it kind

788
00:26:31,465 --> 00:26:32,545
of i realised why

789
00:26:32,845 --> 00:26:34,915
it also that intersection freaks me out

790
00:26:35,305 --> 00:26:36,775
because i was at it was a

791
00:26:36,775 --> 00:26:39,115
similar intersection where i had a horrific

792
00:26:39,115 --> 00:26:40,765
car accident where i totaled my wife's

793
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:43,375
car because i did not see a

794
00:26:43,375 --> 00:26:45,505
stop sign i blew through stop signs

795
00:26:45,505 --> 00:26:47,515
so you so you're you told one

796
00:26:47,515 --> 00:26:49,315
story where you're in the right but

797
00:26:49,315 --> 00:26:52,705
you're really also stop at la

798
00:26:52,705 --> 00:26:54,205
nah let's stop signs to make up

799
00:26:54,205 --> 00:26:55,195
for that so true

800
00:26:55,885 --> 00:26:57,863
it's so true how many stop signs

801
00:26:57,865 --> 00:26:59,395
are worth a car so they make

802
00:26:59,395 --> 00:27:04,675
these stop signs octagonal octagonal octagonal octagonal

803
00:27:04,675 --> 00:27:06,385
is this where the podcast has gone

804
00:27:06,715 --> 00:27:08,695
and it's so easy you will notice

805
00:27:08,695 --> 00:27:10,244
these things paul sure we get back

806
00:27:12,655 --> 00:27:14,785
you'll be like wait that sign is

807
00:27:14,785 --> 00:27:16,795
not square i gotta look at this

808
00:27:16,795 --> 00:27:19,075
thing right and yet you just were

809
00:27:19,075 --> 00:27:20,995
like oh octagon who gives a shit

810
00:27:21,055 --> 00:27:22,165
and you just went right through it

811
00:27:22,165 --> 00:27:23,845
is that subspace relays the story yes

812
00:27:23,845 --> 00:27:27,775
stop sign that it's more what lauren

813
00:27:27,775 --> 00:27:29,425
is saying what you're saying although i'm

814
00:27:29,425 --> 00:27:30,805
not just coming your theory that it

815
00:27:30,805 --> 00:27:31,585
was obscured in

816
00:27:31,615 --> 00:27:33,445
some way they also make them read

817
00:27:33,445 --> 00:27:34,675
so you can be like well that's

818
00:27:34,675 --> 00:27:36,025
not a white sign or a yellow

819
00:27:36,025 --> 00:27:37,165
sign this is a red one i

820
00:27:37,165 --> 00:27:38,545
wanted to paint the wrong shade of

821
00:27:38,545 --> 00:27:40,285
red you'd be like wow no that's

822
00:27:40,285 --> 00:27:41,905
not real it's a little french club

823
00:27:41,905 --> 00:27:43,705
was maroon i don't know that i

824
00:27:43,705 --> 00:27:45,895
would take a lighter copper like blood

825
00:27:45,985 --> 00:27:47,275
red bull in a way

826
00:27:48,385 --> 00:27:50,125
you think blood looks like copper lead

827
00:27:50,125 --> 00:27:51,835
tastes like copper tastes like like cup

828
00:27:51,835 --> 00:27:54,475
but but it's brown it certainly blood

829
00:27:54,475 --> 00:27:56,275
is brown not really red that's when

830
00:27:56,275 --> 00:27:57,355
it dries really true

831
00:27:58,495 --> 00:28:00,385
you gotta admit it's a beautiful color

832
00:28:00,385 --> 00:28:01,585
when it's coming out of you oh

833
00:28:01,585 --> 00:28:03,355
it's beautiful rich and i are merely

834
00:28:03,385 --> 00:28:05,365
my hand it was always so flying

835
00:28:06,385 --> 00:28:10,793
nah you're getting blah oprah just gives

836
00:28:10,793 --> 00:28:13,765
everybody yeah so you you just did

837
00:28:13,765 --> 00:28:15,325
not see the stop sign what were

838
00:28:15,325 --> 00:28:17,275
you going to say it i think

839
00:28:17,275 --> 00:28:18,685
i was reading a book but a

840
00:28:18,685 --> 00:28:19,435
book of my left

841
00:28:20,725 --> 00:28:22,495
i remember once i said to go

842
00:28:22,495 --> 00:28:24,955
love she's like oh this is when

843
00:28:25,315 --> 00:28:26,725
iphones were just coming out and she

844
00:28:26,725 --> 00:28:28,855
was like there a lot of studies

845
00:28:28,855 --> 00:28:30,025
that there are a lot of accidents

846
00:28:30,025 --> 00:28:32,065
caused by people looking at their iphones

847
00:28:32,065 --> 00:28:32,845
and i was like it's just the

848
00:28:32,845 --> 00:28:34,165
same as reading the newspaper on your

849
00:28:34,165 --> 00:28:36,292
way to work it's just like why

850
00:28:36,292 --> 00:28:38,215
you shouldn't be doing that either are

851
00:28:38,215 --> 00:28:40,375
you doing that occasionally like if you

852
00:28:40,375 --> 00:28:40,705
had to go

853
00:28:40,705 --> 00:28:43,705
go to ah like santa monica and

854
00:28:43,705 --> 00:28:46,615
you're stuck in literal like votes before

855
00:28:46,705 --> 00:28:48,475
four or five one one entertain there's

856
00:28:48,535 --> 00:28:50,215
no movement you will stay there for

857
00:28:50,215 --> 00:28:52,255
forty five minutes just barely moving so

858
00:28:52,255 --> 00:28:55,165
everybody hurts so yeah i think that's

859
00:28:55,165 --> 00:28:56,365
when people used to people like putting

860
00:28:56,365 --> 00:28:58,225
their makeup on and doing all sorts

861
00:28:58,225 --> 00:29:00,835
of dangerous changing their clothes danger

862
00:29:00,865 --> 00:29:03,148
it's assigning jennifer beals takes her bra

863
00:29:03,148 --> 00:29:05,485
off thunder's switch that's what got her

864
00:29:05,485 --> 00:29:07,375
the audition etc got her the role

865
00:29:09,025 --> 00:29:10,945
she's rather do that at a restaurant

866
00:29:11,215 --> 00:29:13,885
okay we have this written into a

867
00:29:13,885 --> 00:29:14,365
script

868
00:29:16,705 --> 00:29:18,027
no she did it in the audition

869
00:29:18,027 --> 00:29:19,615
in so adrian lyne cast her in

870
00:29:19,615 --> 00:29:21,355
the thing and she put it into

871
00:29:21,355 --> 00:29:22,705
the thing she did it in her

872
00:29:22,705 --> 00:29:24,655
audition yes she was just like kind

873
00:29:24,655 --> 00:29:25,975
of bold move i wouldn't think to

874
00:29:25,975 --> 00:29:27,265
do you should do it in your

875
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:29,185
next audition yeah you're broad i'll just

876
00:29:29,185 --> 00:29:32,005

877
00:29:32,005 --> 00:29:34,015
like what should i maybe i should

878
00:29:34,015 --> 00:29:35,570
take my bra no i think she

879
00:29:35,755 --> 00:29:37,525
what's the scene that were happening and

880
00:29:37,542 --> 00:29:39,085
no no this this was like just

881
00:29:39,085 --> 00:29:40,315
in a meeting i think it wasn't

882
00:29:40,315 --> 00:29:42,505
even like that's actually her reading order

883
00:29:42,775 --> 00:29:44,425
she she was just like talking to

884
00:29:44,575 --> 00:29:46,375
to him and just like was changing

885
00:29:46,375 --> 00:29:47,365
and kind of did that and he

886
00:29:47,365 --> 00:29:48,831
was like it was a different time

887
00:29:48,865 --> 00:29:51,505
gotta put this in my moods also

888
00:29:51,655 --> 00:29:53,875
this was her first big thing yeah

889
00:29:53,905 --> 00:29:55,765
nothing like to be an unknown

890
00:29:55,825 --> 00:29:57,895
can be true and you're you're like

891
00:29:58,285 --> 00:29:59,925
i'm gonna go for it i i

892
00:30:00,115 --> 00:30:01,015
don't think of it i don't think

893
00:30:01,015 --> 00:30:02,275
it was i was actually just so

894
00:30:02,305 --> 00:30:04,885
you're mischaracterizing it she was not a

895
00:30:04,885 --> 00:30:06,535
plan know i'm doing that on purpose

896
00:30:06,745 --> 00:30:09,385
oh why though it's it amuses me

897
00:30:09,385 --> 00:30:09,895
to do so

898
00:30:11,815 --> 00:30:13,645
i like to think of jennifer beals

899
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:16,105
with a whiteboard before this meeting wanting

900
00:30:16,105 --> 00:30:18,265
this thing yeah she's practicing to call

901
00:30:18,265 --> 00:30:20,125
raleigh i love her she i'm all

902
00:30:20,125 --> 00:30:22,375
caught up and oh really generation q

903
00:30:22,405 --> 00:30:24,055
and i'm not but you love her

904
00:30:24,175 --> 00:30:25,165
is it was great we had a

905
00:30:25,165 --> 00:30:27,205
lot of bet in this season and

906
00:30:27,205 --> 00:30:28,885
a nice finale ending that was a

907
00:30:28,885 --> 00:30:30,025
good story for her do you know

908
00:30:30,025 --> 00:30:31,105
what i want to rewatch

909
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:33,010
and the theater when it came out

910
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:34,570
and i it's not a good movie

911
00:30:34,570 --> 00:30:37,900
from what i recall the bride oh

912
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:39,703
the bride of frankenstein yeah i've heard

913
00:30:39,703 --> 00:30:42,640
of that and sting plays doctor frankenstein

914
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:44,410
oh i was just hearing that he's

915
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:47,620
a good actor where i'm smart less

916
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,930
why because they're talking about bano his

917

00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:03,100
phone talking to the insurance person i

1076
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:05,260
guess and they're like well can you

1077
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:07,480

1078
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:10,630

00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:14,350
the car and i audibly this is

1080
00:36:14,350 --> 00:36:15,790
all one speaker i audibly heard the

1081
00:36:15,790 --> 00:36:19,030
person say well you're not suppose

1082
00:36:19,041 --> 00:36:23,410
used to do ah that's really tough

1083
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:27,430
that's a tough one though because ah

1084
00:36:27,850 --> 00:36:29,050
i feel like

1085
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:32,470
you need someone to tell you that

1086
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,960
yeah it's not a given about this

1087
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,700
type of thing because it's giving registration

1088
00:36:36,730 --> 00:36:38,470
don't you think somebody always does though

1089
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:40,360
probably i mean i was told at

1090
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:41,680
some point i know but i'm saying

1091
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:42,940
yeah i don't know who told me

1092
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:44,320
or why i know that yeah but

1093
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,240
like there's to be an official guidelines

1094
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:48,970
to be like license registration slash i

1095
00:36:48,970 --> 00:36:49,990
think in your mind you can also

1096
00:36:49,990 --> 00:36:50,200
kind of

1097
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:51,730
oh title is registered yeah i don't

1142
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:19,210

1144
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:24,280
like floating and and everyone around him

1145
00:38:24,310 --> 00:38:26,920
in on the sidewalks are gone whoa

1146
00:38:26,950 --> 00:38:29,530
but they're all actors are paid they're

1147
00:38:29,590 --> 00:38:31,360
not only i think are they actor

1148
00:38:31,390 --> 00:38:32,560
you could be an actor you can

1149
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,610
be paid but you got people

1150
00:38:34,930 --> 00:38:37,000
they're either their life kids they're either

1151
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,190
actors or they have to film it

1152
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:40,930
so many times because so many people

1153
00:38:40,930 --> 00:38:42,910
can see how he's doing it that

1154
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:45,190
the few times where he's doing it

1155
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:47,830
with the exact right angle where knowing

1156
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:49,600
i see that he's actually standing on

1157
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:52,480
the ground right um they go whoa

1158
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,860
and they're like oh thank god we

1159
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:54,460
got one

1160
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:55,960
i've wasted so much time yeah i

1161
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:57,100
mean i'm sure a lot of stuff

1162
00:38:57,130 --> 00:39:00,010
is phases which i just you know

1163
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:02,230
i assume i mean sometimes bags aren't

1164
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:04,450
real magic know i know i don't

1165
00:39:04,450 --> 00:39:05,980
think that but i do think some

1166
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:07,750
tricks are being performed in real time

1167
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:09,340
and my person doesn't understand how it

1168
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:10,570
happened but i also think like the

1169
00:39:10,570 --> 00:39:12,760
david copperfield making the statue of liberty

1170
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:14,950
disappear is bad because it's like

1171
00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:16,120
like hey we're gonna do this and

1172
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:18,520
he has a crowd right and then

1173
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:20,110
it's a simple camera trick right they

1174
00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:21,220
do and the way it was i

1175
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:24,310
saw it explained is basically like the

1176
00:39:24,310 --> 00:39:26,950
cameras pointed at the statue of liberty

1177
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,770
they put a curtain down yeah they

1178
00:39:29,770 --> 00:39:33,490
move the camera like slightly clockwise to

1179
00:39:33,490 --> 00:39:34,960
a part where the statue of liberty

1180
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:35,110
is

1181
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:37,090
not they raised the curtain and the

1182
00:39:37,090 --> 00:39:38,980
statue of liberty isn't there but the

1183
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:41,830
whole crowd is going whoa but they're

1184
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:43,420
just the wires yeah they're liars the

1185
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:45,100
crowd can see the statue of liberty

1186
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:46,330
is right over there where that where

1187
00:39:46,330 --> 00:39:47,830
it's always seems like a waste of

1188
00:39:47,830 --> 00:39:49,540
time do you know i did that

1189
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,400
the pretty much the same thing at

1190
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,900
the end of my last comedy special

1191
00:39:53,050 --> 00:39:55,113
but i the statue of liberty disappear

1192
00:39:55,270 --> 00:39:56,710
i did that from nobody cared somebody

1193
00:39:56,710 --> 00:39:57,940
said dave cup fiore did that and

1194
00:39:57,940 --> 00:39:59,678
i was like oh yeah didn't we

1195
00:39:59,678 --> 00:40:01,690

yesterday i ah i ended the special

1197
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:08,320

was going to throw a smoke bomb

1199
00:40:11,350 --> 00:40:12,940
down on the floor and then disappear

1200
00:40:13,810 --> 00:40:15,430
and so it was it was

1201
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:16,540
all done in post but i had

1202
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:19,450

i'm gonna jump back i'm gonna go

1207
00:40:27,310 --> 00:40:29,170
like this because i didn't actually have

1208
00:40:29,170 --> 00:40:31,840
a smoke bomb right um and then

1209
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:34,690
i'm gonna walk off so that the

1210
00:40:34,690 --> 00:40:35,500

there study they did i think we

1224
00:40:59,530 --> 00:41:01,090
did it one time they did it

1225
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:02,680
they nailed it it was great but

1226
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:05,140
your whole audience was like oscar-winning actors

1227
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:06,910
oh yeah oh let's i yeah full

1228
00:41:06,910 --> 00:41:09,850
disclosure my old buddy d day was

1229
00:41:09,850 --> 00:41:10,420
there

1230
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:14,260
who's daniel daniel c o o like

1231
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:17,440
de de de de de pretty much

1232
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,760

de de de de da de di

1234
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:21,520
do you want to talk about your

1235
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:22,900
and then he retired from acting because

1236
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:25,930
of that trick was involved him putting

1237
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:27,820
so that he had a woman look

1238
00:41:27,850 --> 00:41:29,290
at a deck of cards she chose

1239
00:41:29,290 --> 00:41:30,850
one in her mind you know the

1240
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:31,600
the card

1241
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:33,430
yeah he put the whole duck in

1242
00:41:33,430 --> 00:41:36,183
between her two hands very tightly and

1243
00:41:36,183 --> 00:41:37,270
put the whole tech in her hands

1244
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:39,940
yeah and then he reached in and

1245
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:42,490
like grabbed the card and it was

1246
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:44,530
the proper card right and she was

1247
00:41:44,530 --> 00:41:45,940
like wow and then he shit wasn't

1248
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:48,070
that i'm pro and then he goes

1249
00:41:48,070 --> 00:41:49,930
yeah it's pretty crazy because there's not

1250
00:41:49,930 --> 00:41:51,640
even any carter and then in her

1251
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:51,820
hand

1252
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:53,290
just a brick of glass

1253
00:41:55,630 --> 00:41:57,310
so i was like that's amazing

1254
00:41:58,090 --> 00:41:59,590
however you're doing that is amazing i

1255
00:41:59,590 --> 00:42:02,020
don't like i don't know at all

1256
00:42:02,050 --> 00:42:03,820
how that's possible that someone wouldn't feel

1257
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:05,230
their hands too and a lot of

1258
00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:07,300
tricks involve that yeah with someone holding

1259
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:08,860
something and then it is something else

1260
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:11,200
and i'm like how how did they

1261
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:13,630
not feel tiny shift in their hands

1262
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:16,840
timelines tiny mimes as well yeah mice

1263
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:18,010
and mimes it's sort of cool

1264
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:21,340
that that majority minds tiny minds oh

1265
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:23,380
yes well they throw the cards into

1266
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:25,570
tiny tiny minds i just met their

1267
00:42:25,570 --> 00:42:27,460
barrel were stupid yeah but i think

1268
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:28,960
it's cool how magicians like refuse to

1269
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,640
share their secrets do i think it's

1270
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:32,800
cool things rude i it's kind of

1271
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:33,940
cool because it's like if i could

1272
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:35,260
just know right now i don't think

1273
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:37,330
i'd be that happy as a person

1274
00:42:37,396 --> 00:42:38,140
you're right

1275
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:39,820
no but i'm a happy person because

1276
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:41,770

yeah um we're being very sassy today

1344
00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:08,980
everybody alright so what this is the

1345
00:45:08,980 --> 00:45:12,040
game mostly it's what we start within

1346
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:15,100
an improvised scene where we're all improvising

1347
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:16,810
okay i'm yeah i guess we're not

1348
00:45:16,810 --> 00:45:18,640
playing ourselves we can be whoever true

1349
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,530
i don't want to play myself

1350
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:28,210
oh to be a charter right duh

1351
00:45:28,750 --> 00:45:30,250
so we do one or two minutes

1352
00:45:30,250 --> 00:45:31,990
how long do you think we do

1353
00:45:31,990 --> 00:45:34,450
this you think one yes okay one

1354
00:45:34,450 --> 00:45:36,280
minute to last couple minutes feels like

1355
00:45:36,280 --> 00:45:38,650
an eternity when we're doing a game

1356
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:40,720
and then we switch roles and try

1357
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:42,340
to do it as accurately as possible

1358
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:44,260
to the previous time oh so you

1359
00:45:44,260 --> 00:45:45,220
really had to listen to each other

1360
00:45:45,250 --> 00:45:47,530
then we switch roles it's up again

1361
00:45:47,860 --> 00:45:48,700
it's gonna be really

1362
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:50,590
tough and try to do it as

1363
00:45:50,590 --> 00:45:52,870
accurately as possible then we switch back

1364
00:45:52,870 --> 00:45:54,880
to our original roles and try to

1365
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:56,380
do it and try to remember everything

1366
00:45:56,380 --> 00:45:58,720
