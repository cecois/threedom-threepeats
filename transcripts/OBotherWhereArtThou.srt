also

54
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,210
she could've been lying about how much

55
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:55,560
money was in there well that's true

56
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,520
for what missing it could have been

57
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:57,900
she could yeah there might have been

58
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,280
no money in there there might have

59
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,840

63
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:10,140

them out as change at universal

99
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,580

102
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,730
hell i probably said that my family

00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,960
members are bills i have a lot

104
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,240
of schiller bills it's a it's a

105
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,399
tradition let's stop doing the show we

106
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,350
a two dollar bill we've talked about

107
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:33,030
it because you talked about but i

108
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:34,080
think we were saying about

109
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:35,580
yeah it was two dollars difference but

110
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:37,440
was there some about three dollars i

111
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,910
don't think that that was three dollars

112
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:41,250
or eight hundred to one nine years

113
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:43,650
were used okay until they release a

114
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:45,780
three dollar bill i want more weird

115
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:48,120
currency what strange currents it's weird that

116
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,320
they they only go up to one

117
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:52,980
hundred is considering with ah inviting circulation

118
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,240
yeah in circulation but cah

119
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,610
considering how high inflation is now and

120
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:58,050
how like no one ever uses the

121
00:03:58,050 --> 00:03:59,520
one like no one ever uses coins

122
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,992
anymore did you feel like when they

123
00:04:00,992 --> 00:04:02,580
got a new one he's out it's

124
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:04,436
not true they'll seem weird there's just

125
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:06,090
no point there's still paying a parking

126
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:07,470
meters where you have to that is

127
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:08,730
true and that's fucked up and i

128
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:11,040
also think that there are too many

129
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,720
places that don't accept cash now i

130
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,130
think that's elitist yes

131
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:16,140
yeah i think there's also like like

132
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,850
laundromats and stuff a lot of them

133
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:19,076
you still have to use coin using

134
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:21,180
ct axis of annoying but but i

135
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:22,380
guess what i'm trying to say is

136
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:24,450
it's what with inflation and like no

137
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:26,430
one uses pennies well legislation let's just

138
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:27,870
say that and nichols were on their

139
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:29,160
way to your question let me tell

140
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:32,190
you times i think they're not long

141
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:33,750
for this world as we've i love

142
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:34,530
it to coins

143
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:37,230
are problematic yeah but but they're my

144
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:39,390
fave but yeah i like the problem

145
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:41,670
animal i'm liking how more places are

146
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:43,620
having the app thing for for paying

147
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:46,140
for parking but i think that that's

148
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:48,210
also it's only problem because i think

149
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:50,610
what even just if you're old and

150
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:51,510
you don't know how to use an

151
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:53,036
axe you have to finish it always

152
00:04:53,036 --> 00:04:54,720
download the ash always been an op

153
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,450
option yeah yeah but i guess like

154
00:04:57,450 --> 00:04:58,860
may start making a two hundred dollar

155
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:01,320

156
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:03,990

um i love that they're always like

242
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,220
a year out of date with sly

243
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:56,190
yeah yeah oh yeah um do you

244
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:58,500
think was it by the way like

245
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,360
posters are now being used for emphasis

246
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:00,930
you're pointing

247
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:04,140
do you think that is it like

248
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,180
could it have been like that gumby

249
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:07,711
where the guy dresses up as gumby

250
00:08:07,711 --> 00:08:09,150
because the dog loves the gumby toy

251
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:11,190
so like maybe maybe there was more

252
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:12,930
to it i'd that's an amazing i'll

253
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:14,610
tell you i didn't even finish watching

254
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,378
that's why i was like maybe they

255
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:18,120
pointed all of the edge i don't

256
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,548
care you've seen the gumby video i've

257
00:08:20,548 --> 00:08:22,073
seen doubly so that the dog was

258
00:08:22,073 --> 00:08:22,320
a toy

259
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:25,260
toy of gumby and then the entire

260
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:27,570
setup like a dad dresses up like

261
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:29,670
a giant gumball and their dog is

262
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:32,190
so happy because it's a combination of

263
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:34,380
everything like obviously you can smell it

264
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:37,440
says yes his dad it's danny tell

265
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,780
it to doing grumpy i don't know

266
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:41,550
if you have a dog or you

267
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:42,330
are the parent

268
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,280
of the dog yeah of course he

269
00:08:44,286 --> 00:08:47,220
can i somehow big i honestly don't

270
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:48,450
think that if like a giant really

271
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:49,950
made a connection between that being the

272
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:51,570
same as his toy if a giant

273
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,852
you don't think he can i maybe

274
00:08:53,852 --> 00:08:55,230
you can if a giant gumby came

275
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:57,690
down back stomped through the ceiling but

276
00:08:57,690 --> 00:08:59,460
he's still excited i don't know if

277
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:00,990
i look up and say like oh

278
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:02,640
that's gumby i think honestly

279
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:04,290
feels like that dog did know yeah

280
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:05,940
i don't think every dog would know

281
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,220
i think the thing that i think

282
00:09:08,227 --> 00:09:10,050
the digest basically show you drunk fish

283
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:11,310
because i think i get your wish

284
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:12,780
there was another video that i saw

285
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:15,030

were trying to get there yeah and

325
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:43,560

327
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,250

yeah we've get our way there and

335
00:10:58,350 --> 00:10:59,220

336
00:10:59,220 --> 00:10:59,430
there

337
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:01,590
yeah and he's causing more trouble than

338
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:03,510
he's helping when he's not helping matter

339
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:07,050

three cheer that i just found okay

1143
00:38:02,986 --> 00:38:03,885
listen this is

1144
00:38:03,885 --> 00:38:07,185
is submitted by michael pier c and

1145
00:38:07,185 --> 00:38:10,725
it's kyle's that's called call of old

1146
00:38:10,785 --> 00:38:13,815
it's cold it's cold that's not how

1147
00:38:13,845 --> 00:38:15,015
grandpa tells it

1148
00:38:16,125 --> 00:38:19,575
okay so we improvise a two minute

1149
00:38:19,575 --> 00:38:23,417
scene of something relatively boring great guy

1150
00:38:23,505 --> 00:38:26,055
of he's just played the first part

1151
00:38:26,055 --> 00:38:28,335
of the show and then after two

1152
00:38:28,335 --> 00:38:28,935
minutes

1153
00:38:30,435 --> 00:38:32,475
after two minutes someone says that's not

1154
00:38:32,475 --> 00:38:35,745
how grandma tells it ah then we

1155
00:38:35,745 --> 00:38:37,245
do the same scene again but everything

1156
00:38:37,245 --> 00:38:39,885
is exaggerated and over dramatic like the

1157
00:38:39,885 --> 00:38:42,015
way as this is what michael pearson

1158
00:38:42,015 --> 00:38:43,365
says the way a stupid old man

1159
00:38:43,365 --> 00:38:45,495
would tell a story she's right yeah

1160
00:38:45,495 --> 00:38:48,375
affect your soul back to your exactly

1161
00:38:48,375 --> 00:38:49,965
we will do this though alright

1162
00:38:50,265 --> 00:38:50,985
yeah absolutely

1163
00:38:51,645 --> 00:38:54,735
we will mock yielded only because whoever

1164
00:38:54,735 --> 00:38:57,315
told us to so maybe for god's

1165
00:38:57,315 --> 00:38:59,865
name are you guys ready to do

1166
00:39:00,495 --> 00:39:02,235
that's not how grandpa toe and who

1167
00:39:02,235 --> 00:39:03,795
wants to say that's not how grandpa

1168
00:39:03,795 --> 00:39:07,635
tells it i'll say you sam yeah

1169
00:39:07,755 --> 00:39:09,645

here we go two minutes

1173
00:39:19,785 --> 00:39:22,725
well you know so it all started

1174
00:39:22,725 --> 00:39:25,905
because the rain was pouring down and

1175
00:39:25,965 --> 00:39:27,525
i wish it would pour up sometime

1176
00:39:27,525 --> 00:39:28,995
i know but then so what happened

1177
00:39:28,995 --> 00:39:31,455
was this this like the sort of

1178
00:39:31,455 --> 00:39:34,125
like parade of dogs kind of came

1179
00:39:34,125 --> 00:39:36,585
through and they were like mania things

1180
00:39:36,873 --> 00:39:38,775
it was like a literal parade or

1181
00:39:38,775 --> 00:39:39,885
it was just you're saying per

1182
00:39:39,885 --> 00:39:41,175
parade like there were a bunch of

1183
00:39:41,175 --> 00:39:41,415
dogs

1184
00:39:42,525 --> 00:39:43,965
we're just a bunch of dogs there's

1185
00:39:43,965 --> 00:39:45,615
a bunch of yeah i'll just a

1186
00:39:45,615 --> 00:39:48,525
mundane bunch of dogs yeah what is

1187
00:39:48,525 --> 00:39:49,935
so weird that dogs all hang out

1188
00:39:49,935 --> 00:39:50,235
together

1189
00:39:51,465 --> 00:39:53,205
they got set loose i don't know

1190
00:39:53,565 --> 00:39:54,645
and it was one from like a

1191
00:39:54,645 --> 00:39:56,355
dog nose one note here's what about

1192
00:39:56,355 --> 00:39:58,455
a broken was one dog that was

1193
00:39:58,455 --> 00:39:59,445
lost in the neighborhood there was a

1194
00:39:59,445 --> 00:40:00,945
sign up for months yeah it was

1195
00:40:00,945 --> 00:40:03,135
pouring rain yeah this dog came running

1196
00:40:03,135 --> 00:40:05,145
down the street it had like ah

1197
00:40:05,295 --> 00:40:08,565
no collar and some people you know

1198
00:40:08,565 --> 00:40:11,295
grabbed put in their car and that's

1199
00:40:11,325 --> 00:40:11,475
i

1200
00:40:11,565 --> 00:40:12,735
think how they got it back i

1201
00:40:12,735 --> 00:40:13,875
don't know how they even found out

1202
00:40:14,355 --> 00:40:16,545
who are they addressing the dogs the

1203
00:40:16,545 --> 00:40:18,555
people yeah i think they put on

1204
00:40:18,555 --> 00:40:19,605
like dog years to try to get

1205
00:40:19,605 --> 00:40:20,950
it's attention or some like yeah just

1206
00:40:20,950 --> 00:40:21,465
try to finish

1207
00:40:23,115 --> 00:40:25,246
this makes sense are we doing what

1208
00:40:25,335 --> 00:40:26,715
most i don't think so i think

1209
00:40:26,805 --> 00:40:28,184
i don't know i mean it too

1210
00:40:28,184 --> 00:40:30,975

telling a story i don't know where

1212
00:40:33,285 --> 00:40:37,365

1213
00:40:37,365 --> 00:40:38,655
when you start telling the story it

1214
00:40:38,655 --> 00:40:41,805

1461
00:49:46,405 --> 00:49:48,115
were right arm i think it's possible

1462
00:49:48,115 --> 00:49:49,075
to do it right the game is

1463
00:49:49,135 --> 00:49:50,875
flawed no i don't think the game

1464
00:49:50,875 --> 00:49:51,865
is flawed i think the players are

1465
00:49:51,865 --> 00:49:53,935
fighting players are definitely thankfully but you

1466
00:49:53,935 --> 00:49:55,165
can't give us a flawed game and

1467
00:49:55,165 --> 00:49:58,465
expect flawed players to do it totally

1468
00:49:58,495 --> 00:50:00,595
how do they use flaw don't give

1469
00:50:00,595 --> 00:50:02,245
us a flock game and expect flawed

1470
00:50:02,245 --> 00:50:03,865
players to make a plot and scene

1471
00:50:03,895 --> 00:50:06,475

1472
00:50:06,475 --> 00:50:08,305

1473
00:50:08,305 --> 00:50:09,295
