Joyously, she intensified her ardor until she gasped, dying - wishing, hoping, praying that he couldn't not return but he didn't. Thereby, however, hangs necks. Delicious, delicious turkey necks. Gobble the gobble. And when you have to smile a smile do you not smile the smile you want? No. You don't ever smile the smile you want. You have to murder teeth. Or else you won't get dental insurance. The only way you can try to get dental insurance is to marry a doctor. Are you a doctor? Because I want to marry you. Please marry me if you are a doctor. And scene. But, moreoever, when a little guy chances his luck then he has to take his chances. Little girls never make good pets. You have to put them in a box. Trapped under the staircase like that mommy-loving guy who we know and love from the Harry and hirsuite Potter. Who made a fortune making movies about pots. Hey, I wonder if you ever were to reply to my emails because I missed a few when I ate a poison gum. And I shouldn't have eaten that gum because it tasted like poison. Oh well. That's showbiz! Hey, come into my window. I want to show you how to make an orange soda in a bathtub. Concluding the story, I wish I could murder you again. You are dead. The end?"
